I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn't able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor's office because I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn't concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird.

I returned to my work station and noted a ""typical"" sore arm and slight fatigue. Appx. 5-6 hours later, the soreness increased significantly and was very uncomfortable. Tylenol 1300mg helped me fall asleep that night. The second day, the pain continued at the deltoid muscle and I was unable to raise my arm more than 90 degrees. The pain interrupted my ability to go about my daily activities or perform my job duties. That second night, the pain was debilitating to the point of crying and Tylenol was not helping. The third day, the severe arm pain continued and I was still in tears. I could not even raise my left arm to the level of my wait. I switched to ibuprofen with moderate success.   By the fourth day, 1/18, the pain had rescinded. I had little to no pain for the next four days (1/19/21 to 1/23/21). On Saturday, 1/23, I noticed my left arm was becoming sore again. Over the past three days, the soreness and pain have returned and have limited my ability to use my left arm. The arm pain disrupts my ability to get a good night's sleep as there is no position of comfort. When not moving, my left shoulder feels sore and uncomfortable. When moving my left arm, I feel pain when moving it in certain motions/directions. My range of motion is reduced and this along with the pain is disrupting my ability to drive my car, reach for objects and take a shower.   Because it has now been 12 days since my vaccine, I went to urgent care for help this morning. Because the pain left and then returned again, the physician determined that my mechanism of injury is not mechanical in nature, but most likely related to inflammation caused by the vaccine.

Within 30 minutes I could not move my arm and continued experiencing intense throbbing, aching,  and very limited movement.  I took Tylenol and iced it throughout the afternoon and night.  I could not raise my arm or bend my elbow without the help of my other arm and not without level 10 pain.  I went to Employee Health and Wellness Center the next morning. The nurse looked at the injection site, took off the band-aid from the day before and said the injection site was way too high.  She gave me a prescription for an anti-inflammatory and recommended Tylenol and Motrin for pain and intermittent icing.  After approximately 2-3 days I started to be able to bend my elbow and after a month I could raise my arm, but had to use the other arm to help lower it and it continued to be painful to move. I was unable to do any normal daily activities with my arm without alot of pain and continuous throbbing, aching, and burning in my arm and sharp pain in my shoulder area.  When the pain did not resolve and my ability to use my arm did not return I scheduled an appointment with an Orthopedist in early December and they took Xrays and prescribed an oral Steroid pack.  I took the Steroids pack over the course of a week with intermittent relief throughout the day for the week that I took it as long as I did not use it, but on day 6 when there was only one pill to take my arm began to ache and throb again by late afternoon and remained that way. In early January the orthopedic doctor ordered an MRI and prescribed anti-inflammatories.  To date I continue to have ongoing pain, throbbing, aching in my upper arm and sharp pain and aching in my shoulder despite, anti-inflammatory medication, Tylenol, icing, and limited use.  I cannot carrying anything, cross my arm in front over the midline, reach behind me , put any weight on it at all, or perform simple self-care and household duties without significant pain.  I cannot sleep at night as there is no comfortable way to sleep and I usually fall asleep for short periods of time in a chair. This has gone on for four months.

I have felt no side effects but when I read the story of the doctor who died of bleeding after that vaccination, I became concerned because I do get minor petechiae from the blood thinner and then yesterday (1/25) I noticed a petechiae different from the rest. It was on my back and was bigger than the few tiny pinpoint ones from the medication.  I am wondering if the vaccine made the difference and if my platelet count is going down. Is it possible that the vaccine might interact with blood thinners and create Thrombocytopenia? I have never heard of that disease before, but I think it can exist unknown or maybe be started by the vaccine. I will be watching for any additional petechiae, but would it be good to get a platelet test to see if something has gone wrong? The doctor with zero platelets, no symptoms and death by bleeding has caused me concern and if blood thinners, my eczema or undiagnosed Thrombocytopenia cause issues for vaccines, that information would be good to know. I am a 76 year old male in generally good health. My fitbit walking target is at least 4 miles/day and I usually reach that. At 5? 9? and 172 pounds I enjoy golf weekly when winter is over. Two issues do exist. Twenty seven months ago while searching for the cause of some PVCs the doctors put in a stent and scarred a diagonal artery causing what they said was a heart attack. Recovery was quick and subsequent tests indicate the heart was healed and working fine. I have no heart symptoms, but since then have been on first Brillinta and now Clopidorgrel (Plavix) plus baby aspirin. Second, last August I was diagnosed with eczema which might be psoriasis which I think is autoimmune related.

I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn't wiped properlyat the time, that's how out of it I was.

Within an hour after my injection , I began to feel tingling and numbness on the left side of my face beginning with my jaw and chin area. Over the following hour, the tingling and numbness spread to my lips, nose, eyelid, eyebrow, and the entire left side of my face and head. Around this time, my husband and son came downstairs to check on me noticed a change in my face and asked me ""What's wrong with your lip? It's like a different color or something different on one (left) side."" Approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes after the injection, the left side of my mouth and tongue were tingling and went numb. The left side of my face was noticeably weaker than my right and it became difficult to control my left eyelid and lips. My injection site became extremely tender as the evening wore on and I took two tylenol before going to bed to help with the pain. By the next morning on Saturday, the tingling had stopped, and my mouth/tongue were no longer numb, however weakness and occasional numbness persisted on the left side of my face, most especially my jawline and chin area. I noticed my left eye felt dry, so I began using eye drops occasionally. My injection site remained extremely painful throughout the day and I took tylenol and ibuprofen periodically to help with the discomfort and to allow me to sleep. By Saturday evening, no outward signs remained of my facial weakness on the left side, although I could still ""feel"" the difference. By Sunday morning, the numbness was only sporadic around my jawline and chin and I realized that when taking tylenol or ibuprofen, it seemed to improve sensation in my face. My injection site discomfort abated as Sunday wore on, but a slight weakness on the left side of my face persisted, noticeable only to myself. The weakness has persisted through today (Tuesday evening), however, it does seem slightly improved each day and it is mild. I am able to work and function normally.

0976080,01/26/2021,NY,63.0,63,,M,,"I, the patient, went to Pharmacy get the Shingrix shot--I am 63 years old in superb health and have never had a very serious vaccine reaction in my life.  This includes yearly flu shots for approx 40 years and the PPSV23 pneumoccocal vaccine.  I believe I've also had the Hepatitis B vaccine administered by my MD as well in the past year or two.  I have never had anything more than a sore arm for a day or two.  I basically get my vaccine and forget about it.  Maybe I skip a day or two of workouts.  On Sunday, 1/102021 I received shot #1 of the Shingrix vaccine at approximately 5 pm.  I returned home and began working out.  By 7 pm I felt chills and cut my workout short.  By Monday I had a three inch long red mark in the area below the injection site.  It was warm to the touch and hurt when I pushed on it.   No worry I said, this is a sign the vaccine is working.  Let me add that I believe in vaccines, science and completed pre-Med biology at with a B+ and A- respectively.  My father was a doctor, now deceased.  I trust in modern medicine and yes, I will get shot #2 when the time comes.   I volunteer at an animal adoption agency and my cohort on Tues/Fri is a visiting Registered Nurse.  When she saw the reaction on my arm she said, ""oh my, that's not normal.""  That evening began the worst symptoms: extreme fatigue, body aches and pains, fevers and bad chills.  After a few days of this, I said I need to get Covid tested.  I already was an ""early adopter"" of Covid-19 when it first swept through --I was ill 3/17-4/1 and beat the illness by myself in my loft.    My annual physical indicates that I still had antibodies on 11/23/20 and my blood tests on 1/21/21 reconfirmed that 9 months later I still had antibodies.  I have two NEG nasal swab tests from two different providers and am awaiting on a third one from yet another provider.  This reaction is not COVID!  As of day 16 (today), the body aches and pains have gradually subsided--I honestly can't remember when they stopped being so bad.  I feel like I am operating at 50% energy capacity.  Normally due to my diet and exercise regimen, I have the energy of a 25 year old.  Having survived both Covid and severe pneumonia at age 19, I know how important self-monitoring is.  I took my temperature several times a day, every day.    I discovered a daily pattern in the past week and it is highly predictable.   Approximately 7-9 pm severe chills start in spite of my body temperature usually being around 98.2, 98.3.  These chills occur in spite of the fact that my apartment is always heated at 76 degrees or more in the winter--I""m on the top floor of my building and I have lowered the thermostat as low as I can without turning off my system.   These chills occur when I am in bed laying under three layers of blankets in sweatpants and a sweatshirt or the equivalent.  How is it possible to have chills at a normal body temperature under these circumstances?   About an hour later  the chills stop, my fever rises,   usually 101.6 to a high so far of 102.9.  Now I am feeling extremely hot and the chills stop.  I wake up daily to sweat soaked sheets.",,,,,,,,,N,01/10/2021,01/10/2021,0,Blood & urine tests 1/21/21,PHM,,Finasteride Turmeric Ginger Probiotic Vitamin E Vitamin C Vitamin D3 Vitamin B12 EPA/DHA (fish oil caplets),None,None,,,2,01/26/2021,,Y,,None

Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn't help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn't touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn't get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn't have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room.

She was unsure if it was vasovagal or a blood clot in her lungs. She did get it checked out with a cat scan and there was no clot. They had to have tested her for anaphylaxis at that time. It was not a clear diagnose. Then she saw a cardiologist. She was diagnosed with vasovagal at that time. It lasted only a few months and she was fully recovered).

Within 30 seconds she was completely fine. She did feel a little out of it, as it produced a little bit of anxiety. She had no other symptoms. She stayed at the facility for 30 minutes. As she was leaving one person asked how she felt and she was told to let the EMTs know. She let them know what happened. One woman working there said it could have been an anxiety attack. She did not have a lot of anxiety but she did have some. It did not feel like that. She had never had the warm sensations or heart racing. She was totally fine when talking to the EMTs. They did not seem concerned and they let her schedule her second shot. She read on Pfizer about allergic reactions. She was assuming this was what happened. A mild allergic reaction. She had no breathing issues or hives. Her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it. She had also never had this type of soreness with vaccines.

After the vaccine she felt dizzy but didn't feel faint, and had a racing heart. Nobody seemed concerned about her reaction and getting the second dose.

A patient of unspecified age (Age: 74; Unit: Unknown) and gender received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold and extremely ill from 1981 to an unknown date. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated, ""I was reading the fact sheet that was given to me after I received my Vaccine on the 10Jan2021 and I developed a strange thing which was the cough. I don't cough. I never had a cold since 1981 that is not being exaggerated that is the truth because I was extremely ill. So I know it was 1981. About 6 hours after I came home from getting the injection. I do not know, there was the burning in the back of my throat. So I gargled some salt water but it did not go away. By the evening I had a horrible cough and burning all the way down my esophagus and I was coughing. I don't cough it's not that. I am well, my lungs are well I never cough. Next morning again I was coughing. If I sat still and didn't move it stopped and then it would started again when I get up and move around. The coughing was like a raspy cough that was strange. I have never experienced anything like it. However, on the morning of the 13th of Jan2021, 3 days after the injection I began to spit up a slime which was a yellow color. Now I don't do that, it is not a part of my healthcare, my lungs are fine, I have never smoked, not one sign of lung problems ever. So I spit up the big thing of this slime. The next morning which was yesterday, I spit up another blob of slime and today the cough is gone like I never had it. Now I know this is not the normal for me, this has never happened to me before and so it is either a coincidence. I had the injection which I requested and the symptoms began slowly in the evening after I got the injection on the 10Jan and stopped last night, it just stopped, the last bit of slime came out of mouth, out of my lungs and the coughing stuff and that what happened. I don't know what that is but I have a feeling that the two are related in some manner. I am not a sickly person, I had nothing going on in my body, I am very lucky, I am 74 and I had nothing. So this was surprise and shock. This may be an interest to your survey. I have been in this house for eleven months. I have not left. I have had food brought to me and I have had medicines (Unspecified Medications) brought to me and no one has come into my home since eleven months. So if I have somehow contracted this virus. God only knows because this little known and no one comes in my home and I am isolated for 11 months. That is how hard I have trying not to get the virus. I have not, have I been taking medication and been to a doctor no, I have not. I have just been in my house.""

However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt ""funny"" mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised ""bed rest and hydration"") I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up.

Per email with follow up information:   Reviewed with pt and with RN that administered the vaccine.  Check in staff did not have memory of the event.    Patient recollection of events: Pt reported that she was asked about if it was her first or second dose and confirmed it was her second dose and had her CDC card with her.  She was here for her second Pfizer.   During check in the pt stated that she was given a card for room 7 and the card was blue (Moderna). Pt stated that she had a conversation with the administering RN about it being her second dose and stated she was to have Pfizer.  She does not recall is she had her card out in the administration bay.   Pt stated she received the vaccine and was in the waiting area when she received the text from the state thanking her for getting her Moderna vaccine.  At this point she approached registration and informed them of the issue.  She spoke with Dr. X, who was volunteering in the clinic at the time.  Pt was told that she did not need to receive another shot at that time (this has been confirmed with the state).   Reviewed with the pt that she would not need to get another shot and that we would be reporting the issue.  She was appreciative of the call and understood to let me know if she had any other questions or concerns   RNs recollection of events: RN recalls giving the vaccine but does not recall verifying the card (CDC) or in Zotec about the brand of the second dose.  She recalls that the pt had the blue (Moderna) card for the room.  She was on the Moderna hallway at the time of the admin.    Process review: Typically, when we are administering 2 different vaccines, the clinic is evenly divided, with one row being Moderna (blue) and with the other row being Pfizer (red).  On 1/25/21, due to high volume of Pfizer second doses, we opened rooms in our Moderna row for Pfizer vaccine.  These rooms have red cards placed in them to match the red room number cards and the red flags on the vaccine.  The remaining Moderna rooms had blue cards to match the blue room numbers and blue flags on the Moderna Vaccine. Vaccine administration staff only give one brand of vaccine at a time.  Room 7 was one of the rooms that had been converted earlier in the day.  At the time of the admin, the room was being operated as a Moderna room.    Gaps: -At check in when the pt was given a Moderna colored card and placed in a Moderna room.  The check in person likely still thought room 7 was a Pfizer room and did not recognize the wrong colored card.   -In the admin room, the administrator did not validate the prior vaccine, or did not recognize that the vaccine was not the same as what she was administering.    Actions: -Follow up completed with administering RN on verifying prior dose, both using the CDC card and in the Zotec system.   -Reviewed process for assigning room based on type of vaccine with admin staff and clinic leads to review daily with volunteer staff.   -Pt was called and updated and informed to call if any issues or questions.",,,,,,,,,,01/25/2021,01/25/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,01/27/2021,,,,

Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine.

A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 15:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a skilled nursing facility or long term care facility. The patient received no other vaccinations recently. Medical history included attention deficit disorder diagnosed at least 5 years ago for which the patient was taking Ritalin; hypothyroidism diagnosed a long time ago, probably 10 years and depression diagnosed a long time ago, probably at least 25 year, she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this (no further details provided about her anti-depressants). The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn't function/eyes could not focus before when her doctor put her on an antibiotic (unspecified). The patient was also very overweight. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN; lot: unknown, expiry: 28Jul2021) for attention deficit disorder and the patient takes a cocktail of anti-depressants (unspecified) for her depression. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 3 PM and by 5PM she was experiencing bad headache, fever, L arm (injection site) pain that was severe. Later that evening she had blurred double vision and couldn't function. She also got a fever of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, was dizzy and her eyes could not focus and were almost like double vision but not quite, it was hard to explain. She just remembered that she had a similar reaction with her eyes before, when her doctor put her on an antibiotic. She cannot recall what antibiotic that was. The patient also experienced dizziness on 11Jan2021. The patient treated her side effects with ibuprofen and most of these improved. The injection was given in her left arm, her non-dominate one. She says that the pain was so bad it woke her up, and she doesn't take any pain meds, but that was really bad. She says that she took some Ibuprofen (lot: P113671, exp: Jan2022), about a total of 800mg over a few hours. Her fever had started pretty fast, by 05:00PM on the 11th, and it was better after taking the Ibuprofen, as was her arm pain, and headache. She says that the dizziness went away probably around 02:00AM the following day (12Jan2021). She says her eyes can focus again as well. The patient thinks that these effects are medically significant, mostly that her eyes were not able to focus, it was very scary. The patient stated that the purpose of this call is to have this documented, and possibly find out if there are recommendations that she should not get the second dose, since she had to call out of work because she couldn't function. The outcome of the event ""blurred double vision and couldn't function; eyes wouldn't focus, couldn't function"" was recovered on an unspecified date and dizziness recovered on 12Jan2021 at 02:00. The outcome of the event ""she had to call out of work because she couldn't function"" was unknown while the other events were recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: The 56-year-old female patient had medical history included attention deficit disorder; hypothyroidism and depression and she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this. The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn't function/eyes could not focus. Based on information reported, the reported double vision and difficulty focusing eyes were more likely due to pre-existing condition (s); and less likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The rest events fever, headache, vaccination site pain and dizziness were likely causally related to the use of vaccine due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I've never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn't sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random.

I experienced no itching of hands or wrists. Approximately 53 hours after Dose #2: Small, painful red pustule-like occurrence on base of right thumb, with the appearance of a few small dots in it. I experienced no itching of  thumb or hand. These events both occurred within the same timeframe following the vaccine doses. Following the first event I was seen in the ER. I checked out fine and they could not say exactly what this was. They said it did not appear to be an allergic reaction to the vaccine because it was not systemic and I had no other symptoms such as trouble breathing. They thought perhaps it was coincidental...I work in the hospital as a radiologic technologist where I hand-wash and hand-sanitize all day. Perhaps I just over-washed that day? However I've worked there for 17 years and never had this happen. The redness and rash dissipated by end of day. Following the second  event I did not follow up with any medical provider. This pustule I got happened while I was at home, and otherwise I felt fine so I left it at that. It took several days for the pustule to  go away. I hope you don't mind but I am writing to report this information in the event it may be helpful to you and I am also reporting it because I want to know if what I experienced could be considered an immune response to the vaccine?
