He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient's Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.

0917513,01/02/2021,NY,41.0,41,,F,,"Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling ""fully recovered"" from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone.

The MA administered the injection and it felt strange. It didn't hurt, I felt a sensation that made me think that the fluid from the vaccine was pooling into my skin. When she pulled out the needle there was blood dripping down my arm (I have never bled from a vaccine before.) The MA apologized numerous times. In the next fifteen seconds the injection site swelled up into a lump that was at least 2 inches in height. The MA looked afraid, apologized more and said ""I have never seen this before. I am going to get a nurse."" The nurse came in and said she had never seen it before either so they got the doctor who said that she never has seen it before either. She asked me if I was having symptoms of anaphylaxis, which I was not. The MA explained ?I asked all the questions, I administered it like this, I pinched the skin like this?? and demonstrated to the doctor, who didn?t reply. The doctor said that she wanted me to sit for fifteen minutes to assure I am okay. The MA sat with me and apologized over and over again. The nurse got me an ice pack and the MA and nurse struggled to activate it by squeezing it, then handed it to me with a towel that made it so I couldn?t feel the cold. I took off the towel and put it on the lump. They didn?t bandage the injection site. I was in such a panic that I didn?t realize I was using an unsanitized ice pack on an open wound until I got home. The swelling had reached maximum at around 3 minutes after the injection, then started going down. After 15 minutes the swelling had reduced substantially, but was still swollen. They still looked panicked when I was leaving. I said that I?m going home to my mom who is an RN and that I have an epi pen which made their faces look relieved. I got home and my mom was horrified as she administers flu shots all the time with no reaction like that, ever. My mom thinks that MA didn?t administer it correctly, possibly it wasn?t given deep enough so it was into the subcutaneous fat or that it was in the wrong place on my arm which caused the bleeding. I feel like they were trying to hide that the MA made a mistake and it was not just a bad reaction to the vaccine. The MA apologized over and over again, probably ten times. The notes of my visit say that I had a reaction to the vaccine. I worry that it was administered incorrectly and they aren?t going to report the mistake, that?s why I feel it?s necessary for me to make the report. I still had noticeable swelling the next day, very sore arm and a bruise around the injection site.

Thought of going to ER, heart palpitations too. Increase in pain in arm. Up and down thru Friday night. Vomiting. Sat only low grade to no fever. Arm is now beyond painful. Even my shirt touching is torture, it is hot, red, swollen. Pain radiating all the way to fingertips. Had to draw a line on arm of redness outer boundary to see if it'd increase in size. Still nauseous almost all day had some dinner and living on freezer pops to keep food down. Took a benedryl before bed in case it's any allergic reaction. Headache and migraines throughout. Praying since they placed the shot so high it's not into bursa sack. I have rheumatoid arthritis and had shoulder bursitis In past. If they know giving too high is a problem then why on Earth do they? Woke up Sunday morning after another fitful pained night.

0918954,01/02/2021,OH,74.0,,,M,,"On 2/1/2020 I received my second shingrix shot. I was advised (as usual) that I would experience stiffness/soreness. However, within 24 hours I had sore throat and dry cough. On 2/2.2020 I began experiencing pain and stiffness in all muscles and joints which continued to get worse each day. On 2/21/2020 I went to my PCP since I could not raise my arms to shoulder height and had difficulty walking. I was put on a 12 day prednisone (40-30-20-10 mg) regimen. The pain was alleviated until the 10 mg does at which the pain and stiffness returned. On 3/12/2020 the PCP put me on a second course of prednisone (again 40-30-20-10 mg) and advised if it to worse I should see a rumatologist. I inquired if it could be Covid and should I be tested to which he said no. On 3/23/2020 I began experiencing a pronounced shortness of breath with rapid heart rate with minimal exertion (resting HR of 85 to exertion rate of 155-165). This concerned me since I am very active (having spend an average of 55 minutes a day exercise for 234 continuous days working out on various combination s of exercises on a treadmill, recumbent bike, rowing machine, soloflex, weights, and back exercises suggested for a bad back). When the shortness of breath made it difficult to exercise and having a third course of prednisone, I saw a rumitologist who advised I get heart tests and pulmonary function tests. He also kept me on a progressively reduced prednisone level to address polymyalgia rheumatica -- varying several times as symptoms would increase and decrease. In July, I did go for EKG, echocardiogram, chemical stress, and an imaging test -- which showed no problems with the heart. I again asked if this could be Covid, to which the heart Dr asked for an antibody test, which came up negative. Considering the length of time from initial symptoms and the potential for false testing along with the persistence of antibodies with extended time I accepted the results. i have also gone to a pulmonary physician and had x-rays, breathing tests, a 'sniff' test to fluoscopically scan lung function and in addition had sleep studies. Only thing determined was possible sleep apnea -- which I question since I get 8-9 hours sleep and am not napping the next day. Also, my wife says I do not stir at night. To date, I have maybe recovered about 10-20% of the breathing I lost and the heart rate is still high with minimal exertion. I can work out on the bike for limited time. My research on the internet led me determine that possibly the shingrix 'deactivated' virus caused a polymyalgia rheumatica response. As the prednisone was increased and extended over a long period of time literature shows that some people have a shortness of breath and increased heartrate response to the drug. Several of the doctors have doubted my analysis and said the symptoms were chance occurrences. As an R&D scientist/engineer in industry, I have learned there are essentially no coincidences in life or test results. I now still believe I had a reaction to the shingrix with a resultant response to the treatment with prednisone. Likewise, I have considered that I potentially had Covid and with early treatment with prednisone steroid I may have been put into a long haul status. To date, I have not been tested for Covid, and would wonder if residual virus could be detected in long haul persons. In any case, my life has been seriously affected with several thousands of dollars of testing saying I am healthy yet have these symptoms continuing. At my current prednisone reduction schedule, I should be off prednisone in July 2021. Even with reduced prednisone dosage changes, I've seen only marginal improvement in breathing/heart rate. When this began I was 73 years old and in my opinion I was physically in the mid 30 to mid 40's due to my exercise regimen.

I have continued to experience pain at the injection site on my left arm for eleven weeks. It is not constant, and not sharp, but is rather a dull ache that seems to be deep in the muscle or shoulder joint. It is a daily pain that is annoying and sometime lasts for quite a few minutes on end. Raising my arm seems to restart the pain at any time. To me, it feels like the same discomfort that normally lasts only two or three days after a normal vaccine shot.

As these are common side effects, I wasn't concerned. The symptoms - other than mild vertigo/dizziness - subsided by 10/13. The mild vertigo continued and mild left ear pain began on 10/14. Ear pain continued, and, believing it was (as is often the case) viral, I didn't go to urgent care until 10/19, as the pain had not resolved. I was diagnosed with a bacterial ear infection and given amoxycillin. On 10/20 I woke up with high-tone hearing loss in the left ear (I was unable to hear the beep of my phone alarm or determine the direction the sound was coming from) and tinnitus. I called the urgent care aftercare phone line and was prescribed a Medrol pack and Flonase. After I finished the Medrol pack, I still had hearing loss, though it was a little better, and I had some mild pain in my left ear and a feeling of fullness. So on 10/27 I saw an ENT. The ENT found no signs of infections, but the hearing test showed significant hearing loss in the left ear. He prescribed a 12-day course of high-dose prednisone to help reduce inflammation. I took 60 mg for 6 days, then tapered off. My follow-up hearing test showed only a very small improvement. At this point, the ENT sent me for blood work and an MRI. The bloodwork and the MRI were all normal. That was the end of treatment. I continue to have hearing loss and tinnitus in my left ear, as well as having bouts of dizziness if I move my head too quickly. I do not know that the Shingrix vaccine caused this hearing loss, but I've ultimately decided I should report my experience because of the timing of the two events was very close",,,,,,,,,,10/11/2020,10/20/2020,9,,UNK,,Lexapro (generic) 20mg/d; Singulair (generic) 10mg/d; mirtazapine (generic) 15mg/d; albuterol (generic) as needed (infrequently) Tylenol (as needed),"former smoker, former alcohol use; unilateral kidney agenesis (congenital)","asthma, depression/disthymic disorder, seasonal allergies",,,2,11/27/2020,,,,"pollen, grasses, ibuprofen, cats (contact allergy)"

Last year when I got the shot I was very sick with flu like symptoms in the day immediately following the injection and again approximately three weeks later. I also had the usual expected symptoms of soreness at the injection site and general tiredness. Last year the symptoms were bad enough that I had to curtail regular activities for three to four days. This year the same thing happened to both me and my wife (66 year old female). Neither of us were real sick after the shot but we were very sick for three or four days about three weeks out from the shot. I had the shot on October 5th and I have not felt well since that time. I'm concerned about either of us getting the flu shot next given the severity of the symptoms the last two year. I looked on line regarding issue but couldn't find any credible information regarding these kinds of side effects. Last year I suppose we could have just picked up a cold but this year we have been mostly limiting interactions and wearing masks so I am really concerned that this could be something to do with the vaccine.

Please provide final diagnosis (SAE verbatim) along with causality; Anaphylaxis 2. Was the events occurred due to flu vaccine ? Do you consider flu vaccine as co-suspect ? if yes plz provide details with causality: The study physician believes that once the participant's immune system was challenged with the flu vaccine, she started developing antibodies and therefore a cross reaction that ended up escalating to a strong reaction either to the flu vaccine itself or combination of her sensitivity to the NRTs and now her overactive immune system. 3. Provide other possible causes if any: Possible sensitivity to ""medicinal nicotine"" as it is purified and not mixed with tobacco as it is in the smoke of cigarettes, however the physician feels this is unlikely. Another possibility the physician noted is that the participant is sensitive to the vehicle in NRTs (matrix of lozenge, or the adhesive in the patch), but that she is not necessarily allergic to them as she had been on them in the past and even though she had a variety of reactions to different brands, she never had an anaphylactic reaction but rather minor local reactions. 4.

The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was 'hanging and drooping' and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.

Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter's prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED ""return immediately if"" parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as ""none"". Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn't speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020.

She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did.

Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) & 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), & 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable.

Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl.

After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had ""broke"" and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I'm usually at about 80).

The subject's concurrent conditions included anxiety, acid reflux and morning sickness. The subject's past medications included Bonjesta (doxylamine succinate, pyridoxine hydrochloride) for morning sickness, nexium and famotidine both for acid reflux. The subject's concomitant medications included Dexilant (dexlansoprazole), cimetidine and sucralfate for acid reflux, citalopram from anxiety, Phenergan (promethazine) and Zofran (ondansetron) for morning sickness and prenatal plus DHA (vitamins nos, docosahexaenoic acid) for pregnancy.  The subject's obstetrical history included one previous pregnancy with one full term live birth. The subject had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The subject had no maternal or paternal medical history with MCM. The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2020. The subject's estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 31-Mar-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 01-Apr-2021. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 25-Aug-2020, the ultrasound revealed no MCM.  On 02-Sep-2020, the counsyl chromosome 13, 18, 21 plus sex chromosome analysis and ultrasound revealed no MCM.  On 12-Oct-2020, at approximately 15 weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100253284.   On the same day, the maternal serum alpha fetoprotein screening (MSAFP/Serum marker) revealed borderline elevation for spina bifida and it was unknown if MCM was noted.  On 20-Oct-2020, the MSAFP/Serum marker - repeat revealed no MCM.  On 03-Nov-2020, the ultrasound revealed partial placenta praevia and fluid collection near left kidney related to baby.  On 01-Dec-2020, the ultrasound revealed MCM: lymphangioma of foetus.  The outcome of the event 'placenta praevia' was not reported.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The event of 'placenta praevia' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked with case 202008416, due to the corresponding baby case.  Additional information received from other health professional on 21-Dec-2020 with additional document received on 29-Dec-2020: Two additional lab tests added. Placenta praevia added as event and case was upgraded from non-serious to serious. Fluid collection near left kidney related to baby and lymphangioma noted as baby case opened.

The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/03/2021,01/03/2021,0,,PVT,,None,Positive COVID PCR rapid test,None,,,2,01/05/2021,,,,None

On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell's Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell's Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell's Palsy, Incomplete Bell's Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell's Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient's exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell's Palsy  01/02/21 1231",,,,,,,,,N,12/30/2020,01/01/2021,2,"CBC dif, Chem Profile normal except glucose 159 . MRI no stroke.

The mother stated her daughter was fussy that afternoon, on 16Dec2020, the mother had nursed before she left, say around 10:30 AM, and probably nursed her around 3 PM, afterwards, and the next time she nursed, she was fussy, by early afternoon/evening a couple hours after nursing, The fussiness was just that day and evening, and her daughter has the low grade fever that evening was 16Dec2020.

Medical history reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. During the administration the patient did experience some types of reaction where it wanted medical supervision. So, basically when he did got the injection he was waiting for his 15 minute prolapse. But within probably he would say 7 to 8 minutes he started to experiencing some numbness to his left ear and usually he thought it was secondary to the that he had (not clarified) but progressively it went down to his mandible, his face and his left  shoulder numbness and he was experiencing some numbness that radiate towards his fingertips only to the left side. At that time he waived to the Nurse to supervise and at that time he wait again and a Physician came over. He checked his pulse and noted that he had normal rhythm during the pulse check and at that time and he had Emergency medical technician (EMT) come over. The EMT checked his blood pressure he thought multiple times through the left and to the right brachial. He was having what they would consider a hypertensive crisis where systolic were in 170's, 180's, diastolic numbers were between like 120's and 130's and his heart rate was in 70's. So, initially it was not anxiety induced. But he do not have no blood pressure. They wanted he to go to the hospital to treat the hypertensive crisis that was in. The patient opted not to. So he went home in a quieter environment he did have a radial blood pressure cough that he had been checking his blood pressure rigorously, tried different techniques and now he was back to normal state to 120-130 systolic and his diastolic was 70-80. This instance was weird that he did not see as a part of one of the side effects listed with Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine. No treatment received for the events, because he had no history of hypertension it was just more of decreasing the ambient around he. At that time he wanted to go to a quiet environment, took a shower and check his blood pressure. He did orthostatic while laying down sitting up, standing up and he was not hypertensive.
