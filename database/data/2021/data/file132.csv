I took Tylenol and that dulled the pain, but I was still in pain. Joints achy and stiff. I kind of expected the achy joints - happened the first two COVID-19 shots. That morning, I tried to get ready for work - got slower and slower in movement and I had a whooshing sound in my ears. I felt very off. When I had woken up, initially, my eyelids hurt but by the time I got going in the morning, there was an intense throbbing behind my eyes. It felt like I was walking through quicksand. Everything (all symptoms) got worse throughout the day. The injection site felt very bruised, and it still does. That's completely normal for me compared with the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was not redness or swelling this time but just bruised. Yesterday, I got random sharp jabbing pains through various parts of my body; kind of like a shock or a pinched nerve feel. I felt queasy; I had three bouts of diarrhea and a lot of gurgling in my stomach after the diarrhea. From 02:30 - 09:00PM I was ""dead to the world,"" and woke up with intense pain from head to toe. I was disoriented and I thought it was 03:00 in the morning. I texted my daughter to bring the thermometer as I felt chilled and clammy. Fever was 103. 6. My chest was very heavy and tight. I didn't feel like I was wheezing or having trouble breathing but it was concerning to have the heaviness and tightness. I called my primary care doctor. On-call doctor told me to go to ER - since symptoms had worsening it was over 24 hours since vaccine. They tested me for COVID-19 at ER. They gave me Tylenol and IV (Ibuprofen in an IV). And it all dulled the pain, but the pain has still persisted. The fever goes down when I take Tylenol but then it goes back up but only up to 101. It was 99 something this morning but it's 101 around 01:00 or 2:00 today but it's gone back down again. Last night, not moving, my pain was 7 or 8. That was just sitting completely still. If I tried to move the pain was excruciating - it was hard to walk. Right now, the whooshing noise has decreased in my ears; the pain has decreased in joints - still stiff but I can move them. I don't feel so disoriented. They said to come back in tonight if I'm not significantly improved. The pain is still definitely there, and the fever is there but not as bad. They said about 20% of people will have a reaction to this extent for the booster. Blood pressure was significantly low when they took it at ER - 85/58 (my normal reading is 115-120/90). Treatment - stay in bed; Tylenol every six hours. Just before they discharged me this morning, at ER, my hands and feet felt very compressed; like they are being smashed between boards. That was consistent pain for about two hours and when I got home and went to sleep and woke up it wasn't quite as bad. Still stiff though. There's a lot of fatigue. It takes a lot of effort just to have energy to get up and go to the bathroom. I don't feel like I'm passing out, but I just feel like I have to walk slowly to keep my balance because my leg joints and my feet are so stiff that trying to get them to move is a challenge; I haven't felt like I was in danger of collapsing though or that I was going to pass out. The pain was enough to make me cry. I can't believe I'm feeling this bad and that I'm not sick. Two months prior to this, I got the flu vaccine. I think it was on September 2, 2021.

She reports that the pain began immediately while receiving the Flu vaccine in office on 10/12/21. She states that she received the Pneumonia vaccine in the same arm on the same day, which was not painful for her. The Pneumonia shot was given in the lower deltoid and the flu shot was given at the upper deltoid. Patient reports feeling acute pain at the site of injection as the vaccine was being administered. She states that the pain has been constant, has not improved, and is getting worse. It is especially uncomfortable with movement and ADLs, such as: driving, getting dressed, showering, etc. She reports a history of shoulder joint laxity and dislocations in childhood (pt unsure of which shoulder), but states neither shoulder has fully dislocated since middle school when she was playing soccer. She reports that she had extensive PT to both shoulders following the dislocation. She denies experiencing a pain like this in the past, and has not had a similar reaction with previous vaccines. She endorses increased pain with movement and rates it as a 6/10 today. With rest, it is manageable at a 1/10. She denies any bruising, rash, swelling, or pruritis to the injection site/left shoulder. She describes the pain as muscle aches and burning to her left shoulder joint and left arm. She states that it is rare, but occasionally the pain will radiate down to her left wrist. She denies any numbness or tingling in her upper extremities. She denies any recent heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, or falls/trauma. She moved roughly 1 week ago, but states that her mom did the heavy lifting for her d/t discomfort. For pain management, she has been taking 2-3 Advil 200 mg while at work. She states that it helps alleviate some of the pain, but it never completely resolves, just feels more ""dull"".

So, in a matter of 1 month, I had developed a blood clot, took medications for it, and it was completely gone by August 4 or 5th.

I did have fatigue and that just kicked in last week and I've been struggling ever since probably Thursday or Friday last week and when I did a Teladoc visit on Monday she wanted me to go straight to the ER, but I can't keep taking time off work. I did take 1/2 a day off today to try and get everything situated before I go to the ER and get tested for COVID-19. When I got diagnosed with my DVT Dr. thinks it was from the drive, but this drive wasn't new to me and I don't think that's what it was from, and the ER nurse thought it was from the vaccine. Around the same time of trop (first part of July) I was supposed to start my cycle and 2-3 days later I started cramping like it was about to start over and it was gut wrenching cramps I've never had before. The Teladoc told me to go t ER again because she thought I was pregnant and had a tubal pregnancy, so I went to the ER, and I had every type of ultrasound possible and wasn't pregnant. They couldn't find out why I was having these issues. 4 days before I ended up in the ER for DVT at this time I had uterine bleeding and I thought I had a pulled muscle, so I didn't mention it to the ER staff. Right now, I'm dealing with the breathing difficulties, shortness of breath, coughing fits, and fatigue. With the fatigue I haven't regained my full energy back since.

I have been using a water flosser for many years without  any adverse side effects. .  I also noticed that my gums were sloughing skin on the right  side of my mouth.  I brushed it off as  having burned my mouth. As I had been healthy my  entire life, I treated this oral pain with OTC medication and stopped using the water flosser.   I assumed that this would heal on its own and did not really worry about it.   But a few weeks   later the sloughing moved to the left side of my mouth.  In August I finally managed to get  an appointment with my dentist.  He said he did not know what was causing this issue and told me to see a periodontist.  I saw a periodontist on Aug 30 who said I had Lichen Planus infection, and he performed a biopsy to verify.  On Sept 22 he called me with the results of the biopsy, diagnosing Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid.  My primary care physician told me to see  an ophthalmologist and a dermatologist.  The dermatologist took a biopsy with the same results.  As of now the only symptoms are oral.  This is a rare auto immune disease that is chronic and progressive. Below is information I got  Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid  General Discussion Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a group of rare chronic autoimmune disorders characterized by blistering lesions that primarily affect the various mucous membranes of the body. The mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes are most often affected. The mucous membranes of the nose, throat, genitalia, and anus may also be affected. The symptoms of MMP vary among affected individuals depending upon the specific site(s) involved and the progression of the disease. Blistering lesions eventually heal, sometimes with scarring. Progressive scarring may potentially lead to serious complications affecting the eyes and throat. In some cases, blistering lesions also form on the skin, especially in the head and neck area. The exact cause of MMP is unknown.  MMP has been known by many different names within the medical literature including benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, cicatricial (scarring) pemphigoid, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. In March of 2002, a consensus group of researchers determined that mucous membrane pemphigoid was the best designation for this group of disorders. The term ""benign"" mucous membrane pemphigoid was deemed inappropriate because of the potential for serious complications in some cases. The term ""cicatricial"" pemphigoid excluded affected individuals who do not develop scarring. Site-specific terms such as ""ocular"" cicatricial pemphigoid excluded individuals with multiple site involvement.  Signs & Symptoms MMP is characterized by the development of recurring blistering skin lesions affecting the mucous membranes of the body. These lesions may result in scarring of the affected area. Specific symptoms and severity vary from person to person depending upon the specific site(s) involved. It is important to note that affected individuals, in most cases, will not have all of the symptoms listed below.  The mucous membranes lining the mouth and eyes are most commonly affected. In some cases, the first sign of MMP is a red and blistered mouth. The gums (gingivae), roof of the mouth (palate), and the mucous membrane lining the inner cheek (buccal mucosa) may be affected. Involvement of the gums usually results in very red, tender gums that bleed easily and tend to slough off in shreds or sheets. Blistering lesions may spread to affect the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) as well as the voice box (larynx) potentially resulting in difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and hoarseness. After these lesions heal, progressive scarring may occur, resulting in serious complications including narrowing (stenosis) of the esophagus and/or the larynx. In addition, the opening between the vocal cords (supraglottic region) may also narrow (supraglottic stenosis). In rare severe cases, such symptoms can ultimately result in life-threatening complications such as asphyxiation (breathing is cut off).  In many cases of MMP, the mucous membranes lining the eyes (conjunctiva) may be involved. Inflammation of conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) or erosions forming on the conjunctiva may be the initial signs of ocular involvement in MMP. Involvement of the eyes may not be obvious at first, however, and only a special examination by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) can detect the earliest scarring that develops just beneath the conjunctiva. In most cases, one eye is involved first and the second eye becomes involved later, usually with two years. Ocular symptoms may include pain or grittiness of the eye, increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma), abnormal inward turning of the eyelid (entropion), and abnormal inward turning of the eyelashes (trichiasis) potentially causing irritation of the eyeball. Adhesions may form between the eyelids (symblepharon) or between the eyelid and the eye itself. In some cases, MMP may progress to cause clouding (opacity) of the corneas, loss of vision and, potentially, blindness.  In some cases, affected individuals may develop blistering lesions affecting only the eyes or the mouth, with no involvement of other mucosal sites. Scarring occurs with less frequency in cases of MMP that only involve the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral mucosa). Additional sites where lesions may form include mucous membranes of the nose, genitalia, and anus. Pain, bleeding and scarring may occur at these sites. Urinary and sexual dysfunction may result secondary to genital involvement.  In approximately 20-30 percent of cases, the skin may become involved. In these patients, the skin of the head and neck is usually affected. Skin lesions may be either fluid-filled blisters (bullous) or reddish (erythematous) plaques, which may bleed or itch. Eventually they scar upon healing. Scarring may result in areas of discoloration of the skin (known as hyperpigmentation when it is darkened patches and hypopigmentation when it is light patches). Involvement of the scalp may lead to patchy areas of hair loss (alopecia).  MMP usually has a long duration with frequent remissions and recurrence.  Causes The exact cause of mucous membrane pemphigoid is unknown. MMP is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body's natural defenses (antibodies or immunoglobulins) against ""foreign"" or invading organisms (antigens) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. The term autoantibody is used to describe antibodies that are created to attack healthy tissue. The term autoantigen (""self"" antigen) is used to describe the normal tissues and cells of the body that are targeted by the autoantibodies.  In patients who have MMP, autoantibodies are being produced that attack the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of the epithelium. The BMZ can be thought of as a sort of ""glue"" that holds the outer layer of skin (epidermis or oral epithelium) onto the underlying tissues. Once this glue is attacked and destroyed by the autoantibodies, the skin is no longer tacked down, allowing it to lift off and produce blisters.  Researchers believe that in some cases affected individuals may have a genetic susceptibility to developing some forms of MMP. In these cases several factors may contribute to the development of the disorder including immunological, genetic, environmental, and/or other factors. !!!!!!NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON IN MY GENETIC HISTORY, NEITHER MATERNAL OR PATERNAL HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AN AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE!!!!!!  In a very small number of patients, MMP may be caused by the use of certain prescription drugs. Skin lesions associated with some cases of MMP may appear following trauma to the affected area. Some cases of MMP affecting the eyes may become apparent after eye (ocular) surgery such as cataract removal.  Affected Populations Mucous membrane pemphigoid is a rare group of autoimmune blistering disorders that affects females twice as often as males. The average age of onset of MMP is during the seventh decade (60 to 70 years of age). However, the disorder can occur at any age. The exact incidence of MMP is unknown. Because the disorder is difficult to identify, many researchers believe it is under-diagnosed.  AS  UP CAN SEE, THIS IS A SERIOUS DISEASE WITH DEVESTATING SYMPTOMS.  I HAVE NO HISTORY THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THIS DISEASE OTHER THAN THE CO VID VACCINE THAT PRODUCES ANTIBODIES IN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM.

I additionally felt weak, fatigued and had terrible restless legs. During the fourth week after the vaccine, I began to lose balance and could not stand without holding onto something. I also lost strength and coordination in my right leg. My gait was not normal, and I could only take small steps. I was so fatigued that I could hardly do anything for myself. My body was completely weak, and my right side was partially paralyzed.  Treatment: After initially seeing a doctor, I was immediately sent to a neurologist, and I remain under care of a neurologist to this day.

The patient was born via donor embryo to a 46-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with pre�B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia during her 18th week of pregnancy. The mother received 3 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, and 5 cycles of rituximab. A bone marrow biopsy at 21 weeks gestation demonstrated leukemia remission. The last chemotherapy cycle was completed by 28 weeks, the last dose of rituximab was completed at 27 weeks. The mother had complete blood count recovery before the planned cesarean section at 30 weeks gestational age. The newborn patient had a relatively uncomplicated neonatal intensive care unit course, she did not require intubation or ventilator support, and was able to be discharged by 7 weeks of life. The infant did not receive maternal breast milk to minimize any potential for further rituximab exposure. Her complete blood count (CBC) at delivery was within normal limits: white blood cell count 12.1�10^3/mcL, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 1600/mcL (normal 29 to 31 weeks gestational age ALC: 3219/mcL [800 to 5800]), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 9922/mcL (normal 29 to 31 wk gestational age ANC: 12000/mcL [7800 to 14500]), hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL, and platelets 447�10^3/mcL. Despite this severe lymphopenia, a repeat CBC on day of life 2 revealed improved ALC of 2530 mcL. She received 1 red blood cell transfusion for a drop in hemoglobin to 9.8 g/dL at day 3 of life. The infant had 2 normal newborn screens.   On unknown dates, she was vaccinated with haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate)(manufacturer unknown) and pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis (dose #, exact doses, routes, anatomical locations, lot # and expiration dates were not reported). Other vaccines included: tetanus, hepatitis B, polio strain 1 and diphtheria.  At 10 weeks of life during a scheduled follow-up, the patient was found to be severely neutropenic with an ANC of 0 in addition to severe hypogammaglobulinemia with immunoglobulin (Ig)G of 62mg/dL (normal: 206 to 601; 95% confidence interval, for age 2mo). Because of fever following her 2 months immunizations, the patient was admitted and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)�2 doses which resulted in the improvement of her ANC to 528. A neutrophil antibody screening test was not done at this time but based on improvement of ANC following IVIG infusion. With concern for recurrent neutropenia, the decision was made to give her intermittent granulocyte colony stimulation factor 5mcg/kg with gradual return of her ANC to normal levels without granulocyte colony stimulation factor by 9 months of age, where it has remained. However, the patient has continued to have severe hypogammaglobulinemia requiring IVIG every 4 to 8 weeks to maintain IgG> 400 mg/dL. At 10 months of life she demonstrated improvement in IgM levels but continued to have a severe deficiency in IgG and IgA. Lymphocyte subset analysis by flow cytometry at 10 and 15 months of age demonstrated a grossly normal number of B cells: 1410 and 1797 cells/�L, respectfully (normal range of 600 to 2700 cells/�L); her IgM levels were close to normal at 10 months (patient: 30 mg/dL, normal 82 mg/dL (41 to 149 mg/dL) and in the normal range at 15 months of age (patient: 61 mg/dL, normal 93 mg/dL [43 to 173 mg/dL]); however, she remains profoundly deficient in IgG with nadirs below 300. At 19 months of age, further evaluation by flow cytometry revealed this B-cell population consisted of IgM-only memory B cells, with no evidence of the next stage in development of the B cell to an IgG antibody secreting, class switched B cell. Repeat B-cell phenotyping at 24 months of age continued to demonstrate a complete absence of class switched B cells and the patient remains on IVIG infusions to maintain IgG levels >400 mg/dL. The patient is currently 4 years of age. Attempts at weaning off the IVIG have failed thus far. Spacing IVIG to 6-week intervals (~2 half lifes) resulted in IgG levels <300 mg/dL (normal, 728 mg/dL [441 to 1135 mg/dL]) and a recurrent stye. Given her frequent IVIG infusions, it is difficult to interpret vaccine response, the patient has demonstrated variable response to protein antigen vaccines. She had potential positive response to tetanus, hepatitis B, polio strain 1 vaccines, with unknown longevity of the response. She had negative IgG titers to diphtheria and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine suggesting that positive antibody titers to other vaccines may not be real. Remarkably, the patient has had few infections despite her immunologic dysfunction. The outcome of the event was unknown. Multiple attempts at giving the patient other vaccines such as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine combined with spreading IVIG out up to 3 months did not result in any functional IgG production again pneumococcus suggesting continued immune dysregulation in this patient.

Several times I would wake up in the middle of the night tingling all over and would not be able to go back to sleep - it was terrifying to feel like your body is attacking itself. Over the course of several months, I had extensive blood work done, an EKG heart stress test, and an MRI of my brain and spine along with numerous phone and in-person appointments with multiple general practitioners, specialists, physical therapists, and a psychologist.  ALL of them said everything looked fine and on paper, I am perfectly healthy with no explanation for my symptoms. Eventually, after months, the symptoms began to fade. The tingling left first and then the chest pain - although I do occasionally still feel it but much less intense. It is like waves come and go with each wave lasting less time and being less intense. I can only hope that eventually it will go away and I will not feel like this anymore.

Initial reports of anaphylaxis after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer Inc, vaccine suggested a case rate of 11.1 per million doses, but subsequent reports estimate a rate of 5 per million doses). In a recent description of 21 anaphylaxis cases after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, there were no biphasic reactions. We present the case of an individual who experienced suspected biphasic anaphylaxis after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine.  A 42-year-old female nurse with depression and anxiety treated with bupropion but no previous atopic history or anaphylaxis presented for her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a nurse and paramedic staffed employee vaccination clinic in a major hospital. After 10 minutes from vaccination, she developed facial angioedema noted by multiple medical providers, sensation of throat closure, hoarse voice, and a pruritic rash on her neck and upper chest with no substantial injection site reaction. At the vaccination site, she was treated with oral diphenhydramine and 0.3 mg intramuscular epinephrine with symptom improvement. She was transported to the emergency department, where she had a heart rate of 108 bpm and blood pressure of 137/87 mm Hg. She was treated with 20 mg intravenous famotidine and 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone and observed for 6 hours without symptom recurrence. A tryptase drawn 90 minutes after symptom onset was elevated at 12.5 ng/mL (<11.5 ng/mL). She was discharged with an epinephrine autoinjector and initially did well, but the following evening (30 hours postvaccination), she developed recurrent tongue swelling (noted by husband), sensation of throat closing, eye puffiness, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness. She administered oral diphenhydramine and her epinephrine autoinjector with rapid improvement in her symptoms. She went back to the emergency department where providers noted resolution of tongue swelling but persistent periorbital edema. There was no rash. Her heart rate was 109 bpm, and her blood pressure was 121/ 74 mm Hg. She was treated with 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone, observed for 4 hours, and discharged with no subsequent symptom recurrence. She was evaluated in an allergy clinic 3 weeks after her reaction. Further history revealed previous tolerance of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-containing medications (MiraLAX). She had no known drug allergies or dermal fillers. Because of her marked systemic reaction, she underwent expanded skin testing.4 Testing results to PEG, methylprednisolone sodium, methylprednisolone acetate, and polysorbate 20 were negative. Skin testing result to triamcinolone acetonide (containing polysorbate 80) was negative with a 40 mg/mL skin prick and 1:100 and 1:10 intradermals but result to a 1:1 intradermal was positive (Table 1). Additional testing results were positive to Refresh sterile eye drops (Allergan), negative to Prevnar-13 (both containing polysorbate 80), and negative to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Table 1). A baseline serum tryptase was persistently elevated at 12.8 ng/mL, although spot urine measurements of mast cell mediators (leukotriene E4, 2,3-dinor-11beta-prostaglandin F2 alpha, and N-methylhistamine) were normal. KIT D816V mutation testing result on peripheral blood was negative but testing result for hereditary alpha tryptasemia was positive with an extra alpha tryptase copy number. She is avoiding the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine until an in-office challenge is performed. Several aspects of this case deserve discussion. Biphasic anaphylaxis is well described but uncommon, occurring in approximately 3% of adults who develop anaphylaxis. Risk factors for a biphasic reaction include previous anaphylaxis, unknown trigger, and delayed epinephrine administration, although these are variable among different study populations. In adults, the estimated median time from exposure to the biphasic reaction is 15 hours. Our case is unique in the fact that the patient had a biphasic reaction despite no history of allergy and prompt receipt of epinephrine during the initial reaction, although some symptoms may have been anxiety related. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of suspected biphasic anaphylaxis to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Another interesting aspect is the positive polysorbate 80 skin test result. Polysorbate 80 is a large nonionic compound that is a widely used excipient in many oral and injectable medications, including the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, but is not present in the messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines. It is cross-reactive with PEG, another excipient thought to be the leading culprit in allergic reactions to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Immunoglobulin E and non-immunoglobulin E-mediated mechanisms are implicated in polysorbate and PEG reactions. Expert opinion suggests an algorithm using nonirritating concentrations for PEG and polysorbate testing in the evaluation of patients with possible anaphylaxis to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. There has only been 1 report of immediate hypersensitivity from a polysorbate 80-containing vaccine (Gardasil) with positive results to skin prick and intradermal testing to this vaccine 8. It is plausible that our patient's reaction to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the result of PEG and polysorbate 80 cross-reactivity, which has been previously reported, albeit in patients with a positive PEG skin testing result. Our patient's negative results to PEG and methylprednisolone skin tests may suggest against cross-reactivity, although an alternative explanation is that the PEG concentration used for skin testing was too low to elicit a positive reaction. Owing to institutional restrictions, intradermal testing to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was unable to be performed, which would be the next step in evaluation. In addition, use of Refresh is non-standardized and based on expert opinion without established nonirritating concentrations. The sensitivity and specificity of skin testing to the vaccine and its components are unknown as is the mechanism of reaction. More patients will have to be evaluated to elucidate this further. A final interesting point is the patient's persistent tryptase elevation 3 weeks after her index reaction. Systemic mastocytosis and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome were deemed less likely after her negative KIT mutation testing result. Nevertheless, genetic testing result for hereditary alpha tryptasemia was positive and may have contributed to her symptoms given its association with elevated basal serum tryptase and increased risk of severe anaphylaxis. Despite this case report, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 will far outweigh the risk associated with vaccination. Although more study is needed to determine the use of skin testing in the evaluation of vaccine reactions, the widespread vaccination of the global population is imperative in the control of the pandemic.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information in the case, a contributory effect of the vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be ruled out. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

The patient stated, ""I had my first vaccine 43 days ago, today is the 43rd day and I knew that I could wait 21 to 42 days so I was kindly doing that because I had an immediate reaction not a severe reaction but an immediate one with my first vaccine at a clinic. They gave me the shot and I stood up and took two steps and right away was going on and I have COP disease (further not clarified) which is an extremely rare and incurable disease and I am not like much people. Out of 200 thousand, I have that disease. I am one percent of those, I have full body, so upper and lower extremities have COP on it. So, it's already diseased. But it did not really seem to affect me too much in the store the other day, I had a lot of swelling afterwards and of course I went into a flare because of the injection but I have those that happens to me. But the day I had those injections injection, like I said, I stood up and took two steps, it was swelling at the injection site already noticed and then soon to follow my lower arm, so step up in the injection site my lower arm now begins to swell and then my hand swells and my whole arm was stiff and it was for about two days. So, the original pharmacy has turned me down, saying they have never seen such a reaction or occurred a reaction like that. So, they are uncomfortable with giving me the second vaccine and then they said they had a stand-in pharmacy coming in for a day and they will surely give it to me. Now, they turned me down today too. Actually, two pharmacists turned me down today. They said that if I started to swell or had trouble breathing or notice any signs of that, they don't have a bed, they could lay me down and they don't have anyone who can keep an eye on me and because they are so busy with their job and I do, one of the promise of my disease, one of the most that I have is I swell all over and even this past week my chest has been swollen because I bathed the dog, that is all I did. But I bathed the dog and my chest swell, giving me a hard time breathing, specially in the evening as my symptoms get with my disease. I am just trying to figure out if this reaction is further, is it safe for me to get? I just got to find somebody. There is no way to get a bed and a vaccine shot in my area, the places that operate are just like that and I had Epipens, but they are expired. My mom is going to write it down for me, she helps me because I have some brain damage from this disease so she is going to help me."" No lab tests.

The patient had regular influenza shots, annually for many years with no problems.  On 22-Oct-2020, the patient was vaccinated with Fluad Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine, inactivated influenza virus surface antigen (subunit), egg-derived, mf59; dose reported as one, route of administration: intramuscular, anatomical location: right arm; indication: not reported). The batch number reported was 279813.  On the same day, within ten seconds after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, the patient felt discomfort in right lower back, which quickly became more severe with spasms which were not external muscles but internal. Spasms became very rapid and severe with shooting staightline pain from right of spinal cord (reported as ''spinal chord''), horizontally across back and spasming area. Spasms and pain moved up back to waist, then moved to front, and continued up abdominal area stopping at rib cage. The patient went to emergency department (ED). Upon arrival, spasms and pain continued subsiding after about 45 minutes. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed and the patient was monitored for vitals, with no unusual result and computerised tomogram (CT) abdomen revealed nothing unusual except for cyst on ovary. The patient did not receive any medications in ED and was discharged with no further events. Additionally, the patient visited physician's office and her doctor recommended no more quadrivalent.   On the same day, the patient recovered from all events, except from the event of 'cystic ovary' for which the outcome was not reported.   The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.

My body temperature reached 99.6 F which is high for me because I tend to be cold. The symptoms continued through the next day 10/30. I would get up out of bed to use the restroom or make myself something to eat, and I felt very dizzy and weak legged. I was bed ridden the entire day on 10/30. 10/31, I had started to feel better, but also had chest pain that started. After a couple hours, it would go away and come back for a couple hours and then go away. By 11/1, I woke up at 4:00am with severe chest pain. This time it wouldn?t go away like normal. I called my doctor and got in to see her for an appointment at 10:00am. Still the chest pain was there. My temperature was 99.1F by then. I was so fatigued. It was worse than having actual COVID-19 which I had in December 2020. I had an EKG done which came back normal. My doctor wrote me out from work for the week, and I worked from home as I could. I was so exhausted and tired all the time.  By Thursday, 11/5, the chest pain had gone away along with the other symptoms except for fatigue. On Friday, 11/6 left the house to go grocery shopping. After 1 hour, I was exhausted. I came home around 12:00pm and had a migraine headache set in. One of the worst I?ve had in my life. The migraine had lasted the rest of that day and all through 11/7. Around 1:00pm on Friday 11/5 I started my menstrual cycle which was 3 days early for me. It was light and spotty. That?s not normal for me to be early or for it to be just spotty. Around 4:00am I woke up to a extreme menstrual bleeding. I hopped out of bed and blood had soaked through my entire super heavy overnight pad and was running down both sides of my legs. I?ve never had such severe bleeding in my life. My migraine headache had moved to the right side temple of my head and was pounding. Around 9:00am 11/6 I had nausea and the chills all over again like the day right after I had received the 2nd dose. Around 6:00pm, my migraine had subsided. My body aches and chills are gone.

I could hardly stand, and my vision was blurred. The body pains went beyond the normal muscle aches and pains that may occur with fever (I have had several cases of pneumonia, and scarlet fever once in my life).

I almost went to the emergency room, but did not have health insurance at the time, and was concerned about the financial burden.  To help with my symptoms, I took an NSAID to help relieve symptoms, but the pain and high fever continued the next few days. Eventually, the symptoms resolved the following week, but not without increased long-term inflammation and pain in my joints, hips, etc. I often experience an elevated body temperature (not quite a fever, though), and I currently take some herbal anti-inflammatories to help with the inflammation.

1849546,11/07/2021,CA,28.0,28,,M,,"On May 7th, 10 hours after receiving my second Pfizer dose, at 12:40am, I started to experience bouts of muscle weakness and limb paralysis. By around 2:00am on Saturday, May 8th, I was fully paralyzed and unable to move or speak for at least 5 minutes. After regaining some movement and speaking ability, I yelled my wife?s name who immediately called 911 where I was transported to ED.  While in the ED on Saturday, May 8th, I received a full blood panel, urine analysis, CT with contrast, EKG, and neurology consultation to rule out possible TIA and CVA. All tests came back within normal limits and unremarkable.   During my CT scan, I began to experience a new episode of paralysis, lasting more than 20 minutes, that resulted in dyspnea. I am not claustrophobic and have never experienced dyspnea. After the scan, I was administered supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. My O2 SAT was in the high 90s for the majority of the morning. From 4:00 to 5:00am on Saturday, May 8th, my O2 SAT dropped to the low 80 range several times, but was able to regain normal O2 SAT. Around 6:00am, I recovered with no paralysis episodes and was monitored until 11:30am when I was discharged from the ED.  I was brought home and was functioning normally with no paralysis episodes for ~28 hours, until Sunday, May 9th at 9:30am, where I had another episode of full body paralysis with no dyspnea, in which paramedics took me back to the ED. At this visit, I had an MRI, which came back normal, and an EEG with a different neurologist. The results of the EEG were normal, even during these paralytic episodes, in which I had 3 during the EEG test.  I was admitted to the hospital Monday, May 10th for further observation and evaluation for at least the next two nights. My medical team consisted of a psychiatrist, neurologist, and generalist. I received his final diagnostic test of a lumbar puncture Tuesday, May 11th in the afternoon, which also came back unremarkable and within normal limits.  It is to note that these episodes of partial and full body paralysis come and go, sometimes at intervals of 30 seconds to as long as 25 minutes. During the episodes, I am unresponsive, but am able to breathe as well as cognitively alert with unimpaired memory. I can recall everything that has happened to me and I regain full function, motor and speech abilities once the episode passes.  After discharge on May 11th, I had no episodes until Wednesday June 11th late morning where I had another episode during a work video meeting. My wife called 911 and I was admitted to the hospital and observed until June 22nd. It is during this admission that another neurologist evaluated my episodes and diagnosed me with Functional Neurological Disorder.   Since June 22nd, I have had spouts of paralysis episodes here and there, latest episode being November 7th at 10:45pm. These episodes are inconsistent with unknown causes or triggers. It is to note that prior to getting the second Pfizer vaccine, my medical history was unremarkable as I am a healthy 29 year old who exercises regularly, eats well, and doesn?t smoke nor drink.

Patient was admitted for elevated oxygen requirements and had a few episodes of hypoxia dropping into 87%, usually overnight. However this was determined to be 2/2 to not being on a CPAP machine and during periods of exertion. His saturations improved considerably afterwards and he continued to saturate in the mid to low 90s on room air. After two days of improved oxygen saturations, it was determined the patient would be best served by the COVID at home program.

She fell and laid on the floor with her head on the corner of a dresser drawer until 8am on 11/6 when her niece that she lives with found her. Patient had slight standing issues (tried a few times to stand due to muscular soreness and weakness in legs) since shortly after her first Moderna shot on 2/11/21 at Pharmacy. Her 2nd dose was on 3/11/21 same place. Standing became increasingly harder but she was able to stand on her own then walk fine with no assistance anytime. Less than 24 hours after her booster we found her on the floor, unable to stan unable to stand on her own and with much muscular pain in her legs and back. We called 911 & went to Hospital around 8am on 11/6/21. They did a CAT scan to rule out stroke & bloodwork. She was discharged with a walker around 2pm same day. Doctors suspected covid booster shot reactions and said they were seeing many patients with covid shot reactions.  Patient was unable to stand at all, even with 3 adults trying to get her up and she was still having muscular pain. She stared and did not act right. The top of her thigh and hip area were extremely swollen. We called 911 again around 10pm on 11/6/21 to return to same hospital because she was totally immobile, unable to stand and barely walk even with a walker. A hip xray, covid test, more bloodwork and ultrasound were done - all negative. Doctors suspect Moderna booster reaction. She will be receiving physical therapy, IV antibiotics (slightly elevated white count) and oral Ibuprofin for inflammation. On 11/7 she was doing better.

1850349,11/08/2021,MA,61.0,61,,F,,"I received my second Moderna Covid-19 vaccine shot on March 28, 2021.  The shot was injected high up on my arm at the curve of my shoulder.  Approximately 3 hours later, while sitting on my couch watching television, I began to experience significant pain in my upper left arm, shoulder and, to a lesser degree, my forearm just below the elbow.  The pain was so severe, I could not lift my arm without assistance from my opposite hand.  The severe pain lasted about 3 days, then began to slightly subside.  The pain leveled out at approximately a 6-7 out of ten, about 4-5 days post injection.   After about 9-10 days, I made an appointment with my PCP and after a week or two of taking Ibuprofen with little to no improvement, I requested physical therapy.  I began my course of PT on April 19, 2021.  At my first visit, I explained my symptoms to my physical therapist and he asked me if I had ever heard of SIRVA.  It was his opinion that I had absolutely suffered an injury from the injection and diagnosed me with SIRVA.  I have now been treating for over 6 months and although I have had some improvement, I often regress for several days to weeks at a time when trying to add exercises that involve even the slightest amount of weight; i.e., 1-2 pounds.  In addition, one area of my upper arm continues to experience significant pain with certain movements and I can still experience levels of pain ranging from 4-7, depending on the movement.  I also saw a physiatrist on May 24, 2021 who, upon examination, advised me that I was presenting with symptoms of a rotator cuff injury.  My physical therapist and I have discussed the possible need for an MRI at this time.  On October 5, 2021, I had an MRI of my left shoulder which revealed:  1) Moderate anterosuperior rotator cuff tendinosis with high-grade undersurface tearing of the supraspinatus tendon extending into the anterior fibers of the infraspinatus tendon, as described.  2) Moderate acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis and mild subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis. 3) Small subacromial spur. 4) Thickened edematous inferior joint capsule, and infiltration and edema within the rotator interval fate, findings that can be seen in adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder).  On October 28, 2021, I followed up with an orthopedic surgeon.  After physical examination and reviewing the results of the MRI, it was his opinion that my frozen shoulder was the main cause of the pain, reduced range of motion and reduced strength I am experiencing.  I received a cortisone shot in my shoulder and it was his hope that my symptoms would subside; however, he advised that he expected my recovery time to be between 18 months and 2 years.  At this time, I continue to have reduced range of motion, reduced strength and pain with certain movements of my left arm.  I also experience achiness and/or pain at rest on occasion.  I am still unable to extend my left arm straight up over my head, the elbow remains somewhat bent and my right arm extends approximately 3 inches above my left.  I cannot reach straight out to the side and lift my arm, with or without holding anything.  I am also unable to reach behind me to retrieve an item, nor am I able to reach behind my back to adjust clothing or scratch my back.  I am also restricted from laying on my stomach and being able to place my left arm straight, extending above my head (as in yoga's child pose), or extend it straight out to the side.  All of these motions cause pain, sometimes significant, and discomfort.  Although the doctor is hopeful for full recovery, due to my slow progress and many regressions, I am not totally convinced that this will be the case.  It is my understanding that at times, this type of injury does not fully resolve.  Only time will tell.  I am currently continuing with a home exercise program and following up with my physical therapist on a monthly basis.",,,,,,,,,N,03/28/2021,03/28/2021,0,X-Rays - No significant findings MRI - 10/5/21 (See response to no. 18),PUB,,"Atorvastatin, Atenolol, Pantroprazole, baby aspirin, multi-vit",Acid reflux,"CAD, SVT",,,2,11/08/2021,,,,Seasonal/Environmental

He felt almost fully recovered, was doing work around the house, cooking meals and improving however last week he had a week of feeling more sleepy, eating less and his wife said sleeping 16 hours at times. He developed acute nausea with diaphoresis and chills and word finding issues the morning of his admit. He presented with a WBC and CSF revealed a pleocytosis. Workup was unremarkable-both cultures and images and symptoms resolved quickly. He was discharged but had a seizure on the way home and returned for further therapy. Today he states that he has a bad headache but is otherwise feeling improved. His meningitis therapy was reinitiated on admit.  Impression: Patient is a 45 year old man with post covid syndrome including tachycardia, weakness and now with seizures likely as a sequelae of the disease. His initial presentation included an extensive workup with negative imaging, labs with a leukocytosis that resolved quickly and CSF studies that had a lympo/mono predominance, all consistent with seizure activity. Patient said that he had his flu shot Thursday and he wondered if it could have contributed by causing more inflammation. It is possible the shot caused an increase in his overall inflammatory state. Vaccines have been described as causing aseptic meningitis although these are rare events. We will be sure to report this occurrence to the VAERS database.    Assessment/Plan: 1. CSF pleocytosis, aseptic meningitis- likely seizure related. Ok to d/c antivirals, antimicrobials. Vaccine induced vs part of the sequelae of long covid. Difficult to discern. Will report to VAERS 2. Seizure d/o- per neurology 3. Leukocytosis- resolved 4. Post covid, long covid diagnosis- continue to follow with appropriate consultants.

None of those tests have determined any functional issue with my heart, nor any obvious scarring or inflammation. It's not fully clear if this was related to my vaccine other than time of onsite was highly correlated with my second shot. Since the initial issues in May, I have trended towards better, with the LBBB usually now only occurring at very high heart rates ranging from 160-180bpm.

Despite being vaccinated on 04/2021 with J&J. In the ED, the patient desatted (87%) with ambulation. He was admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He became gradually more confused, developed worsening kidney injury. The patient also had a CT with evidence of an intramuscular hematoma attributed to coughing with supratherapeutic INR. This was reversed with Kcentra. For his COVID pneumonia treatment, he was given regneron, decadron 6mg, remdesivir for 5 days and tocilizumab once on 10/24. He had multiple rapid responses called on 10/24 and 10/26 for increasing O2 requirements. His confusion and respiratory status worsened and on 10/27 he was admitted to the ICU. He was intubated on 10/29, found to have elevated troponin, worsening renal failure and CT findings of cavitary lesions and severely damaged lungs.

On 6 October he received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in the morning and then found that he injured/twisted his right ankle.  He injured it one more time that same day and then it had persistent numbness over the top of the foot and difficulty raising the foot.  About a week later he noticed, in addition to those persistent symptoms in the right foot, that his hands/fingers were tingling and he had some trouble with fine motor use.  He then received multiple other vaccinations recorded on 12 October are vaccinations for adenovirus, twinrix, polio, menveo, menactra, Tdap, varicella.  MEDPROS not available for confirmation (menactra and menveo would not normally be given together as they are both meningitis vaccines).  His symptoms persisted and he sought care from primary care, was referred for specialty care with physical medicine and neurology which ultimately led him referred for consideration of IVIG treatment for presumptive diagnosis of AIDP.  Here the neurology service feels the diagnosis may be AIDP or HNPP, but neither diagnosis is conclusive.  Past medical history is significant for receipt of most childhood vaccines with the exception of HAV and potentially one MMR.  He had HBVx3, Dtap x4, IPV x3, HiB x4, PCV x4, varicella x1 and MMR x1.

1851143,11/08/2021,UT,14.0,14,,F,,3 Days after the 2nd Covid shot my daughter started her period despite the fact that she is on birth control daily to help with bad menstrual cramps and migraines that seem hormone triggered and she hasn't had a period for a few months. After the 2nd shot her period came back within days and lasted for two weeks which has never happened in her entire life and is not normal in my experience for any woman. It was heavier than normal bleeding for longer than she has ever experienced. Then again the next month she got a very painful period again despite taking her Norlyda pill as prescribed daily. It really seems like all of this was connected to her receiving the second vaccine. A friend of mine warned us of this as it happened to her too and her periods had been regular her whole life so it really stood out to her too as abnormal.

I brought my 7 year old to the local pharmacy today at 1 pm. The nurse who administered the vaccine wasn't wearing a mask or gloves. She put on one glove when she actually injected my daughter, but wasn't wearing any when handling the vial or the syringe.   When she found out my daughter's age, she unnecessarily commented, ""oh she's so young."" After my daughter received the vaccine, and we were waiting, I overheard the pharmacist and nurse disagreeing about the amount of vaccine that had been given to my daughter, and the other children that day. The pharmacist felt the nurse hadn't given enough in the syringe, neither was going to tell me, but luckily I overheard them and confronted them.  The pharmacist felt the nurse had used too much saline (1.85 ml) to dilute the vaccine, and as a result the nurse should have given a larger amount. The nurse disagreed, and they told me they were waiting for a ""higher up"" at the pharmacy to weigh in.  The nurse said many times that I should not worry about the amount, and just to watch my daughter for side effects.  I now feel that she purposely administered a lower dose. I'm not sure if my daughter received a correct dose, and am quite frustrated that this has happened.   I want to report this so that someone can help me determine if she received a correct dose, and what our next steps should be. And also, to have someone look into the nurse and the incident, so that this doesn't happen to any other children and families.   I have reported this to the pharmacy, and am awaiting a response from the District Manager. I'm not sure if you can help, or if this is relevant to you, but someone provided your contact info and suggested I share as you are researching a similar incident at another pharmacy.

It felt like the filler in my cheeks had moved around in my face.  After a few days, the discomfort abated.  7 Nov 2021, on the right side of my face, namely my cheek area, I began feeling discomfort.  Today, 8 Nov 2021 the discomfort is worse.  Painful to the touch.  Again, it feels like the filler in my cheeks is moving around.  And again it is painful and swollen at the highest point of my cheek.  Unable to get ahold of the physician that I use for botox and injectibles, I began to google.  Then in dawned on me that all of this started after I received my booster shot of the Pfizer Covid vaccination.  So I googled COVID shot, face swelling, filler.  I found that it was an adverse reaction reported with the Moderna Covid vaccine.  So I added ""Pfizer"" to the search.  COVID shot, face swelling, filler.  I found a study and report that the discussed the rare adverse reaction of dermal fillers and the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine.  I received dermal fillers in my cheeks in May 2021.  This was after my first 2 COVID vaccinations.  Because it definitely feels like there is something going on with the fillers in my face.  It's weird, uncomfortable and scary.

The RN believed she may not have injected the needle far enough into the client?s tissue and based on her observation, most (more than 50%) of the vaccine appeared to leak out of the needle and drip down the client?s arm.

She had developed a cough that started approximately 6 days ago after receiving her booster Pfizer COVID vaccine. She developed diarrhea 2 days later. She has not had any fevers or chils. She lives with her husband and states that she started feeling more short of breath today. She began having difficulty with ambulating around her home to just use the restroom. She has no history of CHF, COPD but does have a history of atrial fibrillation.  In the ED, she received 1 dose of Rocephin for presumed UTI.

CXR 10/29 with diffuse bilateral infiltrates but there is a more distinct lobar pattern in the RUL. Cannot rule out a secondary bacterial pneumonia. She was not able to maintain her O2 sats on HFNC and a nonrebreather and was placed on BIPAP. This is not an ideal situation because she is not expected to improve quickly and cannot tolerate any oral intake/nutrition while on continuous BIPAP. However, she is currently maintaining acceptable O2 sats on BIPAP and work of breathing also appears to be acceptable. Her body habitus places her at higher risk for difficult intubation as does her oxygen requirements. It is reasonable to keep her on BIPAP overnight as long as her work of breathing is stable and oxygenation can be maintained but she will likely need intubation in the morning unless FiO2 requirements have improved to the point she can transition back to HFNC + nonrebreather.  - continue ceftriaxone empirically for possible bacterial pneumonia - Ok to continue BIPAP 12/6, FiO2 95% for now.

1851844,11/08/2021,VA,71.0,71,,M,,"I was on methotrexate and Actemra for rhematoid arthritis with Pfizer vaccines.  With the second Pfizer dose, my right hand swelled two days later with painfull itchy zoster-like lesions on the back of my hand.  There was resolution in a week.  For this reason, I chose Moderna for my third vaccination off of all immunosuppressants. Two days after the Moderna shot, I woke up with flu-like symproms, a dry cough and tachypnea. Three days later, the cough and tachypnea got worse.  I also developed precordial chest pain and a bout of near syncope with a systolic BP of 70.  The hypotension lasted about an hour.  On day #4, I woke up with worse non-radiating heart pain with dyspnea.  My SpO2 was 75% and I called Emergency. Additional information for Item 18: There was never any fever.  The rescue squad called in an elevation of my ST segments in V2 and V3, then gave me aspirin.  In the ER, I received SoluMedrol 125 mg IV.  My chest pain improved in 6 hours.  My cardiologist called me to stop taking dofetilide since my QT interval was >500 and that my troponins were elevated but not high enough to suspect a heart attack.   CXR in the ER showed bilateral infiltrates with ground glass appearance.  Since the D-dimer was elevated, a chest CTA was done.  There was no pulmonary emboli, but ground glass infiltrates were noted.  Doxycycline was started IV since WBC's showed a marked shift to the left.  I also received high flow nasal O2 and later heparin. Later that day, I was transfered to an isolation room.  The COVID nasal swab was done in the ER and then on the floor a few days later; both were negative. On Sept 13, I went into atrial fibrillation.  Dofetilide was restarted and my rhythm converted to NSR.  On 9/14, an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% and a pericardial effusion was not seen.  Prednisone 20 mg qd was started on the 15th to be continued for five days with a rapid taper.  I was off of O2 on that day with a SpO2 in the 90's.  On September 16 (the day of discharge) a 6 minute walk test was performed.  The SpO2 dropped into the low 80's, and the pulse went up to 135 BPM.  I also experienced some chest discomfort.  On my own, I gave myself an injection of anakinra.  I was discharged with an oxygen concentrator.  I continued doxycycline for two weeks. Anakinra daily injections were continued for 10 days, then Actemra (tocilizumab) was resumed.  Five days after discharge, I no longer had tachycardia or dyspnea with brisk walking.  I still have an occasional dry cough which does not interfere with sleep.  A high resolution CT of my chest is ordered for November 17th with follow-up with my pulmonologist.  I do have a history of myopericarditis following an ablation for atrial fibrillation in 2016.  The ablation lead to hemorrhagic tamponade and a pericardial window to drain 1100 cc of blood.  The pericarditis was treated with prednisone and colchicine.  Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis involving the hands and heart was diagnosed shortly thereafter.  Methotrexate did not control the arthritis.  As an immunologist, I researched treatment for rheumatoid pericarditis and found anakinra.  The effect was remarkable, and it was continued for two years.  There were occasional breakthroughs with high exertion cardio activities requiring resumption of anakinra.  I kept two weeks of treatment  ""just in case"".   I brought one week of anakinra with me in the ambulance and left it in the hospital refrigerator.",,,,,Y,6,,,U,09/07/2021,09/09/2021,2,"9/11/21 troponin 23;  WBC 6,900 88% segs; albumin 3.4, total protein 5.3, glucose 193; COVID-19 nasal swab (negative) & repeated 9/14 negative;  10/6/21 SARS-Cov2 nucleocapsid IgG...

1853128,11/09/2021,MI,,,,F,,"ACUTE MOTOR-SENSORY AXONAL NEUROPATHY; CERVICAL STENOSIS; HYPOXIA; SYMPTOMATIC BRADYCARDIA; HOARSENESS; LIGHTHEADEDNESS; This spontaneous report was received from literature: A Rare Variant of Guillain-Barre Syndrome Following Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination. This report concerned a 49 year old female of white (Caucasian) race and unspecified ethnicity.  The objective of this study is to describe a rare variant of GBS with a temporal relation to the Ad26.COV2.S. The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient's concurrent conditions included: neurofibromatosis type 1, hypothyroidism, and multiple vitamin deficiencies and the patient was healthy. The patient's history was negative for any recent illnesses, changes to medications or lifestyle, domestic or international travel or exposure to any known sick contacts. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose, start therapy date were not reported,1 total administered for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. It was reported that on an unspecified date the patient was presented to her primary care physician with new-onset numbness in her extremities for a duration of one day. She experienced reduced tactile sensation and numbness in her right upper extremity, extending from the elbow into her hand and bilateral lower extremities from her knees through her feet. She had associated headache with pain to palpation across her forehead, lightheadedness, and aching lumbar pain of four days duration. The patient received the vaccine five days prior to the onset of her symptoms. Later due to acute neurological involvement of her multiple extremities with reduced tactile sensation, the patient was directed immediately to the emergency department for further evaluation. During the initial emergency department evaluation, the patient endorsed difficulty walking and holding objects in addition to the previously reported symptoms. These difficulties were thought to be secondary to altered sensation rather than resulting from musculoskeletal weakness. Physical exam revealed orbital, jaw, and neck pain to palpation. The patient was afebrile, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) negative, and showed no signs of infection or electrolyte abnormality on initial complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis (UA). Thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and muscle-specific kinase antibodies were within normal limits. The only abnormal blood work seen was an equivocal B12 level of 187 ng/L (normal 180-914 ng/L). She also underwent an MRI of her brain and cervical spine for concerns of multiple sclerosis given her multiple neurologic symptoms. Brain MRI revealed small punctate foci inconsistent with multiple sclerosis or acute neurologic findings. Due to equivocal B12 levels and non-specific MRI findings, the patient was given a B12 injection and discharged to her home with instructions for outpatient follow-up with neurology. It was also reported that the patient returned to the emergency department next day with worsening generalized weakness and paresthesia. The patient also noted new hoarseness and dysphagia, thoracic back pain, and urinary incontinence that had all developed within the 16 hours since her emergency department (ED) discharge. In ED (emergency department) triage, the patient collapsed to the floor without loss of consciousness or seizure activities. She was afebrile, hypertensive to 171/98, and hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the mid-80s.Her physical exam was positive for symmetric weakness in bilateral lower extremities. A CT (Computed Tomography) angiogram of the chest was ordered for concerns of a developing aortic dissection, which was unremarkable. Additional imaging was then ordered, with an MRI of the brain, which showed moderate cervical stenosis. MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine was also conducted but was otherwise unremarkable. Her lumbar puncture revealed elevated albumin (normal less than 27.0 mg/dL) and IgG (normal less than 8.1 mg/dL) without signs of meningitis or multiple sclerosis and the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to her rapidly progressing neurological symptoms. The patient's physical examination was notable for bilateral extraocular muscles weakness, decreased pinprick sensation in all four extremities, with preserved temperature and vibratory sensation, 4 out of 5 strengths in the right upper extremity, bilateral proximal lower extremities, and bilateral finger flexion, with preserved 5 out of 5 strengths in the left upper extremity. Additionally, reflexes were tested and showed 1plus in bilateral biceps and brachioradialis and absent at the bilateral patella and achilles. By hospital day 4, the patient became almost quadriplegic, along with bilateral facial nerve paralysis and a weak gag reflex. She required bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) initially and eventually intubation. Given her rapid neurological decompensation, with sensory symptoms with negative workup and recent history of vaccination, clinically, neurology suspected this was a rare variant of GBS called acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). She was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). On hospital day 13, she remained intubated without significant improvement despite four days of IVIG. She developed symptomatic bradycardia that required pacemaker placement. On hospital days 23-32, the patient received a course of plasmapheresis, due to lack of clinical improvement, and a tracheostomy. On hospital days 33-54, the patient underwent physical rehab and ventilatory weaning at Select Hospital. On hospital days 54-63, the patient was readmitted by neurology for a second round of plasmapheresis and an additional dose of IVIG. Following these treatments, she had gradual improvement in her weakness. On hospital day 64, the patient was transferred back to hospital. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Albumin (NR: 0.0 - 27.0) 46 mg/dL, Anti-muscle specific kinase antibody (NR: not provided) within normal limits, Blood pressure (NR: not provided) 171/98 mmHg, Body temperature (NR: not provided) afebrile, preserved, CSF oligoclonal band (NR: not provided) Negative(reference-negative), CT pulmonary angiogram of the chest was ordered for concerns of a developing aortic dissection, which was unremarkable, Complete blood count (NR: not provided) no abnormality, Comprehensive metabolic panel (NR: not provided) no abnormality, Glucose (NR: 40 - 80) 77 mg/dL(reference-40-80 mg/dL)(CSF Values ), IgG (NR: 0.0 - 8.1) 8.8 mg/dL(reference-0.0-8.1 mg/dL) (CSF Values ), IgG (NR: not provided) elevated, Lumbar puncture (NR: not provided) abnormal, MRI (NR: not provided) unremarkable, Oxygen saturation (NR: not provided) mid-80s, Physical examination (NR: not provided) orbital, jaw, neck pain, abnormal, positive, Protein (NR: 15 - 60) 58 mg/dL(reference-15-60 mg/dL)(CSF Values ), Red blood cell count (NR: 0 - 10) 368(reference-0-10 RBC/mcL) )(CSF Values ), SARS-CoV-2 test (NR: not provided) Negative, Sensory level (NR: not provided) negative workup, Thyroid stimulating hormone (NR: not provided) within normal limits, Thyroxine (NR: not provided) within normal limits, Urinalysis (NR: not provided) no abnormality, Vitamin B12 (NR: 180 - 914) 187 ng/L, and WBC (NR: not provided) 0(reference- less than 5 lymphocytes/mcL)(CSF Values ).  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the lightheadedness, hoarseness, hypoxia, symptomatic bradycardia, cervical stenosis and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy was not reported. The Author concluded that the unique presentation of the rare variant of GBS, AMSAN, can make a prompt diagnosis challenging and difficult. When evaluating patients with progressive paralysis with and without neuropathy, GBS should remain in the differential, even if patients do not follow exactly the characteristic stocking and glove pattern. Early involvement of the neurology team in suspected cases may help diagnose patients presenting with some of the unique neurological features, ultimately allowing for quicker intervention.

This consumer reported two doses for the same patient. This is the second dose. An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY) via an unspecified route of administration in Jul2021 (Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid 19 infection at age 17 in Jan or Feb2020 and recovered. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 in May2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced eyes burn. The caller stated she heard a report on public radio about super immune responders- people with a HX of Covid-19 infection who when they receive Covid-19 vaccine, they develop a super immune response (inflammation all over the body, breathing problems). Asking if we have any information on this or if we can refer her to any research programs that are studying super immune response. States she is calling on behalf of a family who has an 18 years old female child who developed covid 19 infection at age 17 in Jan or Feb2020. States covid 19 infection went right through the high school with many students developing covid 19. States this 18 years old patient recovered from covid 19 infection however when she had the Pfizer covid vaccine approximately one year later developed extreme reactions to the vaccine. States the patient developed mild reactions to the first shot but became very ill with the 2nd shot. States the 2nd shot swelled her lungs and neck; patient complained of not being able to breathe. Caller states this patient developed 'extensive issues'. States her heart was ok. She recovered with steroids. Upon transfer, the caller clarifies the patient's parents heard a segment on the Public Radio about super immune responders and the parents wanted to know if this is what happened to her daughter? The caller is an Occupational Therapist and has had extensive medical training. The caller states she does all kinds of research for families and she ran into this patient's family who asked the caller if she thought it was a super immune response. The caller explains she knows the patient and worked with the patient before so she told the patient's parents she would try and find out information and report what happened to her. The family is at a loss. The patient is better, but from what the family understood from listening to the radio, there is a study being done and there is a particular university looking for people who had a super immune response the patient's family didn't know if the patient should be in this program. The caller states she didn't know about it. The family has no idea what is going on. The caller believes the patient got her second shot in early Jul2021. The caller states she can't remember what the parents said, but she knows the pediatrician told the patient to wait however many weeks after the normal period of time before she got her second shot. The caller clarifies maybe the patient got the first shot in May, not Jun2021. She only knows the patient waited several weeks for her eyes not to burn before she got the second shot, so it would be better to put the date of the first dose as May2021. After the second shot, within 24 hours she was crying, she didn't know what was wrong. The patient said her legs hurt. The patient didn't really have a fever, but she was miserable so they started giving her Advil. This went on and on slowly and the caller guesses it started affecting her lungs and the patient started complaining of breathing problems. Her neck swelled up. The patient's pediatrician thought it was thyroid cancer and sent her for a thyroid ultrasound. The patient was just miserable. This started in the Summer so the patient was not in school. The patient was asked for a cardiac appointment and was sent for an echocardiogram. They were told the patient's heart was working correctly. She continued on Advil twice a day. The third doctor stated she really needed steroids. The patient was fine after the first dose of steroids, her lungs returned to normal. The patient experienced 60 days of miserableness. The patient was very active before the vaccine and now the patient is not as active. Her family doesn't understand what happened to her. The caller clarifies further the third doctor put her on steroids, like a tapered dose where she was taking 5, then, 4, 3, 2, 1. The first day, the patient thought she was fine. The patient is still not fully recovered. The caller ran into the patient's parents on Saturday. The caller adds she knows the family extensively and the parents explained they heard of the article on the radio and asked did the caller think their daughter is a super immune responder? She informed the family she would call Pfizer and see if she found something. The caller explains the previous agent informed the caller that it appears what she was describing was a hyperimmune response. The caller states no one treated the patient for about 60 days until the doctor put her on steroids, which seemed to stop the lung inflammation. The patient is not playing sports at the rate she was before this all happened. The caller wanted to find out where the studies for super immune responders heard on the radio were being done?

A 16-year-old non-sexually active female presented to the pediatric gynecology clinic with vaginal pain. Six days prior she had received her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine. Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, she developed fever, fatigue, myalgias and sores in her vaginal area. Over the next 2 days, right sided lesions in her vaginal area coalesced and became more painful. She presented to urgent care with a fever of 105 degrees Fahrenheit where she was diagnosed with a Bartholin gland abscess and prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanate. Despite antibiotic therapy, her symptoms continued to worsen prompting her to return to clinic two days later. By this point, the lesions were covered in exudate with a necrotic, ring-like border. Gynecology was consulted and recommended assessment for likely Lipschutz ulcers. In gynecology clinic, the patient's lesions were exquisitely painful, resulting in difficulty with urination, defecation, and walking. She had no respiratory symptoms and no known COVID-19 exposures. Her medical history was significant for several congenital conditions requiring corrective surgeries including soft palate cleft, club foot, syndactyly of her left foot and congenital hearing impairment in the right ear. Additionally, the patient reported a history of recurrent oral ulcerations, but no previous history of genital ulcerations. Her family history was notable for severe canker sores in her father and uncle requiring medical intervention and hospitalization. The patient denied any history of sexual activity. On exam, the patient was afebrile and in no acute distress. Her genitourinary exam was significant for an ulcerated lesion with adherent yellow and grey fibrinous exudate on the right labia minora measuring 3 cm x 2 cm. The ulcer was well-demarcated with a necrotic appearing border. Desquamation was observed of the surrounding tissue and the posterior fourchette. The affected right labia was markedly swollen in comparison to the left. Laboratory evaluation was negative for SARS-COV-2 RNA by anterior nares swab. Viral polymerase chain reaction testing of the vulvar lesion was negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 as well as serum testing for HSV 1 and 2 antibodies. Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies were present, indicating prior infection with EBV. Testing for CMV, syphilis (RPR), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Fluorescent antinuclear antibody screen was negative. Clinical history and genital examination findings were consistent with vulvar aphthous ulcers in association with influenza-like symptoms following Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was prescribed topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment and instructed to apply to the affected area twice daily for 14 days. Her pain management regimen included ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed, as well as topical lidocaine gel. She was started on norethindrone 5 mg orally daily for menstrual suppression while her ulcerations were healing. She presented for follow up two weeks later and reported improvement in her symptoms, although she was experiencing sensitivity with vulvar manipulation and pain with urination. The ulcerated lesion was noted to be resolving along the medial aspect of the right vaginal introitus. Vulvar edema had resolved. She reported the appearance of an oral ulcer several days prior and physical exam was consistent with aphthous ulcer on the inner aspect of her lower lip. Patient was referred to rheumatology in light of her recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, vulvar ulcer and family history of oral ulcerations. The case was submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) due to the temporal relationship with COVID vaccine administration.  Summary and Conclusions This is the first case report to describe a potential relationship between the development of vulvar aphthous ulcers and COVID-19 vaccination. Our patient had typical clinical features of aphthous ulcer including an influenza-like prodrome and characteristic dermatologic manifestations which occurred after receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  The temporal relationship of our patient's symptoms to Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccination in the context of a negative test for SARS-COV-RNA, as well as other infectious etiologies, suggest that her systemic symptoms and vulvar aphthous ulcer may have occurred secondary to an immune response precipitated by the vaccine. However, there are several other factors in this patient, including evidence of past infection with EBV and medical and family history of recurrent oral ulcers, which potentially contributed to their presentation.  This case suggests that vulvar aphthous ulcers may be precipitated by vaccination, however, further research is required to establish a causal relationship. One proposed mechanism for study is to investigate how the immune system's response to vaccination recapitulates the pro-inflammatory response associated with vulvar aphthous ulcers secondary to viral illness.  Event occurred in a country different from that of the reporter.  This may be a duplicate if the reporter also submitted directly to his/her local agency.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: Based on the description given in the narrative, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the Serious event  Aphthous Ulcer and the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,,,,,,,N,,,,Test Name: fever; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:105 Fahrenheit; Test Name: CMV; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: human immunodeficiency virus; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:present; Comments: indicating prior infection with EBV; Test Name: exam; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:afebrile and in no acute distress; Test Name: Fluorescent antinuclear antibody screen; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: genitourinary exam; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:significant for an ulcerated lesion; Comments: with adherent yellow and grey fibrinous exudate on the right labia minora measuring 3 cm x 2 cm.

He was fatigued.  He went home and the second day felt continued fatigue, heart palpitations and SOB, and nausea, chills, fever. The third day, 7/8/21 he started noticing widely fluctuating HR 52 at baseline rose to HR 110 and felt SOB , chest tight and throat tightness and went to ER who did a workup that was inconclusive.  He has had intermittent palpitations since and during workout he is getting SOB that is unusual.  This is a previously active and athletic individual.

She reported fatigue, cough and decreased appetite.  She did not have any difficulty keeping her transplant medications down. Upon presentation she was mildly hypoxemic and her chest x-ray appearances of normal.  There was some question of volume overload since her BNP was elevated at 7000. She was given a dose of Lasix, but a repeat chest x-ray was no better.  However echocardiogram showed small IVC.  Her abnormal chest x-ray was thought to be more related to COVID than volume overload. She was placed on 2 L supplemental oxygen and was monitored closely.  Her CellCept 250 mg twice daily was placed on hold due to her COVID infection.  Infectious Disease Service was consulted and they recommended Decadron if worsening oxygen requirements. She was able to wean off oxygen and did not have ambulatory desaturation when assessed by Pulmonary Rehab.    She had a slight trend down in WBC/ANC. This would be monitored as an outpatient and did not require Neupogen while hospitalized.

Once we started going back to doctors I eliminated all these things and with my primary physician we decided to do MRI of the brain. That came back ok and with the time my numbness never disappeared but it was not as constant or I perhaps learned to live with it.

A day or so later, after the bruise showed up, I had swelling - 3x3 inches below that injection bruise - it was swollen and had almost like a rash on it.

Even now, it's not real dark, but I can still see where it was. A person could look and see it. I did call the hospital and they told me to report it.

The doctor at the facility said it's nothing and sent me home. I felt fatigue, headache, joint pain and dizziness the same way but could do daily activities. Headache went away soon, but joint pain, fatigue stayed. I felt dizzy here and there but got worse. I lost consciousness for 1-2 seconds and fell to the ground on 10/31/2021. I went to see a physician and he said my dizziness is one of the side effects I'm having due to covid vaccine. I got the x-ray done. There was an avulsion fracture at the lateral malleolus.

I called my primary care physicians on call for urgent issues around 5 PM. They were hesitant to send me to the ER with COVID spreading in the community but told me to set a very low trigger threshold for going in. I did not end up visiting the ER as the chest pain and shortness of breath resolved about 8 hours after symptoms started. The fever went away overnight Nov 6-7.
