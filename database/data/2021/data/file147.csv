She reported that after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, her neutrophil count had been very low. She mentioned that she has a history of chronic lymphoma for which she has been treated in the past. She was currently in remission and was not going through any treatments for the lymphoma. She sees an Oncologist and Hematologist for regular checkups. She was diagnosed with Shingles in May 2021 for which she was put on Valcyclovir. Because she still has the infection, she has been on the antiviral treatment since  May 2021. She stopped taking the shingles treatment to see if it would make a difference in her neutrophil count, but nothing happened for 2 weeks after stopping the medication and her neutrophil count was still low. She then decided to restart the Valcyclovir treatment.

However, the patient developed very low neutrophil count after this second dose that was still ongoing at the time of this report (laboratory findings with reference ranges were not provided).

Company comment: This case concerns a 41-year-old male patient with no medical history provided, who experienced non-serious unexpected events of SARS-COV-2 test positive and Drug ineffective. The events occurred approximately 9 months and one week after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, approximately 8 months after the second dose and seven days after the third (booster) dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The patient was only tested positive for COVID-19, however, no information regarding patient's accompanying symptoms has been provided at this time. The rechallenge was not applicable since the patient experienced the events following the booster dose of the vaccine. Based on the current available information, the mRNA-1273 does not contain a virus capable of causing COVID-19 infection after vaccination, therefore, the causality for SARS-COV-2 test positive is not applicable, while the causality for the event of Vaccination failure is assessed as possibly related.

1994751,12/31/2021,WI,57.0,57,,M,,"Started out as a rash on my left torso in early July. Over time it started spreading and I started getting hives. The hives seemed to ""travel"". They would go away from one spot and then pop up in another. Zyrtec helped some but not completely. The itching seemed to ""change shifts"". For awhile it would be worse in the morning � other times in the evening. There were several periods where I could not sleep more than 2 to 4 hours without waking up because of the itching. In October and  November the hives began ""weeping"". It was as if some sort of toxic glue was oozing out of my pores and it was at times painful, especially after getting out of the shower. By the end of November it seemed to have evolved into eczema. Dry itching flaky skin all over my body. I went to Urgent Care on November 27 because the pain and the itching were unbearable. I was prescribed Oral steroids � Antibiotics � and prescription Antihistamines. They fast tracked me an appointment with the dermatologist he he prescribed topical steroids. Since the beginning of December I have been taking Hydroxizine 1 every six hours. Zyrtec 1 every 12 hours. On around Dec 10 I started taking a ""mega -dose"" of vitamin D3 5000IU one every 12 hours. The healing seemed to accelerate after I started the D3 and it seemed like my histamine levels also continued to lower. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY THAT I SENT TO ALLERGIST Symptoms: Symptoms began on approximately July 12 2021. Scaly patch on left and right torso and on shoulders. In a short time progressed and spread with hives on legs and behind the knee. Wound on left leg from scratching in my sleep.  I had already had problems with itching on that leg due to venous stasis dermatitis.  Water and sweat make affected areas itchy red and swollen. On most nights I can only sleep 2 to 4 hours at a time before waking up with itch. Sometimes the affected areas have a burning sensation. On a few other rare occasions the patches on my torso felt as if they tickled. There is nothing consistent about the intensity,frequency, and location of the symptoms. They vary from day to day and hour to hour. I must make note that the patches on my torso disappeared after the first 3 weeks and then returned about 1 week ago.  Triggers: Water � Sweat  Sleep The condition is sometimes (not always) triggered by pressure from sitting or lying down.  Treatment: 1 H1 (Alternate Zyrtec and Allegra every other week) + 1 H2 (Tagamet)  2X per day (every 12 hrs.) Tylenol � for occasional pain flares in wound on leg. Relieve itches by applying hair dryer to affected area. Elevate legs against the wall with pillows behind back. Walking to increase  blood flow and distract from itching.   Supplements: 2 Adult Multivitamin 2 D3 1 B3 1 Zinc 1 E  � tsp. C crystals dissolved in 100% Cranberry juice 3 drops nascent iodine + 1 Selenium B12 supplement 1 to 2 times weekly  Herbals: 1 Ginkgo Biloba 2 Echinacea/Goldenseal 1 eyedropper of Echinacea tincture Ginseng supplement  1 to 2 times weekly NOTE: I have been drinking Green Tea w/lemon juice (NO SUGAR) nearly every day for approximately the last 4 years. I use several brands but I have not changed them or the source from where I buy them.    Have had bad reaction to:  Benadryl ( both Oral and topical) VERY bad reaction to Zzzquil. I am allergic to it. Hydocortizone  -  Swelling on leg after scratching which led to cellulitis. Calamine Lotion � intense itching � had to rinse off immediately. Cetaphil - intense itching � had to rinse off immediately. Aloe Vera Gel - intense burning � had to rinse off immediately. Coconut Oil � was very irritating. Neosporin greatly irritated leg wound. NOTE: During the first few weeks I tried several ""home remedies"" by washing up with water and a very small amount of   *Tea Tree Oil   - minimal to zero effext  *Apple Cider Vinegar burns if not diluted properly. *Bleach  initially cleared up patches on torso but is too dangerous for any areas of broken skin. *Baking Soda (initially soothes but does not last) *Gold Bond Lotion � initially soothes but wears off fairly quickly. Comments: *Sometimes hair dryer brings relief for as long as 12 hours. Other times it does not help at all. *Hair dryer works more often than it doesn't. *Hair dryer satisfies the urge to scratch and  feels as though I am actually scratching *Sometimes taking NyQuil allows me  to sleep as long a 8 hours. Other times I wake up itching 2hours after taking it. * Prednisone helped only on the 1st day I took it. After that there was not much difference. * Hydroxyzine  helped only on the 1st day I took it. After that there was not much difference. * I do not like the way Prednisone and Hydroyzine affected me mentally and physically. *Gabapentin literally makes me intoxicated. On day two I woke up itching 2 hours after taking it. *Tested my well water with a kit that checks 13 conditions. PH reads 9 to 10. Alkalinity 240ppm. All others good,. *I cleaned and flushed both the water softener and water heater. Hardness level was dramatically    improved,however my symptoms are still aggravated when my skin gets wet. PH still at 9. Alkalinity reduced to 180ppm.  Reliability of home water test is questionable. We no longer have white powdery residue on topsoil of houseplants.    * I stopped drinking the tap water about two weeks into this however there was never any effect either way. *THERE HAVE BEEN NO  CHANGES IN MY DIET, ENVIRONMENT, OR THE CLEANING PRODUCTS THAT I USE OR THE CLOTHES THAT I WEAR. It is still however possible that the manufacturers may have added ingredients. It is also possible the airborne allergens may have been introduced into my environment.  * We have no pets in  our household nor do I have frequent encounters with animals. * We have numerous houseplants that we have had for 10+ years. We have not purchased any new plants in the past year. *Aside from intermittent clutter on desks and tables, our house is clean. My wife regularly sweeps ,mops ,vacuums and dusts. *We run an air purifier most of the time to help my wife with her allergies (filter changed routinely) *I do yard work � mowing and weeding � weekly and sometimes daily. I usually bathe and change clothes immediately afterward. * Aside from my symptoms and lack of sleep there have been no other excessive stressors in my life. *NOTE: On two occasions last year (2020) , I had a minor unexplained rash on both wrists that lasted for about 3 weeks. Both of these incidents seemed to coincide with a peak of Covid cases in the local region as reported in the news. I had no other Covid symptoms and I never got tested. During both periods there were a few employees at work who had tested positive and had to quarantine. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    It was in mid December that I discovered perhaps a dozen threads on a web forum discussing similar experiences after receiving the covid vaccine. Threads that were posted on the forum discussing skin disorders that were similar to mine. Most of these occurred after receiving a Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Although there is no actual proof that the MRNA vaccines are the root cause of these disorders, there seems to be too many people with a similar experience to just simply ignore this. It is not my intention to make negative and aggressive accusations, but to make the medical community aware of  this problem and to hopefully prevent other people from going through months of extreme discomfort as I have.  As a side note I must also mention that these posts cannot be found using the usual search engine. I found them using a different search engine.   Below are Doctor's notes from my appointments.

Progress Notes 10/29/2021  3:30 PM History of Present Illness: See both today's allergy questionnaire and dictation for complete HPI elements including location, quality, severity, duration, timing, context, modifying factors and associated signs and symptoms. Allergy questionnaire also compliments PFSH.      The patient is a 58-year-old who I am seeing at the request of Dr. for my opinion on his urticaria.  According to the patient, since July he has had urticaria on a pretty much daily basis.  There have been a few days and he has done better and he has tried everything under the sun to help him with his symptoms.  High-dose antihistamines, namely both 4 a day of Allegra and Zyrtec, did not help.  Prednisone did not help, at least more than a day, and he has tried all sorts of lotions and creams and avoiding things.  What seems to work the best for him is if he heats up in a hot shower or a hair dryer, I think he de-granulates his mast cells and then they do not release the histamine again for 6-8 hours, but that is certainly not a quick fix.  He has had a lot of allergy testing and food testing.  He has definitely a lot of positive ImmunoCAPs, but he has done elimination diet and that has not revealed any results either, that no specific food is causing any problems, at least at this time.  He has had a normal CBC and chemistry profile and he does not have any other symptoms.   Review of Systems:  Including constitutional, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, respiratory, cardiovascular and GI are all negative except as noted.   Physical Examination:  Revealed a well-developed, well-nourished 58-year-old in no acute distress.   Impression/Plan:  My impression is that patient has chronic idiopathic urticaria, unresponsive to high-dose antihistamines and unresponsive to prednisone, and at this point we will prior authorize him for Zyrtec since he has failed these prior treatments.  He is not committed to doing the Xolair.  He has read a lot about it and is reluctant to start it, but I said we will prior authorize him and at least offer it to him, and we can take it from there.  He will call with any questions or problems and he will call me if he would like to proceed.

Clinical Data: Pruritic dermatitis x 30 days DIAGNOSIS: PUNCH BIOPSY, R flank: SUBTLE LOW GRADE SPONGIOTIC DERMATITIS (SEE NOTE) Specimen Site: R flank Gross Description: Specimen received in formalin, vial labeled with patient's name, 5x3x4 mm skin wedge. Punch, tan, not oriented. 1 piece tissue received, 2 portions submitted in 1 block. All tissue submitted. Microscopic Description:  Original and multiple deeper sections contain a punch biopsy of skin with a very sparse superficial perivascular inflammatory-cell infiltrate. There is very minimal spongiosis. There is focal and minimal parakeratosis as well. The inflammation is lymphohistiocytic in nature. Diagnosis: SUBTLE LOW GRADE SPONGIOTIC DERMATITIS (SEE NOTE) Note: The changes are extremely subtle and are not unequivocally diagnostic. There is very minimal spongiosis and on balance, given the clinical impression, I slightly favor a low grade spongiotic dermatitis such as contact, nummular, or atopic dermatitis. Nevertheless, these changes are quite subtle in zones and therefore entities such as asteatotic dermatitis could conceivably produce such findings as well.

On 17-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 608 iu/ml 21 days after dose 2. In April 2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 126 iu/ml 8 weeks after second dose (consistent with a  half-life of 16.3 days, calculated by exponential decay). On 08-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) Sequencing revealed an extensively mutated B.1.628 SARS-CoV-2 variant with 10 mutations in spike protein, including E484Q and N440K and positive (Positive) with cycle thresholds of 20.8 (N�gene) and 21.8 (E-gene). On 08-May-2021, Viral load: approximate 400,000 Approximate 400,000. On 21-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 37,400 iu/ml 13 days after the positive PCR for COVID-19 and 23 days after the likely exposure on 4/28, increased over 250-fold to 37,400 IU/mL.. On 28-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 34,700 iu/ml 34,700 IU/mL. On 20-Jul-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 4070 iu/ml 4070 IU/mL. On an unknown date, Body temperature: 101 �f 101 �F. On an unknown date, Oxygen saturation: 92 % 92 %. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 5.74 iu/ml Baseline anti-spike IgG of 5.74 IU/mL (below the assay background of 50 IU/mL).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter considered COVID-19 (severe breakthrough COVID-19 with a heavily mutated variant) and DRUG INEFFECTIVE (Lack of drug effect) to be related.    Patient had no evidence of pre-existing immunity to COVID-19. Patient was thought to confer significant protection after vaccination, as the second value was 37th percentile when compared to similar specimens from vaccinated healthy controls in our recently published study.  Patient left the Country and flew to Country and developed pharyngitis, myalgias, rhinitis, and severe coughing resulting in a subconjunctival hemorrhage on returning home. He subsequently developed diaphoresis and fever. Patient met with the criteria for severe COVID-19 with an oxygen saturation of 92% but declined hospitalization. Symptoms persisted for another 10 days before beginning to improve, and he recovered fully during the next month.  Company comment: This literature non-study case concerns a 61-year-old male patient with a relevant medical history of Multiple myeloma in remission undergoing treatment with Lenalidomide, Ixazomib and Methylprednisolone, who experienced the unexpected - according to CCDS - serious (medically significant) event of COVID-19 (AESI) after mRNA- 1273 Moderna vaccine. Additionally, Drug ineffective was considered. The event occurred approximately 10 weeks after the second dose of mRNA- 1273 vaccine. Clinical manifestations included pharyngitis, myalgias, rhinitis, cough, pyrexia and decreased oxygen saturation (S92%). The patient had criteria for hospitalization, but declined it.  SARS-CoV-2 test was positive, sequencing was performed and showed a B.1.628 SARS-CoV-2 variant. His symptoms had a duration of 10 days, and patient fully recovered after 1 month.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of myalgia, pain in extremity, muscle twitching, insomnia, tinnitus, arthralgia, neuralgia, gait inability, inflammation. Additional information: Things were pretty good. Legs hurt little bit when walked a lot, which didn't exist before  Went in and the nurse was concerned about it. Stated he needed to have some protection from this thing. 3 days later, pain again in legs started. Pain didn't feel like legs were being beat or hit with something, but they ached inside. He was toughing it through Taking Advil and Tylenol and all kinds of stuff trying to keep pain under control. Would sleep for 5 hours if he was lucky. States then maybe it will start to wear off, the immune system response is wearing off. Figured if it's not going away, it's getting worse. From what he was reading, in 10 weeks. the immunity to COVID is built up. Thought when the immunity stops building up, maybe the pain will stop then, but it didn't. Started developing twitching in muscle in his legs all the way down to his feet. Almost feels like he had shingles once when he was in his twenties from chicken pox or wherever it comes from. When he goes to walk quite a bit, it feels like the pain is getting the muscle like when had shingles. He talked to a doctor, a neurologist who is retiring and explained what was going on. Neurologist stated what's happening is the antigen from the virus is lodged in muscles in his legs. The nerves are picking up the foreign objects and sending pain signals that something is wrong. Was advised to take Gabapentin 100mg at night and 100mg in morning because it needs to turn the pain off so the sensory nerves will die. This has been going on. Gabapentin does help, but makes him a little groggy. Taking Advil because he believes there's inflammation there. Taking fish oil to relive inflammation. Taking Vitamin C. Caller was speaking to his pharmacist about what the neurologist advised him to do. Pharmacist said eventually it should go and hopefully caller will build sensory nerves back without pain. States it's really strange. He's talked to so many people. Heard many different reactions people have. Nobody is having anything like he is having. Caller was a pro athlete. Never had any particular injuries. Would like to get rid of this problem. He had his 2nd shot on 28Jul2021, he was feeling good, his legs are working okay, he hasn't been able to use his legs a lot because they hurt too much to use for 10 days. After getting the 2nd dose, he didn't feel any reaction for 3 days, but then his muscles and joints begin to hurt again, mainly the hip joints, tinnitus started in his ears, that went on. He's on his 15th week of pain in his legs and it had been getting worse and at around 12 weeks, his muscles and legs began to twitch. Per caller, the Primary Care doctor doesn't have any idea on what medication he should be taking. He's taking Tylenol and Advil, he's also taking Gabapentin for 2weeks. Caller also added that he spoke to his Pharmacist who's giving out Pfizer-BioNTech. He had been having muscle pain now from his hips now to his feet for 17 weeks. He had a lot of leg pain going on from the vaccine. He was desperate after 17 weeks of pain. The provider who was trying to contact us is a neurologist who has him on Gabapentin 100mg, up to 4 a day. A couple of weeks ago his muscles were hurting so bad, that it was incapacitating him and could not walk, and the leg muscles from his hip to his feet were twitching. Most of the twitching has dissipated, but if he walked around too much they start to ache more. He was cutting branches outside before this. He take one of our products Advil, he took 1 to 3 a day, and it helps a lot. Tylenol does not touch it. He took 200mg of Gabapentin today and will take another 100mg at 11:30 at night when he went to bed. His own doctor who has been his doctor for 25 years. He took fish oil, he spoke to an advisor, and he recommended fish oil which he was up to 7000mg a day now, and turmeric is very good antioxidant for inflammation. The doctor was looking for medications that may be given to people with muscle pain, because he says about 14 to 15 percent of people have this problem, but maybe not as long as him.

Additional information: No other vaccine in four weeks. Other medications in two weeks were reported as Digoxin, aspirin, a statin drug calcium, other supplements. It was reported that patient received his shot, nine days later. Large red egg on his upper right arm. That stayed for another 9 days and was still there, just not red. Hurts all the time. His body ached and his heart starting beating fast. He had taken digoxin for 30 years. He knew about fast beating hearts. Knew that an ingredient in his shot monopotassium phosphate may increase the hyperkalmic activity of digoxin. No one asked if he took a heart pill at the Pfizer blitz at his local clinic. He was not a scientist and off course they will say he misunderstood what he read. Did not matter. They did not test digoxin and the interaction. How many died. They call it underlying heart issues. Or his favorite age. He asked to don't call him elderly like they did at the start of this form. It is disgusting. that tells he that they don't care about anything but making money. What is 1percentage of 5000. Should that many have a reaction or die. Just wondering. Patient did not had covid prior vaccination nor tested for covid post vaccination. Patient had known allergies. Additional information: After reading their letter and looking at their questionnaire he had a couple of questions. Are you really asking me for all of my medical and my family medical information? Why? I want more information than you telling me that you want information. Isn't that private information. I will tell you it was in my left arm not my right where I received the shot. That shouldn't make much difference. I still had a reaction. Please be clearer in your request. I did visit with a couple of people about your request and will be visiting with one more when they are available. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were none. Patient was not sure what he should say. On 10Mar he went to the Pfizer Blitz the local clinic. it was fine. Nothing happened until 9 days later when he come out of his morning shower and looked in the mirror and saw a red oval shaped swelling on his left arm above his small pox shot and going up to the top of his arm. He did send an email to the clinic and someone wrote back to put a ice pack on it. He had sent them a picture even. The ice pack didn't work. He had paroxysmal SVT and he took digoxin for it. He had this for most of his life. He know about his heart. The next day it was racing and the digoxin was not working. No one at the vaccination clinic asked if he had a heart condition. Their whole purpose was to get a needle into his arm. It was like a picture of the army lining up recruits to give them every shot they could. He wasn't impressed. It wasn't just his heart that acted up, there were odd things like the side of his mouth was numb at times. His arms, hands and legs ached and burned. Them were odd things that happened like for about 3-4 months his hair curled like he had a perm put in it. Everyone would comment how nice his perm was. It was so thick and curly. He kept cutting it and now in Dec it is back to what it was. He still have curls but not like what he had. He spent a lot of time on the internet studying the ingredients of your vaccine. No one on digoxin should take your vaccine. (i know i am not a great scientist but when it says that digoxin can interact with monopotassium phosphate and you list monobasic potassium phosphate, he really begin to wonder and yet no one mentions it. Even if i am a 1% of the population, it is too many. if you have 5000 people and 1% die of a reaction or even have some reaction, it is too many. Get out of your sterile labs and see people, not statistics. He went for his annual physical (yes i go every year) and my digoxin levels were down and his blood pressure was up. So I was put on a beta blocker as well as the digoxin. He finally went off of the digoxin because heart acted like it had the hiccups. So for now, he was on a beta blocker, his arm still hurts and he can see a faint outline of the egg shaped whatever it is. He had bacterial pneumonia in Apr2020 and spent 4 days in the hospital. It started with a viral sinus infection but he couldn't get well. Everyone thought he had covid. He didn't. But, as a result of the pneumonia, his potassium level went below three and he spent a few hours in outpatient on potassium ivs. It hurt. He had nothing more to say. He had a letter from his doctor not to have anymore vaccine. He stay away from people. He work from home. He still wear a mask. He was more afraid of vaccinated people than he was of unvaccinated people. Vaccinated people think they are entitled to do what they want. They have convinced people that vaccines are the way to go. Penicillin was thought of that way also and they found people became immune to it. Will that happen with vaccines, also.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

And then a week about that time started getting really got bad back pain and really never ever in life had back pains and it kind of moved around.

Because the doctors have done tests and everything and they cannot figure out why her red blood cells are dropping or the B12 was dropping and D3 was dropping."" Treatment: Consumer stated, ""Yes, she had iron infusion and she had been on strong Iron pill and 50000mg of the D3 and a 1000 of the B12.""

But she thought since she had the shot last year her first shot was 20Feb2020 and then March, she had to make a correction, it was 20Feb2021 and then her second short was 13Mar2021 and she just got her booster shot 15Oct2021. And she thought may be the side effect, she thought she was no doctor she just thought in 05Jun she started having problems with her red blood cells dropping and she had no energy to do anything. she thought she was being tired because she just moved in June so she thought she was just being tired from the move, so she moved the first week of Jun and so the second week she can't do anything because she was still tired, but third week she said something was quite not right and then the last week of Jun she can barely move and then she knew something was wrong and then she called to make appointment because she just can hardly do anything, she was just so exhausted all the time even after having her iron infusion (Unspecified infusion) in Oct. So, she was wondering was that one of the side effects of having Pfizer shot.""

Additional information:  Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was reported as none. Additional vaccine administered on same day was reported as none.  The reporter explains she was guessing the timeline because her symptoms started in the middle of the night and she didn't look at the clock. She was guessing about 18 hours post injection, she woke up during the night with excruciating pain in every muscle, joint, and long bone in her body. Every single bone from her hips to her toes- literally her toe bones and everything were extremely painful. Then, from her armpits down to her fingertips and then back was in pain. She states her stomach was pretty much the only area that didn't have a lot of pain. She explains this side effect lasted until that following night. She clarifies this excruciating pain stopped the night of 12Dec2021. She finally took one Tylenol at about 19:00pm on 12Dec 2021. Prior to that, she hadn't taken anything because she wanted the vaccines to have the best immune response that they can have and since they don't really know if painkillers can affect that or stuff, she really tried not to take any. However, at that point, she had to take one because she couldn't function. She couldn't sleep. She tried to go to sleep but because she was in so much pain, she couldn't sleep either. The reporter clarifies the only thing she was experiencing now was what some sites are calling COVID arm. The pain at the injection site and arm isn't bad. She does have swelling, redness, rash around the injection site and it itches like there was no tomorrow. This was something she had not experienced before either. The reporter states itching was actually worse. The rash, redness and swelling has stayed about the same, but the itching has increased. She had not actually looked at her arm at the injection site so she don't know when it first began, but she can tell that the itching portion started when she muscle and bone pain subsided. She had a longer period of time between her Moderna doses. It was 6 weeks between doses instead of 4 weeks because she had really severe side effects with the Moderna vaccine. Her and her doctor discussed that it was better to wait a couple of extra weeks in between the first and second doses in hopes that the side effects wouldn't be so bad she would have to be hospitalized. Her doctor was worried her side effects may be so severe she would be hospitalized. This was another reason she decided to try Pfizer for the booster, in hopes she wouldn't have such intense side effects from it as she did with the Moderna vaccines. She has not started any new prescriptions. With over-the-counter stuff, like supplements, she can't think of anything new there either. The patient was administered the vaccine in a pharmacy. She has a rare underlying condition. The adverse events did not require emergency or physician's room visit.   The reporter explains with the Moderna vaccines, they were expected adverse effects but were just extremely intense. She had the chills. She had her thermostat set in the 80's and she was under a blanket/comforter and still was literally shaking and her teeth were clattering. She still had the chills like this 5 days later after the injection, it was really intense. She had about 6 months worth of extremely intense skin issues. Her psoriasis may have typically been half of a dime size and it was going to 4 inches in diameter. Her psoriasis was being intense all the time, it was like flea bites over the top. She mentions she previously had her Shringix vaccine a couple years before and she got shingles again. She had massive amounts of skin issues for like about 6 months. Until the vaccine antibodies seem to be going away, that's when her skin issues went away, so she was pretty sure they were related. She had a rare condition called Mitochondrial cytopathy. She clarifies it was a neural metabolic disorder. She explains medications drains right through her. Something that may supposedly last 4-6 hours, may last an hour with her because the effects are out of her system. She had surgery where she had a block done and she should not have been able to move her legs. When the surgery was done and she just scooted herself onto the gurney. All of the medical stuff were shocked and flipped out because of the amount of medication she was given for her size, she should not have been able to do that. Her body metabolizes so much quicker that these types of scenarios happen with all sorts of different medication.

The only medication that she is on is Coumadin and she has been on that for years due to blood clots, deep vein thrombosis. The patient received Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot Number: 30155BA) administered in left arm in the afternoon as dose 3, single for covid-19 immunization. She had symptoms after her booster shot which she had in 06Oct2021. She has had severe diarrhoea and it's still ongoing. She had been taking Imodium and Pepto-Bismol for it and it will slow it down but when she goes off the medication the diarrhoea comes back and gets watery and forceful. She then would take antidiarrhea medication and it would settle it down and then she would have another rebound and twice she threw up with it. That began shortly after the booster, about a week after the booster shot if she remembers right. Inquired for outcome of the diarrhoea and she stated that she would say it's not as bad as the first two bouts were that she had where she did the throwing up. She had been watching what she eats and is trying to drink the electrolytes to keep her energy up, because that takes a lot out of a person, and then she will go 3 to 4 days and she was fine and then it would start up again. She would say that sometimes she could go about a week between bouts and usually that's when she was taking the Pepto-Bismol for it. She clarified that the throwing up was in the later part of Oct2021 and she has not had any more of that since then. Product clarified to the booster dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) included Flu shot in left arm on an unspecified date. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Adverse event did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. She had her flu shot between her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine and her booster dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, but she doesn't remember the exact day. She thinks that it was maybe 2 weeks before her booster dose.

The patient received her 2 doses of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine and the booster. After her 2nd dose she had some reactions ""saliva building up in mouth, tingling of lips and tongue and throat started to close off. After the caller received her booster dose yesterday (15Dec2021) she had those same reactions like after the 2nd dose but additionally had abdominal issues like she is used to experiencing when ingest nuts. As per caller, her stomach felt like her gut was being squeezed or pulled and usually when that happens she has to immediately take Alavert or Benadryl to make it stop. Yesterday while she was at the center the doctor told me to go ahead and take the Alavert and if that didn't work they would give me something else. She stayed a little longer to make sure she was ok, the Alavert did help and she started to feel better. When she got home she was instructed to take Benadryl which she took and fell asleep. Today she still have a little tightness in the gut and throat, but she know it will pass by tonight like it did last time. Caller is allergic to peanuts and all nuts. Caller added in her medical records it says she should take Septra (it cut off breathing) or another product for the bladder (for overactive bladder). She has never had a reaction to vaccines. But anything with coconuts, peanuts that's even found in shampoo she get hives and rash. After the booster, she couldn't taste her dinner. She had left over food that had bacon in it and she couldn't taste the bacon. She had vanilla and chocolate ice cream and couldn't taste the chocolate. Her taste buds were off. She had a flu shot a couple of weeks ago and had no problems. This is the first time she has had a reaction to any kind of shot. She had all her shots has a child. Caller reporting adverse event with second dose and booster dose of COVID19 Vaccine. By the time she gets the shot and walks to where she has to sit, she gets saliva to build up. It is a lot of saliva in her mouth. Inside her lip starts to get tingling and her tongue. Then after 15 minutes she could feel a weird taste in her mouth. Her throat starts to close off. With the second dose she took Alavert. It is an antihistamine tablet that melts on her tongue right away and then had to take Benadryl when she got home because it was difficult to swallow. After the booster, at the 15 minute mark, her abdomen started to get really tight. She has allergies to peanuts, coconut, and all nuts. That sensation in her gut was like if someone didn't tell her there was coconut in something she ingested. She took Alavert and it seemed to help and within a minute or two the pain in her abdomen stopped the squeezing. She needed Benadryl when she got home. What ingredient in this vaccine could be doing this to her? Medically she needs to know so she doesn't get a Pfizer medication with that ingredient. Her throat is still a little bit swollen. The abdomen area feels a little tight.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of hypertension, which included losartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The patient relayed that since having the two primary doses, she had experienced high blood pressure since Mar2021. She did not have high blood pressure prior to receiving the vaccine. She stated that the nurse should have taken her blood pressure before the shot and after to see if it went up. She had seen a cardiologist and had an EKG and an echocardiogram done. She had been placed on high blood pressure medications and 'water pills.' She stated her blood pressure would go up to 220, 198, and 183. She had read a study that the vaccine causes high blood pressure. She relayed that the doctors didn't know and that they deny the high blood pressure was related to the vaccine, but that she was sure it is. She would like Pfizer to know that this was a side effect. The patient expressed concern that she currently had to take medications to treat her blood pressure, but that they would have negative effects on her kidneys and liver over time. She stated that she did not feel bad or have any physical symptoms of the high blood pressure. The patient was asking what ingredient was causing the high blood pressure. She stated that myocarditis and pericarditis were known side effects with the vaccine and wanted to know how she would know if she had inflammation in the heart. It was relayed to the patient that elevated blood pressure was not a side effect that was reported during clinical trials and because of this, there was no data for it and was referred to speak with healthcare professional (HCP) if she was concerned for this condition or had further questions. The patient did not know if she should receive the booster dose of the vaccine or if it would just make her blood pressure higher and her doctors did not know. The patient was asking if she could have the Moderna booster dose instead. The patient was again referred to speak with HCP regarding fruther questions. It was further reported that she was due to get the booster and she had concerns, but nobody could answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that ''her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the COVID-19 vaccination, but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021, wherein they woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. Her blood pressure was high at night, but she took medication in the morning during the day so its lower during the day. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she had high blood pressure; she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy, since this was the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knew and read research that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine had blood pressure increased. She was asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis and was asking if the booster would make her blood pressure worse. The patient reported that for 5 months, she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increased, so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy, the doctors rejected it, clarified the doctor stated that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to CDC the benefit outweighed the danger. The blood pressure went through the roof was discovered during the colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. The patient further reported that she was looking online for the booster. She had two Pfizer shots. First one on 27Feb2021 and the second one on 20Mar2021 and she had terrible side effects. The doctors were saying it's not possible. The patient was trying to get the tests from the doctor's what was causing the high blood pressure and they didn't know. The EKG was normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal, and they were saying they didn't know, but she should take medication for the high blood pressure, but she refused the medication, because she was a senior citizen and was in excellent health. The patient didn't have any problems till of the Pfizer her blood pressure went over the roof and she started to be very concerned and so she didn't take any high blood pressure medication, because she didn't want more side effects, but her blood pressure stayed in April, in May, in June, in July. Then her doctor told her that she could drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and she had to start the medication. So, she started the medication like two or three months prior reporting. The doctor prescribed losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told her that she should take a water pill, so, that's a long name for that medication. She didn't remember the name, but it's a water pill. So she was taking those two medications and they increased losartan to two pills, so she was taking 1 in the morning, 1 in the evening, and in the middle of the day, she was taking the water pills. So, during the day, her blood pressure was much lower, it was like 150, 160, 140, but at night if she woke up, since she didn't take medication, it still could be 180, 195. The (withheld), they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer, the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, she had this concern because, she spoke to the doctor about the booster. She was afraid to take Pfizer booster, because it might increase to the problem with her heart and they said, CDC, they commented that the benefits outweighed the side effects.

Additional information: Patient took the Pfizer Covid booster dose on a Sunday morning and at 9-10:00am her husband and she both did that at withheld and her symptoms did not happen immediately but she came home 2-3 miles from her house and by the time she got to the house which may be 10-15 minutes from the time she was administered the booster shot she immediately felt like someone had poured water on the wicked witch and she withered away and felt drained immediately and was very extremely tired and it was like she immediately dropped like a drug in her face and it was a drug and told her husband she was so tired. Caller states she had a similar reaction after the 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine when she took it which required her to stay overnight close to the facility where she had it administered because coming home she was falling asleep in the car and it almost caused her to get in an accident so she pulled over and had to sleep for a while and then drive home. States with her 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine this did not completely happen but with the booster vaccine the fatigue was so advanced and is ongoing very much and as a result of this people are asking has this impacted the callers other functions and what she ends up doing now is she gets up and walks and she walks to a slant and no one figured out that maybe it is something going on with her like the itching or something and she did have itching maybe 3-4 weeks ago and went to the allergist and they did not find anything wrong. States she has had heavy breathing and they told her to keep taking her nebulizer and she is on that but they said to continue to take the nebulizer and she is maybe having a slight reaction to the weather and maybe pollen is high so she overlooked that.   As per product complaint information vaccine supplemental form completed in additional context.

During this period, everything has fallen apart, lost track of paperwork, money, bills, just sort of unplugged. Last friend passed away a year ago so does not even have anyone to talk to. The patient has mitral valve prolapse syndrome. Born with this, very pronounced heart murmur. Both parents had this condition and pacemakers. Controls AFib with 2 Magnesium maleate pills 2xday. Because of this and MS has to be careful with heart. Dysautonomia connected to this. Heart is fine, but chemicals get out of balance; because of that has opposite reactions to all drugs. Has been gluten free for 44 years, that's how she survived. It was reported that the patient left administering facility about 30 minutes after being administered first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine. Further described as very sick, heart palpitations, thought would have a stroke. In her neck, all the glands in her neck, lymph glands in neck swelled up; she thought she was having anaphylactic shock and almost went back into the hospital to show them; but instead went home and gave self-treatment. Caller reported that the only treatment for this event was self-treatment with Vitamin D, Vitamin C, a little bit of enzyme and aspirin and it worked. She treated as anti-inflammatory and it worked. No other testing, treatment or medical interventions performed relative this event. Event improved, she still has stiff neck all these months later and lymphatic glands swollen which scares her to death. After the first dose, her lymph nodes and neck swelled up. She was afraid that she was having anaphylactic shock, but it didn't get that far. Her neck got so stiff that for a day or two after the shot she couldn't turn her head. She still has some stiffness, and her lymph nodes are still a little swollen. She ran a fever, and because of her pre-existing consisting conditions of mitral valve prolapse and MS, she is heat sensitive. Her whole body is so sensitive that she cannot live in a retirement home because they keep it so hot in there; she likes it cold. She treated the fever aggressively for 2 days, with vitamin C, lysine, and took 2 Aspirin daily for a couple of days; she also drank lots of water, rested, and stayed cool. Running a fever and getting over heated gave her a rapid heart rate and palpitations. She had exacerbated MS symptoms. She has a very abnormal body with dysautonomia, so she has reactions to a lot of medications. She was born with the dysautonomia, but it took them many years to figure out that she had it.

In March 2020 I had a mild case of Covid-19 with no late after effects and in February 2021 twice received mRNA Covid vaccines (Pfizer) without incident. A routine health exam on October 13, 2021 included basic laboratory tests, all of which were normal except for elevated glucose, and I was given a Flu shot. The very next day I had a Covid-19 booster at a local pharmacy ? then things got complicated.  On October 15, 2021 I attended an outdoor event and stood for nearly two hours in 80 degree heat. Feeling faint, I lay down and drank water and that night was surprised to note gross hematuria. I had no history of kidney disorders and only the next day was there moderate left flank pain. A CT urogram revealed a radiolucent 7 mm stone obstructing the mid left ureter. I was hospitalized and when a urologist inserted a ureteral stent to decompress the kidney, the stone was pushed back up into the renal pelvis. Three weeks later ureteroscopy and lithotripsy was performed, the stent then was reinserted for three more weeks. (Follow-up CT urogram performed on 1/3/22?..)   Almost unnoticed amidst all this, a rash had developed behind my left eyebrow, soon followed by small lesions on the temple, forehead and nose. Then there was unilateral neck and scalp tenderness that initially I attributed to cervical arthritis ? until I awoke on December 4 with slightly blurred vision and noted conjunctivitis of the left eye. I realized that the rash corresponded with the dermatome of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and only then did I understand that Herpes Zoster (HZ) from long forgotten childhood chickenpox must have become activated. An ophthalmologist confirmed presence of acute iritis and increased intraocular pressure and I was begun on eye drops, including tapering doses of a steroid.. I?d never received a shingles vaccination and it was decided not to begin an antiviral because by now, it probably was several weeks since initial eruption of the rash and scalp tenderness ? too late for benefit.

The events ""she had bloody eye, completely bloody/blood vessel that broke"", ""her feet were swollen"" and ""she could not see her ankles"" were evaluated at the emergency room visit. Clinical course as follows: She is currently 71 years old. She wanted to tell about the side effects of Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Now she is due to get the booster and she has concerns and nobody can answer her questions. She suffered from side effects, clarified that her blood pressure went over the roof after she had the first and second dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Her blood pressure went up to 220. They did not check her blood pressure during the covid vaccination but she had an appointment for a colonoscopy on 10Mar2021. They woke her up and was shaking her like she was so angry, she was told her blood pressure was 220 and then 193 and then 185. They called all the doctors and made such a big fuss and did an EKG. All the time she went through all the tests, she was asking herself why she has high blood pressure, she thought it was connected to the colonoscopy since this is the first time she knew about her blood pressure being elevated. She knows and read research from France that a lot of patients that took the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine had blood pressure increase. She is asking what ingredient in the vaccine could be causing the blood pressure increase. Asks should she take the booster. She was a 100% healthy person before the Pfizer covid vaccine. She read it causes myocarditis. Asking if the booster will make her blood pressure worse. Reports that for 5 months she refused to take medication, she thought maybe the side effects would disappear if it was from the vaccine and she was drinking beets and celery to lower the blood pressure. She wanted to know why she had the blood pressure increase so she went to the cardiologist and had tests. Even during the colonoscopy the doctors rejected it, clarifies the doctor states that her increased blood pressure had nothing to do with vaccine. When she asked her primary doctor if she should take the booster, she was told according to cdc the benefit outweighs the danger. She had 3 strange episodes, one day she woke up and she had bloody eye, completely bloody and she called doctor and she was asking the nurse what it could be. She thought maybe her brain is bleeding. She went to ER but she was not admitted. She saw the doctor and looked in her eye and said it is just a blood vessel that broke and nothing needs to be done. One day she woke up and she noticed that her feet were swollen and this has never happened before her in life. She was so surprised she could not see her ankles. This happened one to three months ago. patient stated, ""I was looking online for the booster. I had two Pfizer shots. First one 27Feb2021 and the second one, 20Mar the same year (2021) and I had terrible side effects. You know the doctors were saying no it was not possible. My blood pressure went to 220 after the Pfizer and it stayed 193, 185 its stayed for months and I was trying to get the tests from the doctors what was causing the high blood pressure and they were saying we did not know. The EKG were normal, the blood tests were normal, the urine tests were normal and they were saying we did not know but you should take medication for the high blood pressure and I refused the medication because I am a senior citizen, age 71 (Further not clarified) and I was in excellent health. I did not had any problems till of the Pfizer my blood pressure went over the roof and I started to be very concerned and so I did not take any high blood pressure medication because I did not want more side effects but you know my blood pressure stayed in Apr, in May, in Jun, in Jul. Then my doctor told me that I can drop dead anytime from high blood pressure and I have to start the medication. So, I started the medication like two or three months ago. The doctor prescribed Losartan and the blood pressure was still high like 179, 175. So, they told me that I should take a water pill, so, thats a long name for that medication. I did not remember its a water pill. So I am taking those two medication and they increase Losartan to two pills so I take 1 in the morning 1 in the evening and in the middle of the day I take the water pills. So, during the day my blood pressure is much lower it is like 150, 160, 140 but at night if I wake up since I did not take medication it still can be 180, 195. So, I want to report this to you because I found online information from France. The French they did research and they found the side effects of Pfizer the heart inflammation, the muscles or in the chamber or on the outside. So, I have this concern because I spoke to the doctor about the booster. I am afraid to take Pfizer booster because it may increase to the problem with my heart and they said, CDC, they comments that the benefits outweigh the side effects. So, I did not know if I should take the Pfizer booster and I am worried because you know there are restrictions for people who did not take the booster that like if I want to travel if I did not show that I had the booster maybe they will decline my travel. So, I wanted to report that because I did not make it up its really happened to me and I am sure it happened to other people and I visited cardiologist and he did not know what is causing the high blood pressure. What is the reason? What is the ingredient in the Pfizer that effect the heart? Because you see now when I was reading about side effects it says myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles. Pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside heart. So, is the booster going to bad for me. I want the Pfizer to give me answers. Should I take the booster? Because I am 71 and I did not want to have heart problems. I did not want to be paralyzed or have a heart attack. So, can you give me the answer?""

However with this booster dose, I had a severe response that evening with very bad myalgia, shaking chills, with some nausea and headache.  The reaction was so severe that I could not sleep, and could barely get around. Finally at 1:00 AM I took a Tylenol with only minimal relief.  In the morning, I still felt like I had been ""hit by a truck"", to the point of tears because I had work to do.  I took one more Tylenol at noon, trying to minimize analgesics.   This was quite unexpected, as I had no anxiety about getting the booster shot, and on-line information reports that the reaction to the Moderna booster had been  about the same or better than to the primary vaccinations.   I actually double-checked with the pharmacist this morning that the booster dose is reduced to .25 ml, and they say that it is. I am writing about this adverse response because the booster shot is being so strongly advised, and required in some circumstances.    While I have been very pro-vaccine, I would be loath to have another booster if this is going to happen routinely - the reaction has been honestly frightening.  I wonder if there needs to be a closer look taken at the interval time and dose for this first booster.

Booster shot (Moderna) made the ringing worse possibly doubled the noise just days later 1-3 days. Both ears now ring loud enough to hear while walking outside or in the office at work. I also hear a fluttering or pulsing sound almost like pressure or heartbeats, usually fast but sometimes pressure sounds from my actual heart beat which is not as bothersome as the ringing. A doctor prescribed me 250mg of oral steroid pills for 4 days which made my face and eyes puffy, vision really blurry and made it hard to sleep. The pills did nothing at all.  The doctor stated that I don't have any hearing loss and thought it might be stress But I have not been under any stress ever.

In contrast, the pain that began on March 6 was excruciating, incapacitating, and resulted in her barely being able to walk and was, therefore, new, noteworthy, different and unusual.  3/08/21 - Visit #1 to the ER  for excruciating pain. - Pelvic x-ray done, nothing broken; IV morphine given. - Examination by ER physician. - Released from hospital; sent home with script for Norco for pain; did not take because it made her unable to function.  Note:   (Mom) identified the source of her excruciating pain to the ER physician as being in her lower left back region, just at the top of her left pelvic bone, as witnessed by a family member.   3/22/21 - Visit #2 to the ER  Hospital for same excruciating pain (as March 8) and ultimately admitted. - EKG, CT scan, MRI spine, MRI pelvis and whole-body bone scan done during length of stay.  No new findings, only evidence of old fractures and spondylolisthesis, all of which were known, old diagnoses.  3/23/21 - Examination by PA-C for Chief of Orthopedics and subsequently by Hospital.  Note:  Despite the fact that this was the second admission in three weeks for the same pain that was originating from the same source, the orthopedic specialists focused on old compression fractures, old pelvic fractures, and degenerative spinal changes, which (Mom) lived with every day with little complaint.  The source of the excruciating pain that began on March 6, and that was reported on March 8 in the ER, appeared to have been excluded from consideration or discussion.  3/26/21 - Released from hospital with short course of steroids for pain; minute reduction in pain until steroid dose was weaned and the same excruciating pain, that began on March 6, immediately emerged again.  4/7/21   - Visit #3 to the ER  for same excruciating pain (as March 8) and ultimately admitted. - Lumbar/AP spine and dorsal/thoracic spine x-rays, front pelvic & 2 view left hip x-rays, front chest & 3 bilateral rib x-rays, EKG, Echo done during length of stay. - Examination by Hospitalist Internal Medicine.   - Examination by Orthopedic Surgeon.   - Examination by Pain Management Specialist/Neurologist.  4/10/21 - (Mom's) acute inflammation and excruciating pain were diagnosed as Trochanteric Bursitis.  A Depo-Medrol steroid shot was given in left hip area by Pain Management Specialist/Neurologist for the acute inflammation and pain (Mom) had been experiencing for the five weeks since the second Covid-19 shot; pain relief within hours after the steroid shot.  By the end of the day, she went from not being able to walk to walking to the end of the hallway within the hospital.   4/13/21 -  (Mom) was to be transferred Hospital  for rehab program, however, due to spontaneous bleeding of her fistula, she was kept at Hospital for observation.  (Mom's) Vascular Surgeon was called in to help stop the bleeding.    Note:  The spontaneous bleeding from (Mom's) fistula seemed highly unusual as it had never occurred in six years of receiving dialysis.    4/15/21 - Fistulogram performed by Vascular & Interventional Radiology Specialist to ensure fistula was in good working order.  Results showed no stenosis.                  4/16/21 - Transferred to Hospital  for inpatient physical therapy rehab program.  4/23/21 - Released from hospital after successful completion of the rehab program. (Mom) had a positive frame of mind and was looking forward to future plans.  She was able to walk again with the aid of her walker and to function independently; in-home therapy began 4/29 to build up strength she had lost during the 5 weeks of excruciating pain and time spent in the hospital.  5/2/21 -  Spontaneous bleeding from fistula, no blood pressure, heart stopped.  Cause of death ruled (spontaneous) bleeding from fistula.",Y,05/02/2021,Y,,Y,23,,,N,03/04/2021,03/06/2021,2,"See Continuation Page for timeline of events, lab results, treatment and outcomes.",SEN,,"Norvasc, Aspirin, Coreg, Phoslo, Dialyvite, Synthroid, Vit D3, Probiotic, Turmeric, Omega 3 fish oil, Vit B Complex",None,"High blood pressure (controlled), CHF (controlled), ESRD (In-Center Hemodialysis)",,,2,12/31/2021,,Y,Y,"Penicillin, Iodine, Lysinopril"

Facility does not have a lot of equipment. She had tests done at another facility.   Mom had a stroke on April 1st, 2021. My sister and I recognized it as a stroke on the phone, just talking to my mom. The nurses & medical personnel at the facility did not acknowledge or seem to recognize that she had had a stroke. It took them all the next day to get her transported to the Hospital. The Hospital did say she had a stroke (see 1st page of medical report). We believe the vaccine & shot stroke may be related. The Facility may be trying to cover up something (esp. the stroke).  All day at Nurses office was admitted to hospital at facility later in the day.  They dragged her around all day until she had a stroke while there. Did not transport her until late on April 2nd.

The patient began feeling poorly several days prior to her admission to the outside hospital.  She became increasingly short of breath and developed lower extremity swelling.  She was evaluated in the ED and found to have an elevated BNP of 1700.  She was admitted and started on scheduled IV Lasix diuresis.  Around 8:45 PM the evening of transfer to our facility, the patient developed new slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and left facial droop.  A CT of the head was done, and showed evidence of old stroke and prior aneurysm coiling but no acute abnormality. The case was discussed with MD of neurology and the patient was transferred to another facility for a higher level of care.  On arrival here, an MRI of the brain was done, and showed right frontal and left cerebellar infarcts.  MRA of the head was unremarkable.  2D echocardiogram showed a preserved LVEF of 75-80% without evidence of PFO of clot.  Carotid Doppler showed no significant stenosis.  The patient was evaluated by speech therapy, who recommended strict n.p.o. status due to her high risk of aspiration.  She ultimately required placement of a PEG tube on 04/14/2021.
