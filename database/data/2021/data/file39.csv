Pt states that approximately 3 to 4 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer) on 2/16/2021 she noted blurred vision in left eye and over the course of the next several days, started to have worsening blurring as well as darkening of her vision to the point where she was only able to see faint outlines of objects. Did also have some associated visual hallucinations with this. Seen in clinic (exact date unknown but sometime between 2/16/21 and 3/8/21) where a visual acuity exam was done, and no further evaluation was recommended. But pt had ongoing issues and was ultimately seen by ophthalmology on 3/8/21 and was then directed to the ED on 3/8/2021 for possible stroke evaluation. In the ED, CT of the brain was negative for acute stroke. MRI was advised, but patient declined during that ED visit and voiced preference to schedule outpatient, however, she was never able to make that appointment. On 3/9/21, pt received her second COVID-19 vaccine, and 1 to 2 days later, she developed the same symptoms in the right eye, though does not feel that her visual acuity decreased by as much in that eye as it had in the left eye. Pt also has had mild associated frontal headache since her first COVID-19 vaccination, but it responds readily to acetaminophen. Pt seen in ophthalmology clinic again on 3/16/21. At that appointment, she had a funduscopic exam which showed mild temporal pallor and ophthalmology felt that this is likely inflammation of the optic nerve or optic nerve sheath, likely secondary to retrobulbar optic neuritis versus perineuritis possibly triggered by recent vaccination. Request was made for admission to Hospital for further evaluation and management. Hospital Course (admitted 3/16/21 ? 3/22/21): MRI of the brain and orbits revealed optic neuritis. In consultation with neurology and neuro-ophthalmology the pt was started on a 5-day course of methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily. The pt noted improvement in her vision rapidly.

1145396,03/29/2021,MI,24.0,24,,F,,"Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  Around 4 in the afternoon I started getting more intense pain in left arm.  By 5 PM I was starting to get mild nerve pain in the same arm, and the pain had spread from my left arm to include my neck and upper shoulder.  By 8 PM the nerve pain was getting worse and the muscular pain had spread to 2 inches bellow my shoulder blade (concentrated on the left side) and included the aforementioned areas. At 11 PM I noticed that my sense of touch was altered on the left side of my body, and the nerve pain was steadily getting worse.  I could feel pressure but not fine discriminative touch, and had little reaction to touch (I usually have a lot of hypersensitivity, and react very strongly to the slightest amount of touch). I tried going to bed around 12:30 AM but was not able to fall asleep until after 5:30 AM because the nerve pain was so sever at this point.  Positional changes and ice did not help, and I ended up taking Advil at 5:15 because I couldn't deal with the pain anymore.  This dampened the pain enough that I was able to go to sleep at 5:30 AM. The nerve pain was a 8/10 and went down my ulna to my 4 and 5th fingers.  This was some of the worst pain I have experienced in years. I have some lingering nerve pain in that arm (as well as dampened sensory sensation on the left side), but it is not as bad as it was the night of the vaccine.",,,,,,,,,N,03/27/2021,03/27/2021,0,,PVT,,"Levothyroxine (0.025 MG), Omeprazole (20 MG), Estarylla, Zertec, Juice Plus, Vitamin D",,"Fibromyalgia, hypothyroid",,,2,03/29/2021,,,,"Chlorhexadine, dairy, formaldehyde"

Nothing changed about my medications, my routine, or anything I put on my skin that could cause this. I will visit my doctor if it doesn't fade or gets worse.

Went to ENT on 1/11, diagnosed with acute on chronic sinusitis, prescribed Augmentin & Prednisone to start 48 hours after 2nd vaccine dose. Sinusitis did not explain headache as I've never presented with headache in the past. 2nd vaccine dose 1/14/21; began Augmentin & Prednisone on 1/16 (wanted to hold off on treatment until after 2nd vaccine dose). Headache continued & began to worsen. I thought maybe due to prednisone or high blood pressure from prednisone? Visit to PCP on 1/25 due persistent headache that was not resolving (Headache was vice-like, pain moderate to severe, headache worse with exertion or bending over). 1/25 ""worst headache of my life"". MRI ordered & completed 1/27; MRI normal other than sinusitis. Visit to ENT on 1/28; she said sinusitis improving & prescribed Norco for headache pain. Visit to PCP on 1/30; he prescribed Gabapentin & Naproxen for headache pain. Visit to Naturopath on 2/4; recommended adding Magnesium & B Vitamin Complex. 2/5: Massage with worsening headache pain. 2/10: Chiropractor & Acupuncturist with worsening headache pain. 2/19: Visit to Urgent Care for Toradol shot & Cyclobenzaprine prescribed. 2/23: Visit with Neurology; prescribed Topamax & Prednisone. 3/5: felt strange sensations in body, wave like feeling over limbs, tension in skull, heart pounding, change of hearing, menthol sensation on skin, change of taste, worsening headache, warm feeling in chest & abdomen, lasts 1-2 minutes. 3/6: ED visit due to strange episode/sensations; Neurologist on call prescribed Fioricet & Nortriptyline. 3/9: visit to Neurology, she increased metoprolol to 50mg, injected Ajovy, prescribed more cyclobenzaprine & ordered MRI/MRV. Headache pain continued to be moderate to severe, constant & ""nervy"", episodes continued to occur daily. 3/12: bloodwork to check inflammation. 3/14: MRI/MRV completed. Headache worsened with MRI noise & injection of contrast. 3/16: lumbar puncture completed w/ normal pressure, awaiting CSF labs. Discontinued Topamax 3/21; thought maybe contributing to episodes. More bloodwork completed 3/24. Visit to PCP, given Nurtec sample with some relief. Otherwise, headache remains daily & persistent with little/no relief overall. Head pain is bilateral, vice-like, burning sensation @ times on skull or face, numbness & tingling both sides of face periodically. Headache worsens with activity & at night.

They appear almost to have a pinhead sized pus in them. At the 36 hr mark, it remains the same in discomfort, but there are more hives and it has spread out by three inches across the chest and is halfway up to the neck. The rash does not improve or spread further and remains the same at the 4.5 day mark today.   2. Around day 1.5 or 2, a mucusy film fills throat making it necessary to constantly clear my throat in an almost violent way order to feel comfortable. It feels like there is lots of post nasal drip in my throat, however, I have completely clear sinuses. Sometimes this means coughing though I would not say I have a cough.   3. I need to use my inhailer in my car on Sunday, day 3.5 to breathe deeply. This is very unusual. I have shortness of breath and deep wheezing more than usual.   4.

I feel like if I let my eyes close at 3pm, which they feel like doing, I would fall asleep. This continues day 4. Ironically, I have trouble sleeping. ..  5. Day 4.5, Myalgias, see above. And skin also feels fender in spots. ..  6. Today started a general unease, day 4,. I had this with Covid. It is hard to explain.

I am familiar with vertigo from ear infections in the past (last one about 15 years ago and the one prior about 22 years ago).  For me vertigo is a generally mild sensation that stays with me until it clears up.  This was, and is, much different, it ebbs and increases during the day, if I concentrate on a physical task it sort of diminishes, then comes back, at times it goes away completely for an hour or two then comes back strong.  At same time that this started my thoughts and mental acuity started to suffer kind of a ""brain fog"" is the best explanation I can give.  I also have a slight headache at the back of my head wrapping around to the temples, I don't know if I can link the headache to the brain fog since my neck often gives me trouble.  I have ruled out ear infection by purposefully spinning myself around to see if I would lose balance, did not affect my balance.

Medical history included very sensitive to medication effects (usually takes only 1/2 dose with strong efficacy to avoid side effects). Breast cancer survivor (2014 onset, 2019 declared permanent remission) and mild blood pressure treated successfully with medication for about 10 years. Concomitant medications included spironolactone and valsartan, both taken for blood pressure. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 16Jan2021 in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The reporter's mother died 3 weeks and 6 days after having received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The cause of death was a ""widow maker"" type heart attack where the LAD artery suddenly became 100% blocked by a blood clot; the event began about 11:45pm on 04Mar2021. The blockage was confirmed via cardiac cath procedure performed within 2 hours of the onset by Doctor, he removed the clot and placed a stent. However her heart was too damaged and could not recover. Doctor confirmed to us that she did not have excessive or evidence of any prior blockage and not excessive plaque. The blood clot likely came on and caused the cardiac event within roughly an hour, he explained. The patient had no prior symptoms and no comorbidities for blood clotting and was full of life and energy on 05Mar up to when she went to bed that night. She died 06Mar at 4:04 am at hospital. The strat date of the events was reported as 04Mar2021 at 11:45 PM. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient died on 06Mar2021. An autopsy was not performed. The death cause: Triggered by the sudden 100% blockage of the LAD by a blood clot, the cause of death is listed as (A) Cardiogenic shock (B) Anterior myocardial infarction. Treatment was received for the events which included multiple resuscitations and angioplasty surgery. No covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination.

The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender's Comments: Based on available information a contributory  of BNT162B2 to the reported neutropenia  cannot  be totally excluded.  The reported  premature closure of the ductus arteriosus with severe right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arterial pressures are unrelated to BNT162B2.  The premature closure of the ductus arteriosus is a developmental complication and the  right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arterial pressures are probably due to the premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

Since the whelp persisted for numerous days the patient reached out the medical colleges for advice. Eventually in late January she sought the opinion of a dermatologist since the area of concern had not improved. The dermatologist was unsure if this reaction was caused by the vaccine but did  prescribe steroids to help with redness/swelling. Despite steroids the area did not improve. On a repeat visit to the dermatologist in late February a tissue sample of the whelp was taken and sent off for analysis. The analysis returned back as squamous cell carcinoma.

Her bed is 15' from her bed, and could not get back and forth and was stumbling and exhausted from that small distance.  She could not hold her head up, and had to stay in the bathroom to get enough energy to get back to the bed, and could not get her feet up to get back in the bed due to being winded and exhausted as well.  This went on for a couple of days.  She did not eat, but nothing was staying down.  She had chills, was wrapped up in quilts, cold, and her hips, knees and ankles felt like somebody was pulling her apart.  On Sunday she started to begin feeling better, was light sensitive, almost a migraine type headache, sensitive to sound, and lost track of time.  She is still having some of the symptoms, the worst has passed, but still feels disoriented, dizziness.  Her right arm has a buzzy feeling on the upper and lower arm, both hands are very swollen, the right more so than the left.  Her fingertips were going numb on her right arm, but not on the left where she got the vaccine.  She would have to rub them to get the feeling to come back.  She is very shaky very easily, and if she turns too fast she will get dizzy.  For the stomach she normally takes Pantoprazole and her roommate got her some generic Omeprazole which calmed her stomach down and has been finishing up that bottle, but it was still not feeling well.  She never ran any fever, but never runs a fever, and took her temp a few days ago was 97.8 which is normal for her.  She has called her doctor and then called her again yesterday and missed her return call and will speak with her today.",,,,,,,,,N,03/18/2021,03/19/2021,1,None.,PHM,,"Centrum silver, vitamin E, Cymbalta, Losartan, Propranolol, Pantoprazole.",None.,"High blood pressure, depression, GERD.",,,2,03/30/2021,,,,"Codeine, Demerol,  Flexeril.

Awoke at 12:30 am feeling that every cell in my body had frozen; my skin was encasing glaciers of ice that were bumping around each other, causing great pain with every movement. I was surprised to hear myself gasping. I was looking at the scene inside my body. The frozen tension in my body, cell to cell, was crippling. Could not move. I kept appealing to my cells to relax, relax, relieve the tension and the ice would melt.  Despite many down jackets, blankets, heating pad, could not warm. Extreme pain everywhere. Got sicker and sicker throughout the day, (super dizzy), fell twice on my back, fever soared. Fuzzy thinking. Threw up all day Tuesday. Very loose uncontrollable bowel. Friend  who is working here (renovating the apartment) got Tylenol, etc for me. The second time I fell I couldn?t get up and lay on the floor for over an hour until friend reappeared and gently helped me rise and return to couch. I could not even attempt going back to my bed on the other side of the houseand have been in the office couch since Monday evening. Have continued with wearing 2 sweaters, down jacket for the last 24 hours plus blankets and heating pad. Called doc who said this is ?normal? but my condition is much more ?dramatic?. If not better today (Tuesday) to get to emergency, but this am fever is down and I am able to walk a bit. Dizzy headaches and difficulty walking continued for another week and a half.

I understand that fever, muscle aches and head aches are possible side effects of vaccinations in general and this one in particular.  Since I had tested positive for antibodies for the third time just two weeks prior to receiving this first dose of Moderna I was anticipating some reactions similar to what I have heard people experiencing for their second shot.  What followed the initial onset of fever was the worst flu symptoms I have ever experienced in my 48 years.  Fever continued to increase reaching 103 if not higher at times and staying elevated at level for over 6 hours.  Chills to the point of convulsions.  Nausea and one time vomiting.  Fever dreams (mild hallucinations), profuse sweating, intense head aches.  Muscle aches I could barely tolerate that I felt over every inch of my body.  This continued until 10am the following morning when I took some advil and finally fell asleep to the point of being virtually unwakeable until 2:30pm.  Upon waking I was able to sit up and drink water but the muscle soreness and slight fever continued throughout the day (101 fever).   I was able to eat some toast that evening.  That night the fever returned but not as high as the previous night.  The sweating was still profuse throughout the night and the muscle aches continued  but to a lessor degree.  The following day the fever subsided though muscle soreness continued.  That evening I was able to sleep regularly and now today (three full days after vaccination) I am roughly back to myself.  I understand that reading this seems as if these symptoms fall in line with what is expected and understand to be the side effects of the vaccine.  I am here today to tell you that I thought I was dying.  I have never, ever felt so terrible ever.  It was ten times worse than having covid.

1147644,03/30/2021,AZ,46.0,46,,F,,"I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn't know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I'd never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I've never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn't hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I'd have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn't sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn't raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a ""nerve-type"" pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn't sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn't want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn't take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn't go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it's related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that's a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I've captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn't gotten back to normal.",,,,,,,,,N,03/24/2021,03/24/2021,0,I spoke to my doctor 3/29/21 and the person.,UNK,,"Vitamin D, bio-identical progesterone 110mg",None,Post-menopausal; depression,,vsafe,2,03/30/2021,,,,Penicillin; Sulfa

I slept around 7.30 pm and got up at 7 am. I felt weakness and after I had my break fast , my body pains started. Every muscle ached and every joint ached. I had weakness and lethargy. I took tyelenol extra strength so the pain was subsiding . I had temperature 100.3 since Fri , Mar 25th. When the tyelenol was wearing off the pains used to become horrible. I was not able to move and I was on my bed bed most of the time. On 28th I even tried Ibuprofen as Tyelenol was not helping a lot with pains but Ibuprofen did not work at all. I sent messages to my dr who thought these side effects are expected. On Mon she replied if the side effects did not resolve I can go to Immediate Care. My arm was sore but that soreness was nothing compared to body aches I had. I called off from work on Fri and Sat. My employer wanted return to work clearance. I went to discuss with Immediate care doctor as I had same weakness and tiredness and little walking was making me breathe heavily. As it was almost the end of 4th day after I got my vaccine they tested me for Covid and my results were negative.  I still have to be in quarantine for 7 days from yesterday.  I was tested Covid positive in Mar 2020 around mar 24th. I had same horrible pains but had high temperature like 1049.8 and with tyelenol it was 102.5. I am scared to take the second dose that might trigger same reaction. I suffered a lot like people suffered after 2nd dose.

I promptly directed the patient to sit down, but before she was able to reach a chair, she collapsed entirely. She fully regained consciousness within a few seconds and was alert to presence, place, and time. PT was able to seat herself at this point.  Her blood pressure registered 82/51 mmHg immediately after the episode. PT was visually slowed and confused, but was otherwise fully present. PT was given water and allowed to recover in a seated position.  Blood pressure registered at 117/71 mmHg 15 minutes later, and PT reported feeling much better. PT was visually much more alert and cognitively present. After 15 minutes of no change in condition, patient was allowed to leave facility with the accompaniment of her mother.

The patient received her first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 2/26/21. The patient apparently reported itching within 10 minutes and within 20 minutes she developed mild lips and tongue swelling. No breathing difficulty noted. The patient reported taking Benadryl liquid with relief of her symptoms. No Epi Pen was administered. On 3/3/21, the patient was seen by the Immunologist for evaluation as the patient requested to receive her second dose despite potential risk for another allergic reaction. The immunologist recommended to patient's primary care provider to premedicate the patient 1 hour prior to 2nd dose of Moderna with specific instructions for the vaccine to be administered at the Emergency Department. Another option was for the patient not to get the second dose of Moderna and wait for a different vaccine. The patient informed her primary care provider that she wants the 2nd dose administered. On 3/26/21, the patient premedicated herself as instructed from home with fexofenadine 180mg, diphenhydramine 50mg, famotidine 40mg, and prednisone 20mg prior to her 2nd dose of the vaccine. Patient received her second dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine around 3:09 pm at the Emergency Department (ED) area. After 15 minutes, the patient had facial swelling and was immediately given Epi Pen in left thigh. Patient was checked in to the ED. Thirty minutes later, the patient experienced itching and redness in her right forearm, headaches, tingling of her lips and face, then found her tongue swelling with difficulty opening her mouth. The patient received her 2nd dose of the Epi Pen in addition to diphenhydramine IV and IV methylprednisolone (steroid). She was later transferred to MICU for further monitoring due to potential airway compromise. The patient was admitted to MICU on 3/26/21. Covid-19 negative. She was transferred to acute care ward on 3/27/21 for additional monitoring of her angioedema. As of 3/29/21, the patient is in a stable condition. Per hospitalist, patient's facial swelling has gradually improved and remains on iv steroid treatment.

2189374,03/30/2021,MI,,,,F,,"I am writing in regards to the online form. I attempted to file one online and after filling it out  on the website something  happened that caused me to lose the entire form. I believe that my wife of 34 years passed away on Saturday March 13 2021 from a reaction to the Moderna vaccine 1st dose (010A21A), she was vaccinated on Friday Feb 26 2021 and started showing signs of a reaction on Sunday Feb 28 2021. My wife was having a fever, chills and a headache all of the signs that we were told could happen as her body was building immunity, and how it is considered a good sign. My wife was not a person who complained about pain or discomfort. My wife had worked at the same place since 1989 and had called in ""sick"" maybe 5 or 6 times including this issue, so she thought something wasn't right. I am not saying that the vaccine ""caused any new medical issues"" but I do believe that something in it may have interacted with a previously unknown issue. Unfortunately someone is not allowed to just believe something is wrong and has to follow procedure with regards to the Insurance companies and the type of care you receive and how to get it. After a couple of days of the symptoms, late Wednesday night March 3 2021 she called a 24 Nurse hotline sponsored by our Insurance and was told to take Tylenol because she was probably having a reaction and was building immunity and to call her Dr. in the morning and she did call Thursday March 4 2021 and was basically told the same thing to take Tylenol as she was probably just having a reaction and building immunity. Saturday March 6 2021 she was wondering if she actually did have COVID and went to an Urgent Care and had the 15 minute  test and also the 24 hour test the results came Saturday for the 15 test and Sunday for the 24 hour test both were negative. Monday morning she called her Dr and he said that maybe she had Pneumonia and ordered an antibiotic and ordered a chest X-ray. I picked up the prescription and the order. Tuesday March 8 2021 my wife had the chest X-ray and Wednesday she received the results and that was negative. My wife asked to speak to the Dr. and he was supposed to call her when he could. Thursday March 9 2021 my wife went to work and they sent her home which shows how she was. Her Dr called and said to go to the ER I dropped her at the ER and went home because her Mother lives with us and has dementia and and other medical concerns and cannot be alone for long periods. We had agreed to let her live with us because between the two of us we could manage her care, me during the day and my wife after work. Now it is me alone and my wife was ""our"" only source of income and insurance besides being my ""everything"" 34 years wasn't long enough and I am sorry that this is not the right place fo that but this is personally very hard on me. My wife texted me and said that they told her she had an infection and they were going to admit her. I visited her Thursday night and she was still having the fever, chills and headaches. I went home and later she texted me after I went to bed said she was hot and asked if we could we talk in the morning and what I didn't know was after I left someone came in and told her that her Dr. thought she might have a heart problem. My wife never told me so as not to worry but that was what she wanted to talk about which I found out Friday. Friday March 10 2021 1 received a phone call that my wife had complained of chest pains and they were taking her to the Heart Catheterization Lab and asked if I wanted to be there and I said that I couldn't because her mother was not awake and hadn't been fed or had any of her medication yet. After taking care of everything I called the Hospital and they said she was already in for the procedure. I received a phone call from the Dr who performed the procedure and he said she had a 100% blockage on one artery and a thickened wall of her heart that was probably hereditary and also a leaky valve but they were going look at that Monday March 15 2021 I called to speak to my wife and was told that she had to lie flat until 10:30 am because of what was done. She called me and said that she felt like she had been run over but was okay, while we were talking my wife told me what the Dr had said about maybe her having a heart problem. My wife said she had to go because someone came in to do something and she would call me later. I received a call from the nurse who said my wife had been light-headed and that her blood pressure was low and her heart rate was too high and they were going to put an IV in her neck to better control the drugs to regulate both of them. They wanted the heart rate lower and her blood pressure higher. I visited her later Friday night and she looked good all things considered we talked and I had to go home to care for her mother. Saturday March 13 20211 called to speak to her and she didn't answer so I called to speak to the nurse but was told she would call me back, I waited for about an hour and went to the Hospital.

A 53-year-old female subject received the first dose of blinded vaccine therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) on 14Aug2020 at 11:33 and the second dose on 04Sep2020 at 13:13, both via intramuscular (IM) in the left deltoid as single doses for immunization. The subject's medical history includes ongoing chronic migraines (from 2008); neck pain since 2008 with temporary relief from chiropractic manipulation; osteopenia; vitamin D deficiency (2013 to 2014) controlled with Vit D supplements until now; Vit B12 deficiency. In 2014, the subject was diagnosed with occipital neuralgia, right greater than left. She got a steroid injection and did a one-month oral steroid taper, both without relief. She declined to try gabapentin, pregabalin (LYRICA) or other neuropathic pain medications. In addition, the  chronic migraines occur 1-2 times per month requiring multiple therapeutic interventions (including B2/Mg, doxepin, zolmitriptan (ZOMIG) as needed (PRN)) and had an episode of intractable chronic migraines without aura and status migrainosus treated with botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX) in 2016. She had experienced relief with botulinum toxin type A and zolmitriptan. Per neurology visit on 01Mar2016, the subject did not feel a typical aura for the migraines, she may have some scalp tenderness or neuralgia-like feeling. She had never had a complicated migraine. Subject's family medical history relevant to adverse event was none. The subject had no concomitant vaccines or prior vaccines (within 4 weeks). Concomitant medication included zolmitriptan for migraines from 2008, vitamin D from 2013 as supplement, both ongoing. On 20Oct2020, the subject started experiencing right leg paresthesia, which required a visit to the physician's office and was considered as an important medical event. On 28Oct2020  the subject underwent a nasal/sinus surgery after which she was given codeine phosphate/paracetamol for three days. On 02Nov2020, she had lower back pain and bilateral lower extremities pain including a shooting ""patchy"" pain, worse on the right side. Her legs and parietal scalp were sensitive to touch with an associated burning pain. She also reported tenderness in bilateral inguinal area. Symptoms had a gradual onset approximately 3 weeks before. Subject had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her back which appeared ""ok"" but she had not seen her primary care physician (PCP) or a neurologist. She denied a history of neurologic or lower back problems. Investigator had a follow-up on 10Nov2020. The paresthesia and skin sensitivity on head had improved but not resolved. Subject still required use of analgesic daily. At its worst, her pain was 6-7/10 in severity. When symptoms started, pain severity was 8-9/10 for a couple of weeks. Without use of analgesic, she had significantly decreased level of activity. But the pain did not prevent activity. With analgesics, she was able to function adequately despite persistence of a mild constant pain of lower back and legs which rates as 1-2/10 in severity. She had required use of some form of analgesic since pain started on approximately 20Oct2020. She had used paracetamol (TYLENOL), ibuprofen (ADVIL), codeine phosphate/paracetamol (TYLENOL#3), and most recently celecoxib (CELEBREX). She said the pain started on approximately 20Oct2020 but then said it started closer to 5 weeks after vaccination 2. She had not noticed any exacerbating factors. Subject denied any recent injury, travel, infection, or change in diet. She went for a walk on 10Nov2020 and walked approximately one mile without a problem. She stopped walking by choice not due to pain. Initially, adverse event was not reported since there was no official diagnosis and symptoms were believed to have occurred approximately six weeks after second vaccination. Despite still not having an official diagnosis, investigator had opted to report this as an important medical event since symptoms had persisted and the subject believed they started closer to five weeks after vaccination which was close to the four week post-vaccination observation period. Medical records from the neurologist were obtained. Per the note from 06Nov2020, MRI of cervical spine done several years before showed mild degenerative changes and spondylosis. MRI of lumbar spine recently done by subject showed: ""degenerative discopathy, small left central disc protrusion at T5-T6 with minimal indentation thecal sac; No spinal cord compression, spinal canal stenosis or neural foramina narrowing; Multilevel hypertrophic changes of the facets within the lumbar spine with no neural foramina stenosis; Incidental finding multilevel small hemangiomas in cervical and thoracic vertebral bodies."" Neurologic exam on 06Nov2020 was normal Including gait and tandem walk. Tenderness was noted in lower extremities musculature bilaterally throughout and large mobile inguinal lymph nodes palpable bilaterally. Lab ordered by neurologist were normal including Vit B12 635 (200-960PG/ML), Folate 19.6 (equal and more than 6.0UG/L), Vit D 25-Hydroxy 33 (30-100NG/ML), Total creatine phosphokinase (CK) 45 (28-176U/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 15 (0-20MM/HR), C-Reactive Protein 0.3 (less than 0.5MG/DL), serum aldolase 3.9 (1.5-7.2U/L), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.130 (0.400-4.100UIU/ML), FREE T4 1.42 (0.80-1.90 NG/DL), lyme antibody 0.25 (Negative less than 0.9), antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative; serum protein electrophoresis normal, no monoclonal protein seen. Neurologist impression included possible post-viral syndrome or an autoimmune process. There was no mention of concern for myelitis or plan for further work-up. Neurologist's recommendation was to continue celecoxib, PRN and follow-up with primary care physician if labs were unrevealing. Plan to have subject return to clinic to obtain more in-depth history and possibly some labs as well as request reports of MRIs. On 01Mar2021, the subject was seen for visit4, it was confirmed that the event was ongoing but continuing to improve. The action taken for blinded vaccine therapy in response to the event was not applicable. The outcome of the event was recovering.  The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event ""right leg paresthesia"" was related to blinded vaccine therapy (temporal relationship only, possible due to no other obvious potential etiologies), but unrelated to concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.  On 18Nov2020, the blinded code was broken due to serious, related, unexpected event.  Follow-up (10Dec2020): This is a follow-up report based on the receipt of the publication: No new information provided.  Follow-up (23Mar2021): New reported information included: clinical course (on visit4, confirmed that the event was ongoing but continuing to improve).; Sender's Comments: The event Paresthesia Lower Limb is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162;PLACEBO).   There is not a reasonable possibility for the event paresthesia lower limb to be related with the blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO). As an individual case report, there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the study vaccine apart from a chronological association at this time of the report. Based on the information currently available, it is more likely that the event is associated with the subject's underlying known neurological conditions.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

He got home that night and read the headline in the (Withheld) times that said several European countries are pulling the Astra Zeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots even though there has not been any causal relationship found.

He is at home and he would say his only concern is that he does have hemorrhoids so when he has bowel movement tomorrow, because he doesn't go every day, but when he goes he is concerned if he starts to bleed that the anti-coagulant might cause the bleeding to be more significant than it usually is.

They stayed so heavy that I had to lift my legs off the chair to get up and walk and then they were heavy to move.  I developed a headache as well.  I did not feel I needed medical attention but I do remember feeling the exact same way AFTER my heart surgery in 2013.  I remember telling the ICU nurse back then that I felt like I had sand bags attached to all my limbs, and her response was it was due to my cells being bounced around in the heart lung machine and it would go away over time as my cells healed.  So I am thinking this vaccine messed with my cells doing what ever it is doing and has cause damage to my cells causing me the fatigue and thickness as I experienced after my surgery.    as I write this I am better, the symptoms have gone but not completely, I feel I will need a few days to recover from this.

Once I laid down, the attention of the volunteers and nurses was on me. Three came over to assist me. They held my legs up,  kept a hand on my wrist for a pulse, and fetched water. I talked myself through the dizziness and ringing in my ears. They put a cold rag on my forehead and had smelling salts on hand. Once I began to feel better, they helped me slowly sit up, and eventually helped me stand up and get into a chair.

A pulse oximeter was placed on her left pointer finger.  Her heart rate fluctuated in the 110s to 130s during the encounter.  Her pulse ox remained 97% throughout the encounter.  Patient reported having a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril.  We placed a blood pressure monitor on her left wrist to take her blood pressure.  Her initial blood pressure was 164/105, which she reported was ""just a little bit over normal"" for her.  After taking the initial blood pressure, she described that her symptoms were beginning to subside a bit.  We discussed the signs/symptoms that we would be looking for in an anaphylaxis type reaction, some of which were present (i.e. tachycardia, dyspnea) and some of which were not (i.e. hives, swelling of the face/lips, throat, etc.).  We then began to take her blood pressure again.  The second blood pressure measurement was 156/104.  Shortly after taking the second blood pressure, she described having feelings of dyspnea again.  At that time, I notified another staff member to contact EMS/call 911 and let them know we potentially had an allergic reaction to the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
