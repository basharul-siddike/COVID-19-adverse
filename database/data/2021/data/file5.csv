There was no harm to the patient as a result of the error. The error occurred on 1/11/2021 during the hospital's vaccination of co-workers for COVID-19. The co-worker in this report was vaccinated with a syringe containing air only and no actual vaccine. How the error occurred a first-time volunteer from critical care transport was assisting at the hospital's vaccine clinic with vaccine preparation and was observed correctly drawing up doses from the first vial. Error occurred when the volunteer drew up doses from the second vial. The volunteer drew up air only and no vaccine. How the error was discovered? An administrator thought the syringe felt strange and did not contain any vaccine. The error was discovered at that point. Investigation found that the volunteer had drawn up a total of 6 doses that contained air instead of vaccine and were dispensed for administration. Four vaccine syringes containing only air (and no vaccine) were recovered unused. Two vaccine syringes containing air (and no vaccine) had reached patients. This patient received one of the affected syringes but had already left the vaccine clinic when the error was discovered. She was told to return to vaccine clinic and receive a correctly prepared dose. Pt returned on 1/13 and got her dose [in left arm, Lot EL3248 1/13 0857].

The next day my temp had gone up to over 103, and they told me the same thing.  At some point between the 19th and 20th of Sept, my temperature was 105.8.  This was WITH ibuprofen.  I was very concerned but also couldn't move. I was home alone.   I remember thinking I should go to an ER, and getting cold washcloths for my head. I also told my son to get another thermometer, in case ours was broken.  He came home from school, got me a new thermometer and verified that my temp indeed had gone up to 106.  The arm where the shot had been administered was swollen, but I couldn't tell if there were hives.   I do not remember much else.  My son called my spouse who looked up how much more tylenol or ibuprofen I could take, and I believe I was given more.  I have no memory of Sept 21st,  and half of Sept 20th.

Dad's reported that pt had a fever of 100.6 F (max temp) and hard stools. Pt was given a dose of Tylenol and 10-15 minutes later, pt vomited. Triage nurse advised that dad follow up with PCP office when open in the AM.  Dad called our office at 10:25am on 12/21/2020 stating that pt fever had lifted, but pt vomited a total of 5 times since the night before, with the last episode at 7:45 am on 12/21/2020. Pt had adequate fluid intake and urine output and stool had softened. MA advised continued home care. Appropriate triage advice was given and documented. At 16:43(pm) on 12/21/20, dad called back to clinic stating patient symptoms had worsened and they were at the emergency department. Dad disconnected call before speaking with the MA. The MA attempted to call dad back, but there was no answer. A message was left for dad to return call. On 12/22/20 at 12:44(pm), dad called in to clinic to report that pt had died- cause unknown. Our clinic obtained records from Hospital. The ED report stated that pt presented to the emergency department via EMS Code 3 in cardiac arrest. Unknown downtime prior to the initiation of chest compressions. Pt was staying with grandparents. When grandma went to wake pt from his nap, he was not responsive. When grandma tried to pick him up, there was possibly some brief, generalized seizure activity as well as coughing and gagging. Child remained unresponsive and was taken by private vehicle to outside Urgent Care where pt was found to be apneic and in asystole. An AED was applied, no shock advised. EMS was called and CPR was started. EMS placed an endotracheal tube and established IO access. 4 rounds of epinephrine were administered during the course of the prehospital resuscitation which was approximately 15-20 minutes. Presenting rhythm was asystole. No change in rhythm upon transport and arrival. Immediately upon arrival the pediatric transport team was activated and the pediatric intensivist was paged. Chest compressions were resumed according to protocol. Additional inter osseous access was established in the left proximal tibia. Fluid bolus was initiated. Serial doses of epinephrine were administered every 4 minutes throughout the resuscitation. The child also received several boluses of IV bicarb. Online consultation by ED physician with PICU attending was established early in the resuscitation course. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that the peds transport team would be dispatched urgently to the ED location in anticipation of possible ROSC and need for emergent transport to PICU. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that transportation would not be initiated with the child still undergoing resuscitation requiring chest compressions prior to ROSC. Initially, endotracheal tube position felt to be acceptable based on the clinical evaluation, however chest x-ray did demonstrate some degree of right mainstem intubation, after which the tube was pulled back approx 2cm and subsequent x-ray showed the ETT tip in good position approx 1 cm above the carina.  Initial end-tidal CO2 was 14 on arrival, this continued to trend downward until undetectable throughout the course of the resuscitation. At no point were there palpable pulses or other evidence of return of circulation throughout the resuscitation. Capillary blood glucose was initially undetectable. The child received serial boluses of D 25 via IO line for a tital of 30 g dextrose after which CBG ultimately came up to 244. Multiple efforts were made throughout the resuscitation to achieve IV access and to obtain blood for laboratory studies. All efforts were unsuccessful, making it impossible to obtain any labs throughout the course of the resuscitation. Attempts to obtain even capillary blood samples via heel stick for CBG measurements were extremely difficult. Resuscitation continued for 49 minutes after ED arrival. A total of at least 65 minutes of CPR time. Bedside ultrasound was used to look for cardiac activity during the last 5 pulse checks of the resuscitation, demonstrating cardiac standstill. Despite the efforts and interventions mentioned, ROSC was never obtained and the code was discontinued at 17:03(pm). The child's parents were informed of his death upon their arrival to the ED at approximately 17:40(pm). Family was given time with the pt. The medical examiner arrived and discussed case at 19:11(pm). At 19:49(pm) Medical Examiner was interviewing grandparents along with 2 County Detectives. The medical examiner took custody of the pt at 21:52(pm). Evidence bag was sent with the medical examiner.  Pt received vaccinations 10 days prior to death.

It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can't fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area.

He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.   REASON FOR ADMISSION/ ADMISSION DIAGNOSES   Sepsis cause unclear",,,,,Y,11,,,N,01/06/2021,01/06/2021,0,"1/7/21: XR chest 1 view: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of pancreatic tail due to overlying bowel gas.  The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is difficult to differentiate from surrounding retroperitoneal fat.  The pancreatic duct is top normal caliber at 3 mm. Unremarkable liver. Slightly distended gallbladder containing thickened partially congealed bile.  No calcified stones.  No sonographic evidence of cholecystitis. The extrahepatic ducts measure up to 8 mm, normal for patient's age. Stable septated right side renal cyst compared to 2018. Troponin I: 0.08 Bilirubin Direct: 0.91 Blood Culture:  Salmonella  Gram Stain: gram negative Rods LDH: 292 WBC: 19.24 1/8/21: lower limb venous duplex study, complete bilateral: CONCLUSION: Impression: RIGHT LOWER LIMB: No evidence of acute or chronic deep vein thrombosis. No evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis noted. LEFT LOWER LIMB: No evidence of acute or chronic deep vein thrombosis. No evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis noted.  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute intra-abdominal abnormality. 2. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis but no discernible pericholecystic inflammatory changes.  There is a tiny calcification in the porta hepatis near the base of the gallbladder, relationship to ductal structures cannot be determined on  noncontrast imaging although could potentially be vascular. There does not appear to be intrahepatic duct dilatation.  3. 1 cm indeterminate right renal nodule.   4. Possible small pancreatic cysts. 5. Colonic diverticulosis without focal diverticulitis. 6.  Mild splenomegaly. 7. Trace abdominal ascites. Although contrast imaging is preferential to evaluate the parenchymal organs, patient has impaired renal function, and noncontrast MRCP may still provide additional information regarding parenchymal organs and ductal structure findings as described. Limited study without IV contrast. 1/9/21 XR knee 1 or 2 vw right IMPRESSION: No acute osseous abnormality. Degenerative changes as described 1/11/21 XR chest portable IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 1/12/21 MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST WITH MRCP IMPRESSION: Dominant 2.2 cm stone in the gallbladder neck with prominent distention of the gallbladder but without gallbladder wall thickening.  Trace nonspecific pericholecystic fluid in this patient with trace perihepatic and upper abdominal ascites as well as  mesenteric and retroperitoneal edema. No choledocholithiasis.  Borderline common duct.  Minor prominence of central intrahepatic biliary tree. Multiple cystic pancreatic lesions most consistent with intraductal papillary mucinous pancreatic neoplasm.  The largest these measures up to 21 mm in the pancreatic head.  No main pancreatic ductal enlargement. Based on institutional consensus and  recent literature gastroenterology consult and/or surgical oncology consult is recommended.  By these criteria, endoscopic ultrasound is likely warranted. Considerations related to the patient's age and/or comorbidities may be used to alter these  recommendations.",PVT,,"Medication List As of 1/6/2021 11:25 AM  amLODIPine Besylate 5 mg Oral  Apixaban 5 mg Oral 2 times daily  Aspirin 81 mg Oral Daily  Cholecalciferol 10,000 Units Oral 2 times weekly  cloNIDine HCl 0.1 mg/day Transdermal Weekly  Clopidogrel B",,?

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn't often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn't have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn't want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times.

I took a Benadryl hoping just a mild reaction that would clear up. Next morning my feet and hands woke me up from the tingling and cramping. Other symptoms off and on were spasms in my feet and pain in index and middle fingers when touching cold. I called my doctor on Monday morning to get in for an appointment after I was awakened with some cramping in my calves and was more concerned. Was told if it worsened or I had any SOB or weakness in extremities to go to the ER. My reflexes were checked and normal and no weakness in my muscles. No other tests done at that time.

Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) formally diagnosed around Jan2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported he got the COVID-19 Vaccine at 06:15 on 29Dec2020 and had to sit for 15 minutes afterwards before he could leave. He said everything was fine, and he walked out to the hospital lobby, and was speaking with a work associate for 10 minutes before he headed to his car. When he got ready to leave, he got in his car, and started his car. He started driving home, and realized he was in AFIB. He did have an AFIB issue. His AFIB has been pretty well controlled for a year now, as long as, he didn't do something stupid. He had a moderately aggressive run of AFIB. He said his ""smart"" watch told him his heart rate was 117. His normal heart rate is around 60-70. He was in AFIB for about 3 hours. His typical runs of AFIB are considerably shorter. He only had a total of 2 episodes of AFIB in the last year. His prior AFIB episodes would have been about 4-5 minutes. The last time he had AFIB that lasted any length of time was when he was hospitalized for AFIB around Jan2020. He said at that time, he was hospitalized overnight for observation. He received medication during the hospitalization and his AFIB broke. He didn't remember what medications were given to him during the hospitalization. He said he had flutters before that hospitalization, but the flutters were always gone after a few minutes, so he never sought treatment because there would be nothing to treat. The patient reported he noticed the rest of the day on 29Dec2020, right up to going to bed that he felt cold. His house wasn't cold, and he didn't have a fever. He said the cold feeling went away during the night while he was sleeping. He said the cold feeling easily lasted for a 12 hours. He said the cold feeling could have been something else.

0944598,01/14/2021,IA,29.0,29,,F,,"1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present ""low back strain"" lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn't 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R>L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R>L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  ""STIR signal abnormality"" within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial ""normal"" results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep' she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn't done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn't been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn't thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I'm unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I'm hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.",,,,,,,,,N,01/07/2021,01/08/2021,1,"see continuation page EXAM: MRI LUMBAR SPINE W/O CONTRAST    INDICATION: ACUTE BILATERAL LOW BACK PAIN WITH BILATERAL SCIATICA    TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the lumbar spine without intravenous contrast.

By 9 PM, I had itchy redness across my entire chest. I went to sleep. The next morning, it had seemed to clear up slightly. By 4-6 PM 1/9/21, the rash had increased to cover my entire abdomen, with itchiness and redness. I contacted my supervisor at the hospital and also utilized telehealth to discuss the situation with a physician. He advised me to take Benadryl and issued a prescription for prednisone to clear the rash. He also advised me to take an allergy medication such as Claritin the next morning. I took Benadryl and although the redness stayed, the itchy sensation greatly decreased. I went to sleep roughly 3-4 hours after Benadryl administration (around 11-12 PM). I also went to the hospital for a COVID-19 test that evening on the recommendation of my employer. at 1:30 AM on 1/10/21, I woke to find the rash had covered 90 percent of my body (every part of me except for my face) and I was exceedingly itchy. I took an additional dose of Benadryl and fell back asleep. I woke at 8:30 AM 1/10/21 and the rash was entirely gone. I felt slightly itchy, so I took one additional dose of Benadryl. I have not had any additional doses of Benadryl, redness/rash, or itchiness since that time. I have overall felt well otherwise. I have not had a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. I have perhaps been slightly more tired than usual. I received notification of a negative COVID-19 test at 9:30 PM on 1/11/21. I returned to work the next day.

I have also quoted it below because the tablets we have on site will not allow me to type in those areas of the PDF.  The adverse reaction occurred around 12:45 pm on 01/06/2021.  Symptoms ceased within 3 hours after visit.  On follow up, she said her symptoms felt like indigestion and anxiety.  Thank you for your time and understanding. The note is as follows, Vaccine recipient came to the vaccination site at 12:45.  She informed us of her medical history. She had one instance of anaphylactic shock as a baby. She has not had a reaction since. She has an allergy to latex, and two others that are no longer viewable in database. No one on site has access to her file now that she has successfully been vaccinated,  so the following history was obtained  from patient verbally.  I did verify that she is not allergic to polyethylene glycol.  Recipient has taken miralax before with no reaction.  This morning before arrival,  recipient took her normal dose of levothyroxine,  and mesalamine.  She also took one lorazepam before her appointment to treat the anxiety she was feeling leading up to her vaccination. She ate a normal amount for her,  including nuts,  crackers and three 16 oz bottles of water. Before her injection,  medic reviewed all medical history and allergies.  We discussed risks,  and  the expected positive outcome of getting the moderna vaccine.  She verbalized her anxiety,  but attested that she very much wanted the vaccine.  After vaccination,  recipient was speaking clearly, feeling okay,  and she was instructed to wait for 30 minutes of observation.  She told personnel on site that she was having chest pain.  She pointed to her sternum describing a 3/10 pain that felt like pressure.  She said it radiated to her right breast.  She said it felt like indigestion,  and she took 1 dose of her own pepsid in her car while she was waiting her 30 minute period.  Vitals:  SPO2 98%,  pulse 55 bpm steady,  strong. She was offered EMS,  and she declined.  Medical staff recommended calling her pcp ASAP and scheduling a virtual urgent care visit to mitigate her COVID concerns in hospital settings.  Patient then said that she felt ready to go home,  and she was advised to lay with her feet up, sip water,  eat crackers,  and use ice or head to alleviate pain and reduce anxiety.

Co-suspect products included maraviroc unknown (batch number UNK, expiry date unknown) for hiv infection, dolutegravir unknown (batch number UNK, expiry date unknown) for hiv infection, darunavir unknown (batch number UNK, expiry date unknown) for hiv infection and ritonavir unknown (batch number UNK, expiry date unknown) for hiv infection.   The patient's past medical history included smoker. Concurrent medical conditions included acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-1 approximately 25 years prior, his CD4 count was 12 cells/mm3).   On an unknown date, the patient received Hepatitis B vaccine, maraviroc at an unknown dose and frequency, dolutegravir at an unknown dose and frequency, darunavir at an unknown dose and frequency and ritonavir at an unknown dose and frequency. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Hepatitis B vaccine and not applicable after starting maraviroc and dolutegravir, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), hepatitis b (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), cytomegalovirus infection (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), aspergillus fumigatus infection (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), cough (serious criteria hospitalization), wheezing (serious criteria hospitalization), shortness of breath (serious criteria hospitalization), chills (serious criteria hospitalization), bronchitis (serious criteria hospitalization), influenza a virus infection (serious criteria hospitalization), fever (serious criteria hospitalization), productive cough (serious criteria hospitalization), brain abscess (serious criteria GSK medically significant), brain lesion and nausea. The patient was treated with levofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), prednisone, piperacillin + tazobactam (Piperacillin-Tazobactam), vancomycin, voriconazole, micafungin and emtricitabine + tenofovir. The action taken with maraviroc was unknown. The action taken with dolutegravir was unknown. The action taken with darunavir was unknown. The action taken with ritonavir was unknown. On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, hepatitis b, cytomegalovirus infection, aspergillus fumigatus infection, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, chills, bronchitis, influenza a virus infection, fever, productive cough, brain abscess, brain lesion and nausea were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, hepatitis b, cytomegalovirus infection, aspergillus fumigatus infection, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, chills, bronchitis, influenza a virus infection, fever, productive cough, brain abscess and brain lesion to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine. The reporter considered the nausea to be related to maraviroc and dolutegravir.  Additional details were provided as follows: This was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure, in a male patient aged 54-year-old, who was vaccinated with unspecified Hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a man with a history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At the time of initial diagnosis of HIV-1 approximately 25 years prior, his CD4 count was 12 cells/mm3. The patient had poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The patient reported stopping his ART (maraviroc, dolutegravir, darunavir, and ritonavir) for approximately 4 months prior to presentation due to nausea, but he had restarted again two months prior to admission. Social history was significant for smoking. The patient worked as a nurse in a prison facility for several years. The patient was in a monogamous relationship with 1 male partner. The patient had 4 dogs and 1 pet cat. No information on patient family history was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received unspecified hepatitis B vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported. Since 2009, the patient had positive surface antibody titers noted.  On an unknown date, an unknown time after vaccination, the patient experienced cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and intermittent chills. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department and was given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for possible bronchitis. The patient symptoms did not improve, and presented again after 1 week at which time he was tested positive for influenza A. When symptoms still persisted, the patient was then started on prednisone and levofloxacin 1 week later. The patient had some relief from his symptoms but soon after his fevers recurred with productive cough and shortness of breath. The patient was therefore admitted and noted to have a fever of 102F. Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin were started in addition to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for broad empiric treatment. The patient left against medical advice on day 3, only to be readmitted to the hospital after cell free DNA (cfDNA) testing of plasma returned positive for Aspergillus fumigatus, HBV, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) within 72 hours of specimen collection. On an unknown date, the patient presented with progressive cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and intermittent chills for 1 month. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was done which showed a left lower lobe 4 centimeter necrotic cavitary mass-like consolidation with thickened irregular walls, shaggy inner linings and septations, ground glass halo, as well as pericavitary irregular nodules and consolidations. The appearance of the cavity was consistent with angioinvasive aspergillosis. cfDNA next generation sequencing (NGS) was sent and revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus, HBV, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Aspergillus fumigatus was detected at 242 DNA molecules per microliter (MPM; reference level less than 10) and CMV level was 378 MPM. DNA sequencing detected HBV, but MPM was not reported as there is no environmental control for this virus. A sputum fungal culture eventually returned positive for heavy Aspergillus fumigatus after approximately 2 weeks, with a voriconazole MIC of 0.5 ug/mL. Levels of Serum Tests at presentation Aspergillus Galactomannan was 0.660 (ref range less than 0.5), Beta-d Glucan was more than 500 pg/mL ref range less than 80 pg/ml). Histoplasma urine antigen testing was negative. Serum CMV PCR testing showed a low-level viremia of 256 IU/ml. Repeat HBV testing demonstrated positive surface antigen, loss of surface antibody, positive core antibody, and positive E antigen. Hep B DNA was more than 1000,000,000 IU/mL, which along with elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 55 U/L; alanine amino transferase (ALT) was 73 U/L) suggested active infection. The patient was admitted and during this admission, the patient was noted to have a CD4 count of 76 cells/mm3 with undetectable HIV viral load. Four months prior, the patient CD4 count was 379 cells/mm3. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was done due to concern for central nervous system involvement. It showed 8, scattered, small nodular rim-enhancing lesions in bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemisphere. Lumbar puncture was performed that showed total nucleated cell count of 2 with 88% neutrophils on differential. Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) glucose was 42 mg/dl, protein level was 28.9 mg/dl, and no growth of fungus was noted from CSF culture. Toxoplasma IgG and IgM were negative. Given the overall clinical picture, these brain lesions were consistent with brain abscesses due to disseminated aspergillosis from the lungs. CMV infection was assessed to be a result of reactivation in the setting of immunodeficiency, and not likely a contributing cause of lung or brain infection. A repeat chest x-ray 2 weeks after discharge showed improvement in bilateral consolidations. Repeat serum aspergillus antigen level in 1 month was undetectable. During follow up, 4 months later, Levels of Serum Tests showed Aspergillus Galactomannan was less than 0.50, Beta-d Glucan was 63 pg/mL, Hep B DNA was 541000 IU/mL and alanine amino transferase (ALT) was 49 U/L. HBV DNA PCR repeated after 4 months was 5.75 log IU/ml, and the CD4 count improved to 265 cells/mm3. CT scan of the chest was done 6 months after starting treatment and showed regression of the irregular cavitary consolidation within the superior segment of the left lung. The case was considered as suspected vaccination failure being time to onset and dosing schedule unknown. The case was considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment included: Given the result of cfDNA NGS, along with imaging and history suggestive of invasive aspergillosis of the lungs and brain,  the patient's treatment was changed to voriconazole given as a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours intravenously (IV) and then continued at 4 mg/kg every 12 hours after the initial 2 loading doses. Micafungin was added for synergy with voriconazole. He was switched to oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily after 2 weeks of IV treatment with plans to continue treatment for at least 12 months. The patient was also started on emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment for HBV infection. Antiretroviral therapy was resumed with maraviroc, dolutegravir, darunavir, and ritonavir.  The authors commented ""NGS of cfDNA has another advantage of detecting co-infections. Our patient, who reported prior immunization to HBV with documented protective titers, tested positive for this virus as an incidental finding. Subsequently, HBV DNA detected in the blood by PCR and elevated liver transaminases confirmed active infection. The patient's HBV infection could be explained by the loss of immune response from initial vaccination with subsequent exposure in the setting of lowered CD4 count off of ART. This case highlights that the HBV co-infection could have been missed if the focus was on obtaining bronchoscopy-guided tissue sampling due to high suspicion of invasive aspergillosis on presentation. There is, therefore, potential utility of using NGS of cfDNA to rapidly diagnose multiple co-infections in severely immunocompromised patients without the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. In this case, the patient benefited from early Hepatitis B treatment because of this test. Frequently, this test can detect DNA viruses, such as CMV and herpes simplex virus 1, which could be present in the blood of immunocompromised hosts without clinical manifestations indicative of active disease to warrant directed treatment. Our case reflected that as well; the patient improved with ART and did not need directed CMV treatment. It is also possible that infections in certain organ systems may result in lower levels of pathogen cfDNA, reducing the sensitivity of the test. Thus, the clinical utility of plasma cfDNA testing should be assessed for usefulness on a case-by-case basis and needs to be interpreted cautiously within the clinical context"". The authors concluded ""Plasma NGS testing of cfDNA has been helpful in diagnosing invasive fungal infections, including Rhizopus, Scedosporium, and Aspergillus.6 In order to maximize sensitivity, it is best if this test is sent early and prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy. The advantage of the test is that it is non-invasive and can potentially help with pathogen identification with results available within 72 hours. This may provide significant diagnostic value even if sent after initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Another advantage is its capacity to detect co-infections, which is important in immunocompromised patients who can present with multiple opportunistic infections as well as reactivation of prior infections, as seen in our patient. Several limitations of NGS should be kept in mind.

Cases were included if they met clinical criteria for stiff person syndrome (SPS) based on an adapted Dalakas Criteria and if SPS symptom onset occurred before age 18 years]. The patient was woman. The patient had personal history of autoimmunity as autoimmune thyroiditis, Diabetes mellitus type 1. The patient had no family History of autoimmunity. No information on patient's concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, 3 months before symptom onset, the patient received unspecified Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, between March 2001 and February 2019, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient had initial presentation to center as horizontal double vision; upper back tightness and spasms; left shoulder/arm stiffness. Time to diagnosis from Symptom Onset was 6.5 years. Exam findings at initial presentation to center was dysarthria; right internuclear ophthalmoplegia; impaired saccades on right gaze; downbeat nystagmus; torso rigidity; spasticity in the hands and arms; bradykinesia; hyperreflexia; dysmetria in left more than right hands; impaired fine finger movements and foot tapping. At the age of 21.3 years, the patient was diagnosed to Stiff Person Syndrome Phenotype as Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus. Serum Anti-glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibody titers was 89856 IU/ml (normal less than or equal to 1 IU/ml). Serum anti-amphiphysin antibodies was negative. Serum Anti-Glycine receptor (GlyR) Antibodies was not performed. CSF white blood cell count was unknown (normal 6-7/uL). CSF Protein was unknown (normal 15-60 mg/dL).

Immunotherapy received or currently receiving was intravenous immunoglobulin. Relevant symptomatic treatments received or currently receiving was Baclofen, benzodiazepines. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at Most Recent Visit was 4. Timed 25 foot walk test at most recent visit was wheel-chair bound. [Within the study period, 186 patients with SPS were seen. Fifteen patients (8%) had symptom onset in childhood, of whom 11 (73%) were female and 13 (87%) were a specific ethnicity. The median age of symptom onset was 14.8 years (range 8.4 to 16.9 years), and the median latency from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6.2 years (range 0.4 to 15.0 years). Nine individuals (60%) were not diagnosed until adulthood, despite symptom onset occurring during childhood. Twelve individuals met criteria for classic SPS and three for progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). Individuals had a median total of four of the 12 symptoms and examination findings assessed (range 2 to 8), and 13 individuals (87%) had three or more reported features. Of the 15 individuals who met inclusion criteria, 11 (73%) were female and 13 (87%) were a specific ethnicity. Median age at symptom onset was 14.8 years (range 8.4 to 16.9), and median latency from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6.2 years (range 0.4 to 15.0). Nine individuals (60%) were not diagnosed until adulthood. The most common presenting features were painful spasms (n = 12, 80%), hyper-reflexia (n = 11, 73%), axial rigidity (n = 9, 60%), lower extremity rigidity or spasticity (n = 8, 53%), gait abnormalities (n = 6, 40%), and hyperlordosis (n = 6, 40%). Other noted features included anxiety (n = 5, 33%), dysautonomia (n = 3, 20%), and cranial neuropathies (n = 3, 20%; e.g., ptosis, double vision, nystagmus, and eye movement abnormalities). Personal (n = 9, 60%) and family history (n = 9, 60%) of autoimmune conditions was common. Serum antiglutamate decarboxylase 65 antibodies were found in 13 individuals (87%). Nearly all individuals received immunotherapy (n = 14, 93%), symptomatic medications (n = 15, 100%), and non-pharmacologic therapies (n = 14, 93%). However, most had persistent physical limitations, particularly impaired walking (n = 7, 47%) and inability to carry out previous activities (n = 14, 93%). Eight individuals (53%) reported having possible triggering events within one to three months of symptom onset. These events included a preceding infection (Ehrlichia along with Lyme disease-related Bell's Palsy and mononucleosis in one individual each), vaccination against human papillomavirus (in two individuals), concussion (in one individual), head trauma related to a motor vehicle accident (in one individual), and stressful life event (parents' divorce and familial financial stress in one individual each). Personal history (n = 9, 60%) and first-degree relative family history (n = 9, 60%) of autoimmune disease were commonly seen. Thirteen individuals (87%) had positive serum anti-GAD65 antibody titers (median 3183 IU/mL, range 1.2 to 184,320 IU/mL; normal less than or equal to 1 IU/mL) at the time of first evaluation in center, three of whom were on immunotherapy for concurrent autoimmune disease at that time. No individual had detected anti-amphiphysin antibodies, one individual had anti-GlyR antibodies, and one individual had both anti-GAD65 and anti-GlyR antibodies. Seven individuals (64%) underwent lumbar punctures; three individuals (43%) had pleocytosis (6 to 17/mL), one individual (14%) demonstrated oligoclonal bands unique to the cerebrospinal fluid, and all three individuals who had cerebrospinal fluid anti-GAD65 antibody testing were positive (more than 0.02 nmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal band testing was either unknown or not performed (n = 2) or not present (n = 1) in the three individuals with detected CSF anti-GAD65 antibodies. All individuals had electromyography, and five individuals (36%) had abnormal results: continuous muscle fiber activity at rest, or cocontraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, or combination of these findings. Nearly all individuals received immunotherapy (n = 14, 93%), symptomatic medications (n = 15, 100%), and a variety of non-pharmacologic therapies (n = 14, 93%), reporting most favorable responses to a combination of interventions. At the most recent clinic visit mRS score, which assigns scores to motor disability from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (dead), was assessed (median 12.2 years from symptom onset, range 1.03 to 27.6 years). Individual scores ranged from 1 to 4 with a median score of 3. An increased number of symptoms and neurological examination abnormalities was seen in individuals with higher mRS scores. None of the individuals with more than four symptoms and signs had an mRS score of less than 3. Three individuals (20%) were wheelchair-dependent, and two (13%) required walker or unilateral cane. T25FW test results were available for nine individuals]. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author commented, ""In this study, we demonstrated a wide spectrum of both typical and less commonly seen features in individuals with pediatric onset SPS. Delay in diagnosis, whether secondary to unrecognized symptoms or limited knowledge of the disease by clinicians, appears to be common, as diagnosis is often delayed until adulthood, at which point disability accrual is frequently seen. Although SPS is a rare neurological disease, recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to addressing patients' symptoms and may enable improved outcomes and quality of life. Therefore such delays in diagnosis may be even more problematic in children with SPS, where functional impairment during a time of ongoing neurological and social development may have a profound impact on long term well-being and functionality. In our cohort, nearly two of three individuals did not receive a diagnosis of SPS until adulthood despite symptom onset in childhood, and median latency from symptom onset to diagnosis was more than six years. Although most children with SPS present with a similar clinical phenotype to adults with SPS, other clinical features were identified in our series. The most common presenting symptoms and examination findings were painful spasms, hyperreflexia, axial rigidity, and lower extremity rigidity and spasticity. Other features seen include gait abnormalities, hyperlordosis, dysautonomia, anxiety, and cranial neuropathies. The presence of such symptoms should therefore not discount consideration of SPS in children, especially because the full spectrum of associated signs and symptoms continues to expand. Personal and family history of autoimmune diseases was common; hence, it is important for clinicians to be aware of common comorbid autoimmune conditions and monitor their development over time. Diagnostic evaluation can aid in making the diagnosis of SPS in children, as most individuals in our series had positive anti-GAD65 antibody titers in the setting of a classic clinical phenotype. Individuals received a combination of immunotherapy as well as symptomatic pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy. Nearly all described physical limitations and were unable to carry out previous activities. In our cohort, compared with individuals with the classic phenotype, those with PERM phenotypically have different presentations because of brainstem involvement, cortical involvement, and likely overall more body regions involved. Clinical presentation along with particular examination findings may help distinguish these phenotypes. In addition, the time to diagnosis appears shorter and the mRS score slightly greater in individuals with PERM phenotype compared with those with classic phenotype. The main limitations of this study and others dealing with rare conditions are (1) small sample size, (2) lack of prognostic biomarkers of disease severity or progression, and (3) treatment approaches that are not uniform and often involve a multimodal approach, leading to difficulty in understanding effects of individual treatments. Future collaborative studies will help to minimize these limitations and further our understanding of pathophysiology, optimal evaluation and management, and outcomes in this potentially debilitating disease."" The author concluded, ""This study describes our center's experience with pediatric onset SPS with the goal of increasing provider awareness of this debilitating but treatable disease.

The patient was a part of the study that aimed was to characterize the spectrum of clinical features and examination findings in pediatric-onset stiff person syndrome. [In this study, medical records were reviewed for all patients treated for stiff person syndrome with symptom onset in childhood at a tertiary medical center between March 2001 and February 2019. Cases were included if they met clinical criteria for stiff person syndrome (SPS) based on an adapted Dalakas Criteria and if SPS symptom onset occurred before age 18 years]. The patient was woman. The patient had personal history of autoimmunity as autoimmune thyroiditis. The patient had no family History of autoimmunity. No information on patient's concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, 1 month before symptom onset, the patient received unspecified Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, between March 2001 and February 2019, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient had initial presentation to center as upper back spasms; right hand pain. Time to diagnosis from symptom onset was 2.5 years. Exam findings at initial presentation to center was dysarthria; right hand/arm spasticity; thoracic and lumbar paravertebral muscle spasms; feet spasms. At the age of 19.4 years, the patient was diagnosed to Stiff Person Syndrome Phenotype as classic. Serum Anti-glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibody titers was 3183 IU/ml (normal less than or equal to 1 IU/ml). Serum anti-amphiphysin antibodies was negative. Serum Anti-Glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies was negative. CSF white blood cell count was 1/uL (normal 6-7/uL). CSF Protein was 47 mg/dl (normal 15-60 mg/dL).

Electromyography (EMG) was continuous muscle fiber activity and co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles). Immunotherapy received or currently receiving was intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, rituximab. Relevant symptomatic treatments received or currently receiving was benzodiazepines, baclofen, dantrolene, tizanidine, methocarbamol, levetiracetam, and botulinum toxin. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at Most Recent Visit was 4. Timed 25 foot walk test at most recent visit was wheel-chair bound. [Within the study period, 186 patients with SPS were seen. Fifteen patients (8%) had symptom onset in childhood, of whom 11 (73%) were female and 13 (87%). The median age of symptom onset was 14.8 years (range 8.4 to 16.9 years), and the median latency from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6.2 years (range 0.4 to 15.0 years). Nine individuals (60%) were not diagnosed until adulthood, despite symptom onset occurring during childhood. Twelve individuals met criteria for classic SPS and three for progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). Individuals had a median total of four of the 12 symptoms and examination findings assessed (range 2 to 8), and 13 individuals (87%) had three or more reported features. Of the 15 individuals who met inclusion criteria, 11 (73%) were female and 13 (87%). Median age at symptom onset was 14.8 years (range 8.4 to 16.9), and median latency from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6.2 years (range 0.4 to 15.0). Nine individuals (60%) were not diagnosed until adulthood. The most common presenting features were painful spasms (n = 12, 80%), hyper-reflexia (n = 11, 73%), axial rigidity (n = 9, 60%), lower extremity rigidity or spasticity (n = 8, 53%), gait abnormalities (n = 6, 40%), and hyperlordosis (n = 6, 40%). Other noted features included anxiety (n = 5, 33%), dysautonomia (n = 3, 20%), and cranial neuropathies (n = 3, 20%; e.g., ptosis, double vision, nystagmus, and eye movement abnormalities). Personal (n = 9, 60%) and family history (n = 9, 60%) of autoimmune conditions was common. Serum antiglutamate decarboxylase 65 antibodies were found in 13 individuals (87%). Nearly all individuals received immunotherapy (n = 14, 93%), symptomatic medications (n = 15, 100%), and non-pharmacologic therapies (n = 14, 93%). However, most had persistent physical limitations, particularly impaired walking (n = 7, 47%) and inability to carry out previous activities (n = 14, 93%). Eight individuals (53%) reported having possible triggering events within one to three months of symptom onset. These events included a preceding infection (Ehrlichia along with Lyme disease-related Bell's Palsy and mononucleosis in one individual each), vaccination against human papillomavirus (in two individuals), concussion (in one individual), head trauma related to a motor vehicle accident (in one individual), and stressful life event (parents' divorce and familial financial stress in one individual each). Personal history (n = 9, 60%) and first-degree relative family history (n = 9, 60%) of autoimmune disease were commonly seen. Thirteen individuals (87%) had positive serum anti-GAD65 antibody titers (median 3183 IU/mL, range 1.2 to 184,320 IU/mL; normal less than or equal to 1 IU/mL) at the time of first evaluation in center, three of whom were on immunotherapy for concurrent autoimmune disease at that time. No individual had detected anti-amphiphysin antibodies, one individual had anti-GlyR antibodies, and one individual had both anti-GAD65 and anti-GlyR antibodies. Seven individuals (64%) underwent lumbar punctures; three individuals (43%) had pleocytosis (6 to 17/mL), one individual (14%) demonstrated oligoclonal bands unique to the cerebrospinal fluid, and all three individuals who had cerebrospinal fluid anti-GAD65 antibody testing were positive (more than 0.02 nmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal band testing was either unknown or not performed (n = 2) or not present (n = 1) in the three individuals with detected CSF anti-GAD65 antibodies. All individuals had electromyography, and five individuals (36%) had abnormal results: continuous muscle fiber activity at rest, or cocontraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, or combination of these findings. Nearly all individuals received immunotherapy (n = 14, 93%), symptomatic medications (n = 15, 100%), and a variety of non-pharmacologic therapies (n = 14, 93%), reporting most favorable responses to a combination of interventions. At the most recent clinic visit mRS score, which assigns scores to motor disability from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (dead), was assessed (median 12.2 years from symptom onset, range 1.03 to 27.6 years). Individual scores ranged from 1 to 4 with a median score of 3. An increased number of symptoms and neurological examination abnormalities was seen in individuals with higher mRS scores. None of the individuals with more than four symptoms and signs had an mRS score of less than 3. Three individuals (20%) were wheelchair-dependent, and two (13%) required walker or unilateral cane.

On an unspecified date, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient presented with subjective myalgias lasting 2 days. Vital signs were stable. Complete Blood Count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) were unremarkable. Serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl. The patient was discharged on supportive therapy. The patient presented a day later with persistent flu-like symptoms. Labs revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl, normal renal function, total protein, albumin, ACE levels; clear UA with no albuminuria; low PTH and 1, 25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated PTHrP & viscosity levels. 24-hour urine collection revealed proteinuria (550 mg). Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy. Quantitative immunoglobulins revealed elevated IgA (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG and IgM levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1. Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP), Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP), and serum immunofixation revealed IgA-Kappa multiple myeloma (MM). Given her severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia, the patient was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, pamidronate, and hemodialysis. The patient's calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl. Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions. The patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid; and the patient had not attained remission from myeloma yet. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization. The author commented, ""Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. Several cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-beta, derived from myeloma cells are thought to accelerate osteoclastic bone resorption and cause hypercalcemia through a paracrine mechanism. Our case is unique in that the patient initially had a normal serum calcium level that had increased rapidly to over 22 mg/dl within a period of 24 hours, had no renal failure or any bone involvement; and had a normal quantitative serum light chain measurement. It is theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM. This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated, that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM.""
