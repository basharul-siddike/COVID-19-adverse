This was significant, as I am on the Nexplanon birth control implant, and have been for 4 years. During those 4 years, I have had essentially no periods, with some very irregular light spotting (roughly 1-3 days a year). Since June 2021, however, I started spotting for multiple days, and experiencing bleeding that seemed to be menses. The timing, however, was irregular. For example, I would bleed for 6 days with a normal menses flow, and then 9 days later, I experiences 4 days of light bleeding/spotting. Then 8 days later, I experienced two days of spotting. Then I experienced nothing for 3 weeks, after which I experienced 15 days of spotting/bleeding. I sought out medical attention in early July.",,,,,,,,,U,03/23/2021,06/15/2021,84,"I went to my OBGYN in early July, after experiencing bleeding for the first time in 4 years despite still being on the Nexplanon implant. She advised me to see if the irregular bleeding continued over the next 1-2 months. She also ordered a transvaginal ultrasound if I experience continued irregularity to rule out anything serious.  After experiencing irregular menses in July and August, I scheduled a transvaginal ultrasound mid-August. The ultrasound didn't reveal anything serious. I had a follow up with my OBGYN on 1 September, during which she prescribed a course of Ibuprofen to see if anti-inflammatory medication would help.  I did a course of the Ibruprofen and still experience bleeding and some irregularity. I was advised that I could request additional birth control pills to try to reset my menses. I have not yet explored this option.  My menses are not painful, though I do experience PMS, i.e. swelling of breasts, tenderness, acne breakouts, and fatigue.

1794149,10/17/2021,MA,26.0,26,,F,,"Patient received the seasonal flu vaccination from her school on January 5, 2021 at the facility. Approximately 2.5 weeks later consistent headache was noted by patient as she resumed her day to day activities and career as a preschool teacher. On January 25, patient reported a tingling sensation in her face followed by repetitive nose flaring and scrunching. Symptoms proceeded to raising of the upper lip bilaterally, right greater than left. Symptoms then progressed to seizure/tic like symptoms, convulsing and shaking of her entire body bilaterally without loss of consciousness. She was then sent to ER on 1/25/21  where evaluation work up was completed.  After initial episode of attacks, patient began to have episodes of nasal flaring, scrunching and locking of the mouth almost every day for one month. January 2021-February 2021. The nasal flaring and jaw symptoms lessened to weekly and then resolved in April/May 2021.   In July of 2021 these episodes/attacks began again consistently with stereotyped involuntary motor movements of whole body, spasticity in limbs, and tingling in nose/face lasting for a minimum of 20 minutes up to an hour. These attacks have caused extreme levels of anxiety, depression, stress and pain unable to complete her day to day tasks and career as she was able to prior. While patient is awake and alert throughout attacks, at times, she is unable to speak due to spasms in mouth causing locking of jaw. When symptoms heightened again in July, an ambulance was called and she was taken to the ER where she was given ativan and discharged home.  In September of 2021, patient was seen by neurologist, who diagnosed her with functional movement disorder. As stated in his detailed assessment,  patient's symptoms may be exacerbated by anxiety and stress triggers yet the actual cause of these attacks and episodes still remains completely unknown. As time progresses, these attacks cause brain and structural changes impacting wellness and optimal functioning.    Fast forward to present day, again it's OCTOBER- almost a year since the initial onset of symptoms requiring hospitalization. Patient has still been experiencing all of these symptoms as explained in depth above including but not limited to:  involuntary stereotyped joint/muscular tics and contractions, spasticity in hands, and stroke like symptoms with facial drooping and tingling of nose.    Prior to receiving the flu shot in January patient was a healthy, happy, functioning 27 year old independent female working, married,  and pursuing a degree in social work while teaching at a pre-school full time. These attacks are not patient's baseline and are are extremely debilitating to her physical, mental AND emotional well being. With the frequency and onset of these attacks almost daily every aspect of her life is impacted. At times she is unable to fulfill her role as a student and as an employee to the severity and intensity of these attacks. Patient was prescribed a muscle relaxant to alleviate pain levels for joint pain with the attacks yet these have an intensive sedating effect and are unrealistic for an individual to take regularly in order to function in society with a career and schooling.   Per neurology report, and testing completed thus far, the definitive cause of these attacks all are consistent with the administration of the influenza vaccination in January of 2021. With patient having no significant past medical history prior to the vaccination there is a high probability the vaccination triggered these attacks.   Patient referred to this writer (me) following initial OT evaluation at facility in September of 2021 for cognitive behavioral therapy treatment. Patient will continue for next 2 months to manage anxiety symptoms and stress levels from these episodes as they are severely impacting all aspects of her every day life and career currently as listed in depth above.

I felt completely normal after a week.  Covid Vaccine Dose #2: Pfizer ? August 18 ? Minor fatigue turned into intense body fatigue and body aches for the first 2.5 weeks.  Symptoms included headache and nausea.  I felt absolutely awful  On Day 18, I started a course of Prednisone ? 20 mg for 5 days.  My strength began to come back but my brain fog was still very intense.  My physical strength held up after the steroids but my energy would crash around 4 pm.  One month after the vaccine, I re-started Thymasin Alpha 1 daily and then added BPC 157 to 4 pills per day.  This was the regimen that I used in early 2020 that coincided with improvement. I also started Ketotifen, an antihistamine to combat possible Mast Cell issues.  Three days later on September 21, I woke up nauseous in the middle of the night and began several weeks of intense anxiety that I had not experience since early 2020.  I also began to experience very bad tinnitus in my ears. Toward the end of September 2021, the weakness in my body began to increase.  I stopped the Thymasin Alpha 1 and Ketotifen to see if there was a correlation. I cut the BPC 157 to twice per day.  October 5: My legs and arms felt so weak that they felt numb.

Saturday Evening, Oct. 9, extreme reaction to what I believe to be the Pfizer booster. Symptoms appeared severely and suddenly. From my neck to my waist, front, sides, and back of my torso, what felt like piercing, debilitating muscle spasms with any extremely small movement. With movement, even breathing the wrong way, must have lasted only seconds but felt like minutes of torture. I do not remember my legs or arms having, for lack of a better word, spasms, but I could not put my leg on a small step stool without my husband?s help. Perhaps because the leg movement could not be achieved without some mid-body movement.

Then shortly after within the same week of the vaccine I noticed subtle things like difficulty bringing my arm up to brush my teeth.  I could do it but it was like I was fighting my body to do so.  Symptoms increasingly got worse and more symptoms were noticed and they are as follows: Difficulty typing, difficulty writing, dizziness, difficulty walking - gait off and difficulty getting to a standing position, extreme weakness in my legs (had to stop driving), difficulty holding items and felt like I was going to drop things as I was very weak in my arms, chest pain, emotional extreme fatigue, I had a short bout of time of nauseau, uncomfortable/painful feeling in my chest...felt like things were swelling, my voice kept changing, waves of feeling like I was powering down, when I laid down...I would feel like I was going to pass out so I would sleep sitting up in a recliner, felt like I was in a fog, emotional and would cry over nothing (so not like me at all...typically a happy person), felt like my body was fighting me all the time.  This started as subtle signs and increasingly got worse with more and more signs and symptoms coming on for two months.  On July 7th, I took a nap in the afternoon and when I woke up I noticed a significant difference.  The dizziness was gone.  I continued over the next couple of weeks to slowly improve.  My doctor's were contributing this to low thyroid levels.  However, when I had the same reaction after the second Moderna vaccine I am thinking that perhaps it is a result of the vaccine.  I will submit a second document for my symptoms after the second vaccine.  I feel like my body over reacts after the vaccine and it exasperates signs and symptoms of my current medical issues (low thyroid symptoms and inflammatory condition as a result of having Covid in January of 2021) and in addition new symptoms show up such as the neurological issues as well.

On Monday 9/27, I noticed subtle neurological symptoms start just like after the first vaccine with difficulty putting my arm to my mouth when brushing my teeth.  It increasingly got worse on 9/28 and I was having difficulty writing, my gait was off, dizziness and light headed, my chest began to hurt (inflammatory condition symptoms), fatigue continued., feeling like I was powering down, when I laid down dizziness was worse and felt like I was going to pass out...had to sleep sitting up, extreme weakness in my arms and legs, difficulty getting from a sitting position to a standing position and when I do I have to try to get my balance before taking steps or I am afraid I am going to fall.  I thought about going to the ER  mainly because of the chest pain but I decided to take the ibuprofen to see if that would help with the chest pain and it did.  I did not have all of the same symptoms as last time, I had less symptoms this time and they were short lived.  I had the symptoms for a week and a half and then it all subsided leaving me with my normal low thyroid symptoms of weak legs and fatigue.  However, the inflammatory symptoms have continued to linger with coming and going in waves to this day.  The neurological symptoms subsided in a week and I slowly started to improve after that and after a week and a half, it seemed to be over.  It seems just like after the first vaccine, my symptoms of low thyroid and inflammatory condition are exasperated due to the vaccine and in addition neurological symptoms also start to occur after the vaccine.  I did not report this with the first vaccine because I did not contribute these symptoms to the vaccine at first.  I had no idea why this was happening to me.  Then, when I discussed it with both my primary doctor and my endocrinologist and the ER doctor...they all thought it was a result of low thyroid symptoms.  I missed my second dose due to being in the hospital and was hesitant to get my second dose but after talking to my endocrinologist again about my symptoms and whether she thought it was a result of low thyroid levels, she said yes.  I decided then I would get my second dose and then experienced the same symptoms after the second dose only not as severe and not as long of period of time.

It at triage patient was noted to be saturating 86% on room air.  She was placed on 2 L nasal cannula and improved to 93%.  Of note patient is not on home oxygen.  Her physical exam is remarkable for a fatigued appearing elderly woman, with crackles across the lung fields bilaterally.  Differential diagnosis includes but is not limited to viral versus bacterial pneumonia, pancreatitis, biliary pathology.  IV access was established she was given 1 L of IV fluids for hydration given reports of poor oral intake, as well as Zofran for nausea. EKG is obtained which does not demonstrate peaked T-waves, evidence of ischemia, or right axis deviation.  No significant changes when compared to EKG from 08/04/2021. Patient has a workup which is significant for positive COVID-19 PCR. Patient is a CT thorax which shows findings consistent with a viral pneumonia, no evidence of underlying bacterial process.  Given patient's hypoxia on room air as well as her tachypnea, she will be admitted to the hospitalist service for continued management.  Patient did not have clinical deterioration while in the emergency department. 10/13/2021 note: ASSESSMENT / PLAN:  Patient is an 83 year old female with CAD status post stenting in 2005, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and CKD who presented with approximately one month of fatigue and malaise as well as progressive shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. She was found to be COVID-19 positive, despite being fully vaccinated. #COVID-19 pneumonia CT thorax showed peripheral areas of ground glass opacities, consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Procalcitonin 0.37, have low suspicion for superimposed bacterial pneumonia, especially given no focal consolidation on imaging. Exact date of symptom onset difficult to ascertain; therefore, is outside the window for remdesivir. National shortage of tocilizumab currently.  Plan:  - Continue dexamethasone 6mg daily x10 days total or until discharge. - Tessalon perles for cough. - Supplemental oxygen therapy as needed 10/15/2021 note: ASSESSMENT / PLAN:  Patient is an 83 year old female with CAD status post stent placement in 2005, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and CKD who presented with 3-4 weeks of fatigue and malaise as well as progressive shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. She was found to be COVID-19 positive. Her oxygen requirements have been relatively stable; however, she has been intermittently disoriented and agitated, requiring PRN Zyprexa.  #COVID-19 pneumonia Patient's oxygen requirements have been stable to improving. She was on 70% FiO2/50 L/min on high flow nasal cannula at the time of my exam.  Plan: - Continue dexamethasone 6mg daily x10 days total or until discharge. - Supplemental oxygen therapy as needed. - Tessalon perles for cough.  #Hypoxia Most likely secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia, which appeared worse on CTA 10/13 compared to imaging on 10/11. Low suspicion for PE, given no evidence of PE on CTA. Management as above. 10/17/2021 note: Assessment/Plan  Patient is an 83 year old female with CAD status post stent placement in 2005, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and CKD who presented with 3-4 weeks of fatigue and malaise as well as progressive shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. She was found to be COVID-19 positive, admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to COVID pneumonia. # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure #COVID-19 pneumonia # Borderline hypothermia, concern for bacterial pneumonia  Patient has required up to 100% FiO2 over the last 24 hours to maintain her oxygen saturations. CTA performed yesterday, 10/16, for episode of hypoxia out of concern for PE, which was negative for PE but demonstrated worsening pneumonia and left lower lobe airspace disease. Was started on empiric therapy for possible hospital acquired pneumonia yesterday, 10/16. Blood cultures collected 10/16 show NGTD. MRSA nares pending. If negative, can likely discontinue vancomycin.

The fever persisted all day even with Tylenol so I located a rapid test and did it for her, so she went to the hospital and it was positive, this is all a back story and probably how I ended up getting Covid. On Thursday Sept 2 I had to go to the OB on call at the hospital because I was having a lot of Bronchitis symptoms. They treated me with antibiotics, so I went on that. While still on the antibiotics, on the 8th of September I woke up with congestion, body aches, no fever, muscles and bones hurting and I had a cough I think, a mild one. I had a lot of post nasal drip drainage going on at that time. Then, the symptoms persisted and then when I woke up on Sept. 10th 2021 and I could not smell or taste anymore. Then over the weekend I was still not feeling well and having trouble breathing so I took my albuterol inhaler. On Monday, the 13th I got the antibody treatment. On Sept 14th I felt a little better and by Friday the 17th I felt a bit better. I was finally cleared for end of isolation on Sept. 19th 2021, I was definitely better but no taste and smell still and a lot of drainage. Maybe by the 24th of Sept I was feeling a lot better but still no taste and smell, the smell came back on Oct 1st, but very minimal and fluctuated. By now, 10/18/2021 it is better but the lack of taste and smell is still there, it is subdued and goes in and out throughout the day.

September 24, 2021 due to the mandate to keep my job as a substitute teacher.  I started feeling bad and my breathing deteriorated each day to the point where I was out of breath.  On Wednesday, September 29, 2021, I went to urgent care.   After initial check-up, they called the ambulance and I was transported to the Emergency Room and immediately placed on high flow oxygen.  One more day delay and I would have died due to lack of oxygen. At the hospital, on Thursday, September 30, 2021, the doctor removed ONE Liter (Quart) of fluid from my right lung, the next day the doctor removed ONE and ONE THIRD liters of fluid from my left lung.  The fluid was a rusty reddish color.   At the hospital, all kinds to tests were performed, heart test, cancer test, COVID19 test and bacterial tests, all results were negative.  By Saturday, I was off oxygen and was released from the hospital on Monday, October 4, 2021.  By the end of the week, I again started feeling out of breath.  On Monday, October 11, the doctor ordered a chest X-ray.  The x-ray was read on Tuesday morning.  The Doctor immediately called me and told me to go to Emergency Room at Medical Center.  On Wednesday, October 13, 2021, surgery was performed on me to install draining tubes from both of my lungs.  More than a liter of fluid was removed from each of my lungs.  Again, more tests were performed on me to find the root cause and none were found.  On Friday, October 15, I was released from the hospital with tubes from my lungs.    On Sunday, October 17, 2021, the visiting nurse came to my house and drained 25 ml from my right lung and 75 ml from my left lung. The nurse is scheduled to come three times a week to remove the fluid.

Last dose of the Benadryl and some Motrin were given around 6:30 p.m. Saturday night (10/9).  She woke up at 6:00 a.m. and I checked her - this is where she had large hives all over her entire body and her face was swollen on her right side with eyes also being swollen.  I gave her a dose of Benadryl, about 10 minutes later gave her Motrin to help with swelling and then gave her the Zyrtec she normally gets.  Her breathing was ok so I waited for urgent care to open and took her there to hopefully get a steriod.  Dr. prescribed the 5 days of Prednisolone (5ML) (Location Urgent Care).  She immediately started getting better and looked much better by end of the day on Sunday 10/10.  We saw the allergist on Wednesday  10/20 and he did not believe the reaction could have been due to her egg allergy.

While patches were fading, new patches of hives in different body areas would begin to appear.  This lasted approx. four weeks.

She started at about 2:00 started to experience a slight headache and started to feel nauseous.  Then, she took some Tylenol 650 ES and she was able to sleep for a few hours.  When she woke up in the morning the headaches were getting worse as well as the nausea.  She started feeling weak and the pain on the left side had spread throughout her body and felt like she was coming down with a cold.  She read the instructions that she was given including the symptoms which was the flu-like symptoms, etc, so she felt that she was going to have this for a few days.  By mid-afternoon the headaches were getting even worse and still feeling weak and taking Tylenol and resting.  By early evening about 5-6 she started vomiting and by that time she was very weak.  She was shivering with chills, had a fever and cold sweats and the headaches were even worse.  She did her best not to go to the hospital.  She was like this for a few days and continued to vomit and was loosing weight and was only on fluids due to the vomiting.  This continued for 2 weeks, and had some periods were it was not so bad.  After about a month she called her doctors office and scheduled an appointment as she was so weak and could not keep food down and still having the severe headaches.  When she went to the doctor he informed her not to take the 2nd vaccine, and he sent her home and told her if it continued to see him again or go to the ER.  He told her to see her neurologist for the headaches.  She went to see her neurologist the next day who gave her magnesium intravenously, nerve block injections and explained to him that this was since 4/4/21.  The following day she called him back as the nerve block and IV did not help as she was still weak and vomiting.  She then called her PCP who told her to go to the hospital where she was admitted.  She was given IV's.  By that time when they weighed her she had lost 8#.  She was in the hospital for 7 days and they finally submitted.  When she was discharged she was still having nausea but she was feeling better, she was still having headaches, but not as severe.  She waited so long as she felt that it was going to get better.  When she was discharged she was still weak, still had the body aches, was not feeling like herself, and she did not have much appetite.  She was having days about once a week or two weeks that she would vomit and continued with the nausea even with her favorite foods. She is a worship leader and was very busy with her church and had to take a leave as she was not able to sing and her throat was hurting a lot, which she contributed to the vomiting.  She then scheduled to see a specialist, allergist who specialized in voice.  She then had a scope done and he told her that she would not be able to sing for about a month and put her on medication.  She was informed that due to the vomiting that she developed reflux which was in her voicebox, and also laryngitis.  She also had periods when she would loose her voice completely.  He put her on two different medications and continued to see him until she was better.  When she last saw him she was told that the reflux was better, but her VM was still not right.    She used to walk a lot, which is her choice of her exercise and now since the vaccine she can only walk 5 blocks and cannot due to the fatigue.    She has tired that she is tired and can just sleep for long periods of time and lethargic.   She also continues to have the headaches are mild, but different from her migraine headaches and feels that they are due to the vaccine.

The patient is a 55 Years-old Female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety/depression, overweight who presented with acute shortness of breath. 2 weeks prior to admission she filled her routine prescription for hydroxychloroquine for her rheumatoid arthritis, however husband reports that she stopped taking this and started taking a supplement from another country called RT King and reported improvement in arthritis symptoms.  She also had congestion and sore throat around this time and tested herself for Covid with a home test that was negative. Shortly after this she was performing her job as a provider for patient that passed away from Covid and attended the funeral.  On 9/8 she reported difficulty breathing and pain in the chest and back with deep breaths.  This spontaneously resolved.  Then on 9/9 in the evening she had fever, body aches, however she attributed this to her rheumatoid arthritis and the storm pressure changes.  9/12 she felt great then played at the beach with her grandkids running around.  Then 9/12 in the evening she felt ill and took a home Covid test that was positive.  Husband took a home Covid test that was negative.  She did not initiate any outpatient care other than Mucinex and vitamin C.  9/13 in the morning she had difficulty breathing, hyperventilating, blue lips, diffuse body pain, feeling very weak to stand.  She was not drinking or caring for herself.  She was able to walk to the truck.  Her family brought her to the ER freestanding.  At the freestanding ER, she had initiated and tested positive for flu and negative for Covid by antigens.  Covid PCR later returned negative.  She was transferred to the main ER and desaturated during the transport and stopped breathing.  She maintained a pulse.  In the ER she was intubated.  Pressors Were Started to Maintain MAP. CTA was negative for PE, however ED physician and family practice physician clinically suspected PE and that there could be multiple small thrombi in the lungs rather than a large PE detectable by CTA.  She was started on heparin drip.  ICU accepted the patient and began management. She tested negative for COVID IgM antibodies and positive for COVID IgG antibodies. She devloped DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). During the hospital course she had sputum and blood cultures positive for streptoccocus pneumonia. She later had pseudomonas VAP and Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia. She had failure of lungs, liver, and kidneys. She was treated with maximal critical care management including broad spectrum antibiotics, ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, blood/platelet transfusions, chest tube, OG tube feedings, and anticoagulation initially that was later discontinued. She had minimal responsiveness to pain only after sedation withdrawal and was unable to breath spontaneously. On 10/9 the family agreed to palliative vent withdrawal and she expired.

By 7p I had chills, all over body aches & a crushing headache similar to a really bad night of tequila & vodka.   I could not sleep. Couldn?t get comfortable.   But the little sleep I was able to get (again, slept on right side as it wasn?t the injection site) I?d wake up with the boney part behind my ears sore (but not sore to touch). I could also feel slight pressure in my right ear as if an earache wants to develop.

I followed appropriate precautions, and wore proper PPE during this patient encounter.    Received verbal attestation from patient that she received Pfizer but after injection administration, upon trying to reconcile the health maintenance, nurse sees that patient has documentation of Moderna as first two doses, not Pfizer. Immediately returned to patient and verified which COVID vaccine she previously received. She states that she is 95% sure it was Pfizer but she does not have her card with her today.    After some more thought, she realizes that she thinks she mixed up her husband and her cards and she truly did receive Moderna. Patient apologizes for the mix up and understands that her verbal attestation was incorrect.

She got the crutches from work and she was going to walk with the crutches to at least make sure that she would not fall. She went back to her doctor and asked if she should still get the second vaccine and her doctor said yes, she needed to get it and so the caller said okay and she got it.

No previous graft rejection episodes occurred despite inconsistent use of topical corticosteroids. There was no history of COVID-19�related illness or known exposure.

The doctor prescribed Motrin, and patient got some relief, but not full relief. patient still feeling pain and aches. Her doctor told her it was arthritis and has nothing to do with the Covid 19 vaccine. Her doctor gave her some exercise papers too. Her doctor was mostly concerned with her blood pressure. Motrin tablet 600mg take one tablet every 6 hours. It's in a pharmacy bottle. Caller can't read the bottle, she has the wrong glasses. She's going to get her other glasses to read the bottle. Caller can't locate on the pharmacy bottle NDC/Lot/Expiry. Is this pain just arthritis or is it the Covid 19 vaccine. What are the ingredients in the vaccine. Her doctor told her she could take Tylenol also but she hasn't tried that yet. The pain in the left side of her body is midway down. From her shoulder down. It's not sharp pains, just annoying pains. She called her sister and her sister told her she might have some side effects but she doesn't know. When probing for medical history and concomitant medications she reports she does have a history of arthritis like when she wakes up in the morning she has a stiffness in her joints. She also has a history of edema in her feet and legs. She used to take Aleve and it used to help a little bit but it's not working for her headaches. It doesn't work as good like her body got used to the Aleve or she's immune to the Aleve. She has thrown the bottle to Aleve away. NDC/Lot/Expiry not known. The patient spoke to a Pfizer medical doctor. Patient feeling adverse reaction. Patient believe it was The left arm where patient received Pfizer shot 2 weeks ago and only the thing that have since from day patient was being tired. Patient was fatigue in all that. The patient had sleep and weakness. All the things went away. All of a sudden patient got this terrible pain down my back, at base on my neck and on my left arm where received the Pfizer shot (Further clarification was unknown hence captured as Unspecified shot). So, I needed to speak to someone who find out. patient wanted find out is this a reaction from the medicine or this doctor said this is arthritis. She got the Pfizer 1st shot. Also got the 2nd dose 12Apr. Reported that had both doses of COVID vaccine. After each dose had tiredness and chills. With 2nd dose had those symptoms plus headache that wont go away. Wondering if it was a delayed reaction. Still have the headache. Read somewhere that headache can be fatal within 6 months. Was taking Motrin and Tylenol someone told her ephedrine is better. Her sister thinks she might have diabetes. Also has eye problems and Dr told her might have arthritis in her neck.  They told her would have side effects, but the side effects are bothering her so much. She's having these headaches that won't let up. She is having to take Motrin or Tylenol or some kind of an eye pill and it would go away, but the headache will come back. She explained because everything else she was fine with. Caller states that the headaches are not severe, just annoying. She always gets the headache in the front of her head, but it rotates and will go in the back of her head on both sides, but it always seems to be more on the left side. It moves around, she sometimes it's in her left eye, she doesn't have it as bad in her right eye. Caller adds her eye doctor did tell her she has a cataract a long time ago and also she has an astigmatism in her eye. She was wondering when she took the Pfizer COVID vaccine and the headache that they said she would experience and it was still lingering on,  is the vaccine causing the headache? She wants to know what's going on. The patient has been taking Motrin and Tylenol but she stopped taking that because it seems like she just gets sore. She clarifies it seems like the left side of her neck gets sore and going down the side of her back gets sore. But she was mainly worried about the headaches. She wanted someone to talk to her and tell her if this could be from the Pfizer vaccine and tell her what to do about it. Caller explained she uses a shopping cart to do her groceries and the doctor said the soreness could have come from her using her shopping cart and picking it up and taking it up the stairs. The doctor thinks maybe she pulled muscles in the sides her neck and in her back doing that. Caller states it could be like an ache from that. She also sleeps on her side at night, so she could have pulled a muscle from the way she sleeps. However, the caller is worried about the headaches. Caller stated that the headache could be a number of things. She explained to him the headache has remained with her from her first and second dose, it has never stopped. The headache started the second week after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The headache is not getting any better, it feels like it's staying the same. She explains it is a nauseating, annoying, achy headache. The headache slows down if she takes Motrin or Tylenol or an eye supplement but it will come back hours later. She clarifies when she takes either Motrin, Tylenol or the eye medication, the headache doesn't come right back, it is delayed some hours, but the headache doesn't leave permanently. Caller states that she needs her glasses to see the immunization card, caller states that she has a lot of things going on with her eyes, her eyes are not that strong. Caller again states the only time her headache will leave her is if she takes a Motrin, or Tylenol, or some kind of eye vitamin, so once she takes, it will subside. She really went to the doctor for muscular aches because she was having it Monday down her back and that's why the doctor assumed it came from the caller using her shopping cart and picking up heavy things. The doctor thinks she has arthritis from that.  Caller states that she took the flu shot in February or March of this year 2021 and the only thing she had was a little muscular pain in shoulder. She didn't have any headaches or anything like that. NDC, Lot number expiry date is unknown for the flu vaccine. She adds that she did have a hip pain. She went to the doctor about that, and had x-rays taken on her right side of her hip and that was right after she got the flu shot. Her doctor never did mention the results of the X-ray, but the caller explains it was probably arthritis from her hip on her right side. She still gets stiffness in her joints. It hasn't really left, it's not that painful. When she gets up in the morning, she has that stiffness and soreness and it's just in her hip. She can work through that. She went to see her first and she was telling her that she thinks it is the arthritis, she did not think it was the Pfizer, she did not believe that the headache and pain are coming from Pfizer, the doctor thought she just has arthritis. Caller says she has a shopping cart that she uses to carry groceries or whatever she needs to put in there and sometimes it gets heavy and her doctor said if she is driving that around she may have been pulling a muscle and causing the pain, the doctor did not believe it was the shot.  She got the first dose on the 22Mar2021. She says she will be 74 on her birthday, she was 73 when this started. She got the vaccine at the convention center. It just says CCVC, it does have clinic site, but it has Pfizer 22Mar2021 then it says CCVC. They put a label on it, some kind of label stamped so it may be covering up something. She got tested, they did a blood test months back that came back positive, she didn't have sugar. She has not had her eyes examined, but she is 73 years old and it is possible she has eye problems, possibly degenerative macular, when people get older that can happen. She clarifies the blood work she mentioned was to check for diabetes and she clarifies it was negative, she does not have diabetes but she does not know if she is still negative, she has not been retested, she is 73 now, that test was done when she was 72. She says the  eye doctor said she may have degenerative macular because that happens to older people but he said she don't have it, she was thinking the headache could have come from that but who knows. She was told she should set up an eye doctor appointment but she has not done it yet, they told her she should to see if she is okay. She does not know, it could be anything, she was blaming Pfizer because that is the only thing she had taken, she got the headache and then she got muscular pain, and chills and she thought oh my God this must be from the Pfizer shot so she was blaming that. Primary Care: She went to see her first and she was telling her that she thinks it is the arthritis, she did not think it was the Pfizer, she did not believe that the headache and pain are coming from Pfizer, the doctor thought she just has arthritis. Caller says she has a shopping cart that she uses to carry groceries or whatever she needs to put in there and sometimes it gets heavy and her doctor said if she is driving that around she may have been pulling a muscle and causing the pain, the doctor did not believe it was the shot.

The headache started the second week after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The headache is not getting any better, it feels like it's staying the same.

This numbness was off and on and still persists today, almost two months after the shot.  The second week after the shot I started developing chest pains around the heart that intensified as the days went on.  I also had shooting pains in my heart.  I ended up visiting the ER on September 22nd as I was concerned I was having some sort of cardiac event.  Several tests were run and I was discharged to go home and consult with a cardiologist.  I began taking ibuprofen which seemed to offer some relief.  I spoke with my primary care doctor and he reviewed my test results and suggested everything was fine.  I had pushed for an echo in the ER and they would not do it.  So I asked him if he thought it was a value and he ordered one.  On October 1st I had an echo cardiogram done and according to my doctor there was no significant findings.  I did however have a low EF 50-55% which seems low for a triathlete like myself.  My doctor again suggested things were ok and I pushed for a stress test which he agreed to.  I did not do the stress test but I set up an appointment with a cardiologist to find out what is going on.  I had the appointment on October 18th and after speaking with him and having look over all my test results he determined that I most likely have pericarditis that at the top of the list of causes is the recent covid vaccine.  He said the numbness in my arm could also be caused by the inflammation around my heart.  He prescribed that I up my dosage of ibuprofen to 1200mg/day and follow up in a month.  I am a healthy active adult who trains and races in triathlons.  I had no health issues leading up to the covid vaccine.

It radiates from vaccine location up through the shoulder and sometimes down her middle finger.  It always hurts and it radiates from the injection site itself and makes her shoulder and movement hurt.  The arm is significantly weaker now, and sometimes when picking up things she cannot lift them.  It also feels a little bit numb, and prior to the vaccine she did not have any problems.  This happened immediately after receiving the vaccine, and it still radiates from the same spot.  She believes that it was the administration of the shot but not the vaccine itself.  She believes that it was too high on the shoulder itself since the pain radiates from that location.  Her should still has the ongoing pain and has nights were she cannot sleep as she cannot lie on that shoulder.  She props her arm up on a pillow and is able to get some relief.   She has to bunch up pillows on her head to be able to lie on her shoulder to sleep.

Mild flu-like symptoms in the evenings at the onset of sore throat.  After a visit to my primary physician, an ultrasound showed multiple nodes on my thyroid gland, and was prescribed four days of prednisone to ""calm it down"".  Felt good for about 6 days and then the soreness returned in my throat/neck area.  I was referred to an endocrinologist to have a closer look at the largest node of 1.6 cm.  I was unable to see the endocrinologist until October 12th.    I was scheduled to take my second shot on September 11, 2021, and I took it on September 12, 2021.   I have typical second covid-19 vaccine symptoms that lasted only about 12 hours.  However, the days following my throat became more and more tender, sore and at times throbbed.  I began to have evening flu-like symptoms to the point of taking medication to mitigate fever, aches, and chills.   I began researching thyroid symptoms from the website and felt that maybe I was suffering from Subacute Thyroiditis.  The treatment was high doses of aspirin or ibuprofen.  On October 4th I began taking 600 mg of ibuprofen each day at 1:00 p.m.    I discontinued this Sunday, October 10, 2021, and was surprised that my symptoms did not return.  I saw the endocrinologist on October 12th, where I underwent blood testing and ultrasound to determine what might be going on. The endocrinologist confirmed that I indeed had Subacute Thyroiditis.  Due to the fact that I have no family history and no previous history of thyroid issues, he diagnosis was that it was related to me taking the covid-19 vaccine.",,,,,,,,,U,08/14/2021,08/23/2021,9,blood tests and ultrasound and manual examination,PHM,,"Vitamin D, multi-vitamin and low dose aspirin",fluid on ears,none,,,2,10/19/2021,,Y,,none

The patient also did not call in on Friday afternoon complaining of any pain.   Patient called in the morning of October 18th complaining of pain in the same shoulder she received the flu shot in, telling MA she believed it was from the vaccine she got on Friday. MA made her appointment to see APRN the next day 10/19/2021 as APRN was doing the COAT program on Monday. Patient then called the next morning, Tuesday October 19th letting us know she was seen in the ER of Medical Center the night before and canceled her appointment for that day with APRN. Patient sent a MyChart message a few hours later at 11:35 that read:  ""Good morning Doctor   I am following up with your office after a flu shot visit with the nurse on Friday. I have been to the Medical Center emergency room yesterday and they confirmed that the shot was given too high on the shoulder and grazed the bursa sac. My shoulder swelled and was very tender on the top of my shoulder.  I had no range of motion and could not lift anything of weight. They gave me a shot of Toradol along with a prescription for it. Told me to keep it in the sling and ice it. He gave me a referral to an orthopedic, if it becomes necessary. I'm just following up to let you know that this happened. Everyone makes mistakes, with that said,  maybe  it would be good for you to address it with her. I will let you know if I continue to have problems and if indeed I do need to go to the orthopedist.  Thank you.""  The message was forwarded to APRN who reached out to the patient - thanking her for letting her know and that some education would be reinforced.

She linked it to vaccine side effects & said my menstrual cycle would go back to normal in 3 months. 4/30/21 | Second covid Pfizer vaccine, breakthrough bleeding/periods continues. Throughout May, hard pieces of skin begin developing on the peaks of upper lips. As time continues, those hard/dry patches move to the sides of my nose, then back to my lips, and so on. 6/21/21 Severe burning/pain while urinating, I had assumed it was just linked to the ongoing menstrual issues. 7/4/21 Upper and lower lips becoming increasingly dry and chapped. Start experiencing a few days of extreme lethargy. (this will start to become 1-2x a week from here on out). 7/25/21 � 7/29/21 Severe vaginal burning/irritation.

Teledoc appointment - was told this could be a systemic yeast infection. Prescribed Mupirocin and Ketoconazole topicals. Called OB to update her, she agreed that it was a systemic yeast infection and told me to continue topicals. Prescribed fluconazole 150mg once every 6 days for 4 weeks. Touchbase with GP to fill her in, she agrees with the above diagnosis. 8/11/21 � 9/19/21. Some relief on both upper and lower lips, but continued severe dryness in addition to a more pronounced, red lip line. Severe eye/throat irritation (itchiness, dryness) Menstrual cycle has returned to normal. 9/22/21 � 9/26/21Major upper and lower lip flare-up. Severe swelling, itching, burning, in addition to 3 key locations with pus (peaks on upper lips + middle of lower lip).

After further discussion, also took bacterial culture to rule out bacterial infection. Throughout the week, lethargy is increased to 3-4 days as well as pretty bad chills. 10/1/21 Culture Results: Heavy growth of Serratia Liquefaaciens. Dermatologists takes me off zyrtec + desonide, prescribes Gentamicin. Discuss results with GP, she refers me to an Infectious Disease doctor. Recommended to MD to get blood work/culture & urine tested to have all results in time for ID appointment. Temperature 99.3. Blood Sugar 49. All other results were normal 10/4/21 - 10/5/21: Burning and itching on upper lip, turning into some small blistering outside of the lip line. Dermatologist followed up with additional results which showed yeast growth. She wants to take a viral culture, switch me to an oral antibiotic and put me on nystatin anti-fungal topical. 10/6/21 Allergist Appointment: Doctor does not think it's cold sores since nothing has ever scabbed over. He says there is skin sloughing although unsure as to what is causing it.  Took a bacterial culture, and will be doing a patch test on 10/11/21 to rule out any eczema or chemical allergy.  10/7/21 Dermatologist Follow up: Dual-treatment medication (topical, gentamicin 3x a day & oral, levofloxacin 750mg) for a week.  He would potentially recommend a lip biopsy, but is deferring to the Infectious Disease doctor's treatment plan. 10/8/21 Worst flare up yet, really swollen and raw lips/face. Super painful, really itchy, almost went to ER. 10/11/21 Allergist appointment for patch test. 10/13/21 Allergist appointment, patch test & culture results. Very few allergies shown from patch test, which confirms that there is no allergy correlation to what's been happening on my lips. Culture results showed moderate yeast growth, and no serratia growth. He is deferring to the ID for treatment. 10/15/21 Infectious Disease Appointment: Thinks Serratia + Yeast are secondary infections from an underlying cause. Prescribed Fluconazole 100mg 1x a day for 7 days, as well as topical (using ketoconazole in the meantime) 2x a day for 7 days. Did bloodwork to test for vitamin levels / tb.

Later around 1pm the itchy feeling and discomfort became worse and I then noticed that it was getting more and it was spreading now also turning into welts. After that I noticed it was showing signs of getting worse I purchased some Zertac and took a cold shower and put non-scented lotion over the affected areas of body. At 3pm I noticed that the hives had begun to go away and the welts were diminishing as well. By 6pm all of the hives were completely gone with just minor irritation on the skin if something rubbed on a previously affected area. Next day (10/17/2021) I developed the hives again at around 24hrs after taking the Zertac the day before. So at approximately 3pm 10/17/2021) the hives had begun to spread again but this time they were concentrated around my legs and feet and were no longer mainly on my upper body, there were still some on my arms though. I took a Zertac later that night and did not suffer from any more hives the next day (10/18/2021) besides some minor irritation here or there.

That was all night long and I didn't feel the greatest and I had a little bit to eat for dinner. Next morning was the same. Saturday and Sunday both my stomach was just off and I didn't feel that great but I know they said this can be a symptom. Monday morning I woke up and had terrible time breathing, chest pain, and back pain, so I thought I had a bad reaction. I laid on the couch and took Tylenol every 6 hours and Tuesday morning I woke up and still couldn't breathe and chest and back pain. I Called my daughter and told her I needed to go to DR and She picked me up and parked as close as she could and I had a terrible time getting to car. She got me to ER and they got me in and hooked me up to monitors and told me I was in afib and had heart failure. Because I am on dialysis I'm on transplant list and I get tested every year for cardiac test and I got last one at the end of December and echo and stress test and CT of heart and they all came out good with no issues other than milk calcium build up with age. The doctors tried to convert me out of afib at  hospital and tried twice and couldn't get me out of it and  I was there a couple days. They transferred me to another hospital and they got me out of afib and put a pacemaker in and got me stabilized and 4 days later they were gonna send me home and I told them I didn't feel good and so they did another echo and found out I had fluid on heart and so they took me in and drained 280 mL of fluid off heart and had trouble getting BP to stay up so I stayed in more days and then was transferred to rehab center for 2 weeks. None of this would've happened if I hadn't had the other but the rehab center wasn't very clean because I came home and 4 days later was in hospital again with e-coli and was in hospital in anther 10 days and had a gastro tube put in twice and bunch of antibiotics. I came home and was home one day and went back to hospital for c-diff and I was in there for another 10 days and they put me in another rehab for 2 weeks and I finally came home. So between March 16 ? June 12 I was back and forth in the hospital and on June 12 I was finally home. I've had home physical therapy and I still haven't gotten back all my strength and I have issues with my breathing. The pacemaker is working so they don't figure I'll go into afib again since I have the pacemaker. My cardiologist said she has had several patients end up with myocarditis and I thought maybe it had something to do with kidney disease but many of her patients aren't kidney patients so it isn't just part of a kidney disease problem. It also started really right away so it wouldn't have had time to get into my system and filter with my kidneys.

1798928,10/19/2021,MN,6.0,6,,M,,"Patient received his MMR and Varivax vaccination this morning. Within minutes of receiving the vaccination, patient apparently did well and got up to leave. As he was walking out mom reports that she noticed his eyes were rolled back in his head and he went down.  He fell backwards on the floor in the exam room.  The nurse was present within seconds herself as she was still just about leaving the room when this occurred.  She states that she noticed him lying on the floor and his extremities were a little stiff. However, within yet another 20 seconds I was in the room 2. By this time, he was awake. He looked a little confused, but he was awake, and he responded appropriately. His pulse ox was maintained at 98 to 99% on room air. Blood pressure was initially high at 130/80 but this then settled down to 112/78.  He was alert and aware. He recognized his mom. He responded appropriately when I asked to see if he could get up. Patient not just sat up but got all the way up to standing and walked over to his mom and sat on the bench seat.  He then had a juice box without any difficulty. Blood sugars were not obtained. No labs were done. Patient came around and continued to act his normal self thereafter. I did discuss with mom father, and it appears patient had not had any breakfast before coming into the clinic this morning.  She states that he was on an empty stomach. Also, patient was able to explain to mom and described that everything that somewhat dark and black in front of him before he fell down.  Thus, based on this it sounds more like he passes out phenomena than his seizure.  In any case mom noticed very concerned about the possibility of seizure as she witnessed this stiffening of his arms. Also, she witnessed his eyes rolling back. This I have placed a referral for patient to be seen by neurology. At this time, I reassured mom that this could very well be a vaccination response to a particular vaccine or perhaps it was a pain effect or passing out.  However, mom states that patient does have high pain threshold. Regardless due to the seizure-like phenomena that was witnessed, I have elected to send patient to neurology as well for evaluation. Meanwhile I have advised that patient can go home but we will do follow-up calls today to ensure he is doing fine. Advised to call us if he should develop vomiting or emergence of any other new symptoms or concerns. Mom is to monitor him closely for the rest of the day. Mom agrees.  Thank you. 1 mom was out of the car with the patient he apparently had one episode of emesis went to a little pale and said he could not walk anymore. Thus, mom turned around and brought him right back into the clinic.  This time I evaluated him again. He answers questions appropriately. And he cried stating he was scared.  He said he felt he could not walk. Thus, at this time considering he has had the head injury with falling backwards on the clinic for, and the fact that he has had one episode of emesis, I elected to send him by nonemergent ambulance to the hospital for further evaluation. Patient has been sent to the hospital and I have called the Hospital intake stop advising them of the incident today that led to the events that followed and felt that he needed further evaluation especially considering the head injury and the vomiting now. Mom agrees with this plan as well.  Thank you",,,,,,,,,N,10/19/2021,10/19/2021,0,"Went to the ER on 10/19/2021, had a CT of his head.",PVT,,NONE,NONE,NONE,,,2,10/19/2021,,,Y,NONE

The patient was in her usual state of health, and enjoying her life. Information about history condition and concomitant medication was not reported.On 28-AUG-2015, during a routine visit to discuss birth control, the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) (strength, dose, route, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for preventing cervical cancer, in light of the physician's recommendations, as well as relentless marketing and advertising messages. Within a month of receiving the first dosage of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL), the patient developed symptoms of fatigue, headaches, joint pains, dizziness, and brain fog. On 27-OCT-2015(also reported as 27-OCT-2915, inconsistent information), the patient returned to the physician's office to receive her second dosage of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) (strength, dose, route, lot # and expiration date were not reported). Immediately following the shot, the patient became suddenly dizzy and felt intense pain in her arm where the vaccine had been administered. The patient was instructed to sit in a chair for a few minutes until she felt well enough to walk out of the office. The pain in her arm and the dizziness continued for many days. The patient also continued to experience severe joint pains, which eventually worked their way into her jaw. The left side of her jaw would ache until she could not eat or speak. The patient saw her dentist and was diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). In October 2015, the patient quit her job due to fatigue, dizziness, and generalized pain. The physical fatigue and mental brain fog she experienced made doing even the simplest tasks nearly impossible. By February 2016, the patient was experiencing increasingly severe stomach pains and nausea. She also suddenly developed anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. She had to miss school or leave early from her classes because she was in so much pain that she couldn't focus or would have a panic attack in the middle of class. The patient stopped being able to drive to school and she had to rely on her father for a ride. On 14-MAR-2016, the patient returned to her physician's office, for her third and final dosage of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) (strength, dose, route, lot # and expiration date were not reported). On 27-MAR-2016, the patient woke up with a patch of hair missing from the top of her head. She had a bald spot the size of a quarter right above her forehead, and the spot continued to grow over the days until it was about 2 inches in diameter. The patient was diagnosed with random onset alopecia areata. In May 2016, the patient was very ill with stomach pains and nausea. She was suddenly unable to eat or drink anything despite being hungry and wanting to eat. She could not swallow anything. She went from doctor to doctor trying to find answers for around two weeks until she finally had a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan. It was found that her gall bladder was deemed ""non-functioning"" at zero percent. On 13-JUN-2016, an emergency surgery was performed to remove the gall bladder. After the surgery, the patient was able to eat again, but her abdominal pain persisted and in fact worsened. As the months progressed, so did the patient's injuries. She was seen by multiple physicians and specialists for her complaints which now included: dizziness, brain fog, joint pains, swallowing issues, breathing difficulties, fatigue, hair loss, severe stomach issues, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, muscle weakness, severe weight loss, insomnia, tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) behaviors. As a result of her post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms, the patient was unable to engage in normal activities that a young adult would enjoy. She could no longer be physically active, nor participate in the activities that she used to. The patient has taken time off from college and has put her dreams of working in the film industry on hold to focus on her health. Based upon her chronic and severe post- quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms and adverse events as outlined above, and the tests performed by her medical providers, the patient had been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), dysautonomia, alopecia areata, biliary dyskinesia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), bile acid malabsorption (BAM), and TMJ. The patient had suffered and continued to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries and associated symptomology and had suffered severe and permanent emotional injuries, including pain and suffering. The patient also had a substantial fear of suffering additional and ongoing harms, including but not limited to now being at an increased risk of cancer and future symptoms and harms associated with her autoimmune disease and other injuries caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL).As a direct and proximate result of her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL)-induced injuries, the patient had suffered and continued to suffer economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, and diminished income capacity, and she (also reported as he, inconsistent information) would continue to incur these losses and expenses in the future. The outcome of all events was not recovered. The causality assessment was considered to be related by the lawyer.  These events of POTS, dysautonomia, alopecia areata, biliary dyskinesia, IBS, SIBO, BAM, and temporomandibular TMJ were considered as disability by the lawyer. The event of biliary dyskinesia was determined to be medically significant because the surgery of remove the gall bladder was on supplemental surgical and medical procedures always serious terms list.",,,,,,,,Y,N,08/28/2015,03/27/2016,212,,PVT,,,,,,US0095075132110USA002785,2,10/19/2021,,Y,,

Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology 2021; 17(1): 98.  This literature marketed report has been received from the authors of a published literature article, titled as stated above, and refers to a 27-year-old male patient who, in June of 2017, started having recurrent episodes of pneumonia and was found to have thrombocytopenia. He complained of recurrent productive cough with green discharge over 1.5 years. His other concurrent conditions included: intermittent headaches, sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, intermittent diarrhea, fatigue and loss of smell, however he denied any fever, chills or night sweats. At the start of his disease course, the patient had lost around 10-11 pounds. His family history was pertinent for a brother who also had thrombocytopenia and died from a brain aneurysm.  The patient underwent hematologic monitoring of his platelet counts over a 12 month which showed varying levels between 91 and 108 � 10^9/L. The rest of his complete blood count (CBC) with differential, complete metabolic panel and urinalysis were normal. The patient was also found to have hypogammaglobulinemia. Quantitative immunoglobulin panels were completed four times over an additional 12-month period revealing the following: IgG 256-308 mg/dl (700-1600), IgM 9-25 (40-230), IgA 23-33 (70-400). A computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen revealed mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and multiple pulmonary nodules.  In May 2018, the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) and in June 2018, he received the second dose of pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) for prophylaxis due to his hypogammaglobulinemia (exact doses, site and route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported). In July 2018, the patient was referred to pulmonary clinic for a lung biopsy due to concerns about tuberculosis (TB), fungal infections, malignancy and granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis as a potential underlying cause of the findings. His pulmonary function tests showed moderate reduction of airflow (FEV1/FVC: 59%), normal vital capacity and moderate reduction of diffusion capacity, which were consistent with obstructive lung disease. He underwent bronchoscopy and ultrasound guided endobronchial lymph node biopsy twice in the summer of 2018. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with multiple node biopsies were negative for bacterial, fungal and TB as a cause of lung disease. Testing was also negative for malignancy. He was started on fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium and vilanterol for further management with improvement in FEV1/FVC ratio. He received isavuconazonium sulfate as treatment for a possible aspergillus infection due to a positive aspergillus galactomannan test. His antifungal treatment was continued for 5 weeks but was stopped in November 2018 secondary to side effects (elevated liver enzymes, nausea, and vomiting).  In December 2018, a repeat CT chest showed progression of multifocal nodularity in his lung and unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy. In January 2019, he underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) guided lung biopsy of his superior right lower lung that showed lymphoid hyperplasia with interstitial fibrosis, patchy foci of organizing pneumonia, rare giant cells/histiocytes, acute bronchopneumonia and occasional fibrin exudates.  In January 2019, the patient was evaluated in the allergy and immunology clinic for immunodeficiency. A physical examination showed the following: vital signs: blood pressure 110/80, pulse 64/minute, temperature 97 degrees, respiratory rate (RR) 18/minute. Ears, nose, throat (ENT) exam showed bilateral swollen pale nasal turbinate with light yellow drainage. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. Repeat laboratory testing was ordered and showed a platelet count of 96K. The tests for comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, stool ova and parasites and HIV were all negative. An immunoglobulin panel showed an IgM 10 (40-230 mg/dl), IgG 520 (700-1600 mg/dl), IgA 26 (70-400 mg/dl), IgE less than 2 (0-158 mg/dl). Lymphocyte subsets were as followed: absolute lymphocyte: 1126 (1000-4000), CD3: 935 (960-2600) [83% (61-84)], CD4: 586 (540-1660) [52% (32-60)], CD8: 304 (270-930) [27 (13-40%)], CD19: 79 (122-632) [7% (3-22)], CD16 + 56: 90 (70-480) [8% (3-22)]. A lymphocyte mitogen screen showed a low to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and a normal Concanavalin A (Con A) and Pokeweed Mitogen. A sinus X-ray was remarkable for left maxillary sinus disease showing mucosal thickening. Despite being vaccinated the patient had poor pneumococcal antibody titers with only 2/14 equal or greater than 1.3 microgram/ml being responsive (antibody test abnormal). His tetanus antibody titer was in the protective range of 1.3.  Based on his low IgG and IgA, recurrent infections and failure to respond to pneumococcal vaccination (vaccination failure), the patient was diagnosed with the common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with coexisting immune thrombocytopenia and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD). The patient was treated for CVID with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 30 g every 4 weeks with subsequent increase to 50 g every 4 weeks because of decreasing lung function and decreased platelet count. He remained infection free since November 2018. In January 2020, his follow up chest X-ray and CT chest in showed further widespread lymphadenopathy and nodular lung densities. He was to start treatment with rituximab (RITUXAN) and mycophenolate mofetil for GLILD however while waiting for treatment he tested positive for COVID-19. He slowly recovered without any complication at home and was eventually able to start rituximab (RITUXAN) infusion of 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks and completed four cycles of therapy without complication. At the time of reporting, he was on maintenance mycophenolate mofetil 1 g and monthly IVIG and was doing well. The outcome of vaccination failure and antibody test abnormal was unknown. The authors considered poor pneumococcal antibody titers and failure to respond to pneumococcal vaccination to be related to the patient's underlying common variable immunodeficiency and pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23).

Company causality between Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s, and suspected immunological vaccine failure was not related.  The authors concluded, the findings of low antispike antibodies in patients undergone HCT and receiving CAR T-cell therapy after COVID-19 vaccination suggest that such patients might remain at high risk of COVID-19 infection despite vaccination. The results observed in this study underscore the importance of masking, social distancing, and household vaccination for patients undergoing HCT and receiving CAR T-cell therapy, even after vaccination. Additional studies examining the wider immune repertoire with characterization of memory B- and T-cell immune responses over time and neutralizing antibody capacity are needed to better assess immunological response.

No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   No treatment information was provided.  They calculated incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of myocarditis using vaccine administration as the denominator and compared it with the incidence of myocarditis in unexposed individuals between 14-Dec-202 and 20-Jul-2020; and with vaccinated individuals during a 10 day period 1 year prior to vaccination.  There were 15 cases of confirmed myocarditis in the vaccinated group (2 after the first dose and 13 after the second).  Of the patients with myocarditis post vaccination, no one had prior cardiac disease.  Fourteen (93%) reported chest pain between 1 to 5 days after vaccination. Symptoms resolved with conservative management in all cases; no patients required intensive care unit admission or readmission after discharge.  Author concluded that In this population-based cohort study of 2,392,924 individuals who received at least 1 dose ofCOVID-19mRNAvaccines, acute myocarditis was rare, at an incidence of 5.8 cases per 1 million individuals after the second dose (1 case per 172,414 fully vaccinated individuals). The signal of increased myocarditis in young men warrants further investigation.  This vaccinated cohort is unique in its racial and ethnic diversity and in receiving care at community hospitals with treatment reflective of real-world practice. Limitations of this study include the observational design; short follow-up time; absence of myocardial biopsy for definitive diagnosis; lack of uniform testing of all cases; possible more extensive workup of chest pain in vaccinated individuals during the immediate post-vaccination period; and possible under-diagnosis of subclinical cases. No relationship between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and post-vaccination myocarditis can been established given the observational nature of this study.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.   The patient's past medical history included Keratoplasty (Patient had contact lens related Aspergillus keratitis 3 years ago, requiring tectonic sclerokeratoplasty of the superotemporal quadrant followed 6 months later by optical penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) with extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens placement.).

On an unknown date, the patient experienced CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION (Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (declining vision of 2-day duration on the operated eye.).

At the time of the report, CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION (Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (declining vision of 2-day duration on the operated eye.) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Corneal pachymetry: cct measured 752 um). CCT measured 752 um). and decreased CCT decreased to 610 mm. On an unknown date, Slit-lamp examination: slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival in Slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival inflammation, a corneal endothelial rejection line with fresh KP. On an unknown date, Visual acuity tests: normal BCVA returned to 20/40 with a clear compact cornea graft devoid of neovascularization, bcva was reduced to 20/80 BCVA was reduced to 20/80 and increased vision improved to 20/60.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION (Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (declining vision of 2-day duration on the operated eye.) to be possibly related.    This case concern 2 out of 4 patients with prior keratoplasty developed presumed immunologic rejection after the mRNA-1273 vaccination for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One year before current presentation, accidental blunt trauma resulted in limited keratoplasty wound dehiscence with uneventful repair.  The patient received the first dose of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) without incident and, accordingly, 4 weeks later received the second vaccine dose. She presented 1 week later complaining of declining vision of 2-day duration on the operated eye. Prednisolone acetate 1% was increased to hourly frequency, and on this regimen, at 6-week follow-up, vision improved to 20/60, with resolution of conjunctival inflammation, KPs, and endothelial rejection line. Topical steroids were tapered to prednisolone acetate 1% 4 times daily.  These cases suggest acute corneal endothelial rejection may occur soon after either dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Prompt initiation of aggressive topical steroid therapy may result in complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the causal mechanism of corneal graft rejection after COVID-19 vaccination.   This case concerns a 61-year-old, female patient with medical history of keratoplasty with extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens placement 3 years ago, and subsequent keratoplasty wound dehiscence after a accidental blunt trauma with clear compact cornea graft placement a year ago,  who experienced the unexpected serious event of corneal graft rejection together with non-serious unexpected event of visual impairment. The event of corneal graft rejection occurred approximately 1 week after the first dose of Spikevax (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; according to narrative, with administration date unknown).

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.       The patient's past medical history included Keratoplasty. Concurrent medical conditions included Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Salzmann nodular degeneration and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy.   On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 1. On an unknown date, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 1. On an unknown date, the patient experienced CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION (Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (declining vision in the left eye). The patient was treated with PREDNISOLONE ACETATE for Cystoid macular edema, at an unspecified dose and frequency and DIFLUPREDNATE for Cystoid macular edema, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION (Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (declining vision in the left eye) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Ophthalmological examination: 719 micrometer 719 micrometer and increased 633 micrometer CCT 633 micrometer. On an unknown date, Slit-lamp examination: slitlamp examination showed conjunctival injection (abnormal) Slitlamp examination showed conjunctival injection, trace anterior chamber cells. On an unknown date, Visual acuity tests: bcva was 20/25 in each eye BCVA was 20/25 in each eye, decreased BCVA was reduced to 20/50 in the involved eye and normal Within 3 weeks, BCVA in the left eye recovered to 20/30 with resolution of anterior chamber cells.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter considered CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION (Acute Corneal Transplant Rejection) and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (declining vision in the left eye) to be possibly related.

A 43-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: Not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (age at vaccination 43 years) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included covid-19 (her family all contracting COVID-19 virus in December), Mast Cell Syndrome (she has since she was 20 years old) and inflammation from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in 2021 patient experienced facial swelling and mothers lip blew up. Patient questions if her or her daughter's reactions following dose one of the vaccine would be considered severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis. Patient was advised that the risks of BNT162B2 (Covid-19 vaccine, mRNA) and the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE include that there was a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: difficulty breathing, swelling of your face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over your body, dizziness and weakness. Strongly encouraged her to work with her provider in determining if they felt that her reaction was severe but reiterated that swelling of the face was noted as a severe allergic reaction here as stated. Patient stated that her, age 43 years old, and her daughter, age 16 years old, both received the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose 3 weeks ago. Their second dose was supposed to be received tomorrow. Mother reported her family all contracting COVID-19 virus in December. She also reported they have Mast Cell Syndrome that she had since she was 20 years old. She stated this was when her immune system overpowers itself and she expected this to happen, it was how their systems were. She also stated that they both have inflammation going on. The patient's daughter had seizures from COVID in december and they had just now gotten those under control and she continued to had ongoing inflammation problems. After receiving the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine, both the mother and the daughter, experienced facial swelling. Mother reported she was still dealing with side effects from the vaccine. The reactions did not occur immediately or within minutes of receiving the vaccine, but later that day. Patient's daughter's reaction occurred a few hours after the vaccination she stated. The daughters face swelled from her eye down to the mouth area on the left side and the mothers lip blew up. Mother did have her histamine levels checked by her HCP and they were noted to be high. Patient stated that what she was trying to figure out at that time was whether or not she/her daughter should receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine after a reaction from the 1st dose. Mother stated that she had received no guidance/direction from her provider or the health department regarding this concern. She stated she did not know what to do and stated it was their immune system going wonkey. This was great, she didn't know what to do. Dern if you do and dern if you didn't. Patient understood that an allergic reaction was something that happens fast after the vaccine but questions could it happen later. She stated that she knows the vaccine caused the swelling but only because their systems were overpowering themselves. The 16-year-old daughter wanted to get her 2nd dose because she was tired of getting quarantined due to close contact in HS. She was tired of having her life uprooted because of it. Patient advised that as noted in the fact sheet for recipients, you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision also advised the patient per the fact sheet: Contraindications: Do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Consumer stated: Mother fine for second vaccine, just a little swelling of her arm. Daughter second vaccination around 02Sep2021, she took birth control because of seizures around ovulation. She ovulated after second vaccine, causing her birth control to not work properly. Seriousness of the events was non serious.

She explains that her friend was collapsed in the bathroom, she heard a noise and so went to her friend and saw his mouth was ajar, his breathing didn't look right, his eyes were darting around and he was non responsive for about a minute to verbal commands. She went to other room to get phone because she wasn't sure. This happened within 12 hours of the receiving the shot, it was under 12 hours. The pharmacist said it could be directly be link to the shot, the pharmacist reported this. Caller asks should her friend get the second shot. Caller stated that she almost called an ambulance but then her friend came around after a minute and minute and a half. this was very scary to her. The seizure happened in the middle of the night on 18Sep2021 around 3AM. Caller was probed when the seizure started or if she knew how long it lasted, caller stated that her own reaction time was late because she was asleep, she then heard a thud, and it took time to realize and question what she heard, she then got to the nearby bathroom, and then discovered him, his body was limp, he was shallow breathing, eyes darting, he was on the floor non responsive to verbal command, but the time she got there it was about a minute and half longer. She was unsure how much longer he was laying in there before she saw him. She added that he has not fainted before like that, he has no history, this was an isolated event, he did not have any further side effect or adverse reaction after.

She had multiple hearing tests and then get worse each time instead of better and no prior hearing issues/loss prior to the Pfizer covid vaccine. She also got side effects with upper sinus congestion/nasal congestion. She had a nasal runny nose immediately after the vaccine; within 35 minutes of the vaccine and continued with her since that time and no OTC or medicine clears up the congestion. She was at the doctor today. Consumer wanted reports about hearing loss and sinus congestion, asked about nuts in the vaccine, asked about gluten in the vaccine. They had reported the tight feeling in neck and jaw and a fullness or weird feeling in head and ears to the person that gave the vaccine and was looked at following and then they were cleared he guesses. Then a week or so later ears felt clogged up, like from an elevation change or something like that, and had since been diagnosed with sudden hearing loss. It was getting very severe and had had treatment for that and there was no other explanation other than the vaccine with having the experience with this scenario. They were still seeking treatment. Consumer said any information at this point would be helpful to them since this was something brand new.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results on 05Oct2021 Unknown, urine analysis: unknown results on 05Oct2021 Unknown. The clinical outcome of the event was unknown. Summary of Investigation: The initial scope of the investigation was limited to the reported finished goods lot EW0150, fill lot EP8690, and the bulk formulated drug product lot EP8587. Based on the results of the investigation, the scope was not expanded. Manufacturing and packaging batch records, deviation investigations, analytical release test results, and an analysis of the complaint history were examined for the reported complaint lot. Pfizer  did not receive photographs or a complaint sample for examination. The complaint was not confirmed. No probable root cause for the complaint related to the manufacturing process of the reported lot was identified. There were no corrective or preventative actions taken as a result of this complaint investigation. No related quality issues were identified during the investigation. There were no planned or unplanned deviations recorded during the manufacture of the complaint lot and associated manufacturing lots that may have caused a complaint of this nature. A review of the manufacturing records confirmed processing steps were performed within pre established parameters. All raw materials and amounts used in the manufacture of the batch were of the correct weight and identity. The drug product is stored at controlled refrigeration throughout the manufacturing process and a log is maintained documenting the elapsed time out of refrigeration. A review of the elapsed time tracking logs indicated that the batch did exceed Time Out of Refrigeration limits. To analyse whether this impacted the quality of the batch, a  assessment was conducted. The assessment concluded that the RNA integrity result from Covid-19 vaccine lot EW0150 is comparable to the standard validation limits. All release testing results from EW0150 are within product release specifications. It has been identified that the product quality attribute of RNA integrity may decline as a function of temperature, the results of this product assessment has concluded that there is no impact to the product quality attributes of the complaint lot as a result of exceeding  limits. The product also requires storage in ultralow temperature freezers following the packaging of the product. A review of the freezer storage logs confirmed that all times and temperatures were within allowable limits. There is no impact to the quality of the lot. It is unknown how the product was handled, stored, or administered after it left the  site.

Medical history included renal transplant on 11Jun2018. Concomitant medication included mycophenolate mofetil taken for immunosuppression. The patient developed COVID-19 symptoms 16 days after completion of vaccination and was hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests which included nucleocapsid IgG antibody detection: negative, spike protein IgG antibody detection: negative. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of covid-19 symptoms including remdesivir. No supplemental oxygen. The outcome of event was unknown.   Here we present our early single-center experience with vaccine breakthrough and symptomatic COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) disease hospitalization rates in fully vaccinated kidney transplant recipients. A total of 166 kidney transplant recipients were diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 at our health system from March 2020 to April 2021. Of these 107 (64%) required inpatient admission and overall mortality was 11% (18/166). Three hundred and eighty (mostly age > 65 years) completed both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine by April 2021. From February to April there were 17/166 (10%) new positive documented COVID-19 cases. Among them 7/17 patients developed symptomatic disease despite being fully vaccinated suggesting an early breakthrough rate of 1.8% (7/380). Four out of seven were hospitalized; however only two developed severe COVID-19 symptoms requiring supplemental oxygenation redemsivir and dexamethasone. Further clinical details are provided in Table 1. These patients were predominately male (5/7) with a median age of 53 who received a de-ceased donor with a median time of 3 years from transplant. Majority (6/7) were maintained on triple immunosuppression with one patient taken off of anti-metabolite due to persistent BK viremia. Median time from vaccine completion to time to diagnosis was 33 days. Interestingly 3/7 patients had detectable Sars-CoV- 2 spike IgG antibody while 2/7 had both spike and nucleocapsid protein IgG at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Unfortunately quantitative antibody levels as well as SARs-CoV- 2 variant data was not available. Our early experience suggests limited early breakthrough COVID-19 in kidney trans-plant recipients who completed the two-dose SARs-CoV- 2 mRNA vaccine series despite a reported 54% antibody response. In patients who did experience vaccine breakthrough the majority did not develop severe symptoms that required inpatient admission. This may reflect a need for quantitative antibody disease protection threshold measurements as well as the importance of continued vaccine efforts among immunosuppressive patients despite the reported lower antibody response. Our results are further strengthened by a significant decline in the diagnosis of new COVID-19 cases since vaccinations started. Future studies are needed to assess newer strategies in vaccination to better protect immunosuppressed patients from preventable morbidity and mortality.

Her husband told her to call the doctor, which she did, and she had prescribed an OTC ear drop meant to clear impacted wax and went through a course of that but it did not help.  Her hearing was very bad and could not hear so she went in to see her.  She checked her and there was no impacted wax and then she felt a little better, but did not seem to find anything wrong.  About a week later it started up again and felt like her head was full of air and that she could not hear.  She then referred her to a ENT and had a complete hearing exam and they said that she had significant hearing loss in her left ear, and everything within the ear looked fine structure wise but just was not hearing.  The doctor there did prescribe a course of steroids that may help, which she took.  She went back after 2 weeks, there was a slight improvement, but still had significant hearing loss.  She is to follow up after the first of the year, but has noticed any change in her hearing. She still cannot hear, but has a constant noise like the car window is down, the noise being so loud that it's hard to hear.

I detailed side effects of 3rd dose in case relevant to adverse event.  Side effects experienced and expected below: Shivering, fever of 102.2 (my normal with that thermometer was 97.7 when not sick), could not get warm, body aches and joint pain, spo2 was 97 with prbpms at 114 at 09/30/2021 ~22:00. Nauseous when standing at some times.  Adverse Event: Back right side began to become very sore and uncomfortable. Urine began to become pink, then red, and proceeded to become a dark muddy color. Drinking lots of water would reduce it back to red or light pink but the back right side soreness/discomfort continued and if walking or bending a lot would become painful. During the time period from 10/1/2021 to 10/4/2021 I did take a dose of one ibuprofen liquid gel pill per recommended time on bottle for fever, body aches, and pain on back right side but it did not help much. Noted that bottle states 1-2 pills for adults. Since it did not seem to help I stopped taking them 10/3/2021 evening.  Blood in urine continued till 10/3/2021 in evening. During time frame tried to drink a lot of water and occasional sugar-free Gatorade. Discomfort on back right side (occasionally pain) was still bad enough that I took 10/4/2021 off work to rest.  Discomfort continued when working 10/5/2021 and 10/6/2021. Tried to go to Urgent Care night of 10/6/2021 but they were too busy after work. Went back on 10/7/2021 in morning.  Note: I had blood in urine from 2nd dose of Pfizer as well but at time I thought the urine color was due to excessive mucus drainage and did not realize it could have been blood. Only after 3rd dose where I had pain in back right and went to urgent care did I learn that it was blood & protein. In hindsight I had darker urine also in January of 2020 when I got very sick and suspect it could have been Covid-19.  Discomfort and occasional pain in back right side persists to current date. Kidney biopsy is scheduled for 10/25/2021 07:30 at  Medical Center,   Urgent Care & Eastern Nephrology Visits At urgent care they took a blood sample and urine sample. Creatinine levels were found to be high (unsure exact levels at that time) and blood & protein were found in urine. CT was done by recommendation of Dr.  to rule out kidney stones. CT results did not indicate kidney stones. Blood was drawn again and an IV of I believe saline was given to hydrate me and flush my kidneys out. Dr.  began to suspect issue was something called ?IgA Nephropathy? which, I understand from his explanation, can be an underlying problem that can be set off by the vaccine? They referred me to  Nephrology to speak with Dr.  regarding issue. Follwed up at  Urgent Care on 10/12/2021 09:00 where blood was drawn again. Creatinine levels at this time were 1.4. Was advised by Dr. , who I saw when following-up at Urgent Care, to begin taking Fish Oil Supplements for kidneys.  Went to  Nephrology 10/12/2021 14:00 and provided urine sample. Protein of sample was still found to be higher than it should be. After speaking with Dr.  he to suspected that it could be an existing, unknown to me, kidney issue called ?IgA Nephropathy? that was irritated by the vaccine. He has scheduled a kidney biopsy for me at Medical Center 10/25/2021 07:30 as he explained that?s the best way to know what?s going on and he is concerned due to protein being found in urine so long after vaccination.",,,,,,,,,N,09/30/2021,09/30/2021,0,10/7/2021 - Blood drawn - Creatinine levels were found to be high 10/7/2021 - Urine sample - Blood and protein confirmed in urine 10/7/2021 - CT to confirm issue was not kidney stones 10/7/2021 - Blood drawn 10/7/2021 - Saline IV was given to hydrate and flush out kidneys 10/12/2021 - Blood drawn and Creatinine level was 1.4 10/12/2021 - Urine sample given at  Nephrology.

I felt discomfort during the injection as the vaccine entered my arm. Within two hours post injection I felt substantial soreness in the area around the injection site. Several hours later as I attempted to change my clothing I experienced extreme pain in my upper right arm area, not soreness, while raising my right arm. My range of motion was restricted. I began taking 200 mgs of Motrin and 500 mgs of Tylenol for the pain. Within 24 hours post injection the initial injection site soreness went away as did the nausea, chills/fever; however, the  movement pain and restricted range of motion remained. I continued to take Motrin and Tylenol for several days without any pain relief or increase in range of motion. Deeply concerned I scheduled an appointment with Dr. at Orthopedic Clinic for 09/29/2021 to discuss the pain and range of motion issues that limit my ability to perform routine daily living activities. I explained I have never had any issues with my right arm/shoulder and that these problems began within hours of the vaccine injection. He diagnosed adhesive capsulitis, injected cortisone into my right shoulder area, prescribed physical therapy and a folllow-up appointment was scheduled for 11/03/2021 with (Dr. assistant). I began physical therapy on 10/07/2021. Immediately following the physical therapy my pain intensified and further restricted range of motion. Previously the pain was limited to my right upper arm. Now I also experience discomfort in my back on the right side that radiates out from the shoulder blade area after several minutes using the computer, using my iPhone, driving, etc. There has been no relief from the cortisone injection nor continued physical therapy 10/12/2021 and 10/19/2021. I requested an earlier follow-up appointment with Dr. and was seen on 10/15/2021 ordered an MRI and provided a prescription for Naproxen 500 mgs to replace the Motrin and Tylenol for pain. About one hour after taking one-half (250mgs) of the Naproxen prescribed dose I began experiencing dizziness and jitteriness in my hands that continued for several hours; I have not taken any more Naproxen and returned to Motrin and Tylenol for pain management.

They completed a hearing test and recommended seeing ENT as her hearing was completely gone for the left side. The daughter was able to get the patient to the ENT that day. ENT performed the hearing test twice and was not sure as to how she developed sudden hearing loss. ENT prescribed Prednisone regimen to reduce the inflammation that can cause the nerve to be blocked. After 2 weeks of steroids, still no improvement. The family pushed the ENT for an MRI and the MRI scan came to be clean. The daughter took the patient to another ENT for a second opinion. That ENT also says that the flu vaccine could have triggered an inflammatory response that has led to her hearing loss. The ENT will be performing a series of steroids injecting in the patient's ear in hopes to save the hearing.

With the second dose, it came and went a lot more than with the first dose. The first dose lasted a few days, but the 2nd dose was recurring.

The knee was drained, and blood was drawn to check for infection, gout, etc. I was told to take Tylenol after the knee was drained. The results for the blood work would be in in a week. I was told to see him in a week. I had seen an orthopedic doctor in July and was told after an X-ray, that I have arthritis in my knee. I was offered a cortisone shot but since I have followed natural medication for 25 years, I refused. I kept putting ice and taking Advil. I went back to see doctor who told me I did not have any disease or infections. My knee had to be drained again. I was currently walking with a cane. After the knee is drained, I do feel relief. The doctor then suggested the cortisone shot. At this point I was desperate for relief, so I took it. I was told to come back in a month. We would discuss prescription drugs he said but I was afraid of the side effects especially after being on natural medicines for so long. I had eczema in the past and also feared this condition being flared up. Since I had so much inflammation throughout my body, I experienced pain in my left shoulder as well.

Then at about 11:00 PM she started shaking uncontrollably like chills, which went on to body aches, nausea, headache and stomach ache.  She took her temp a couple hours later and it was 103.  She had a rough night and hardly slept.  The next morning she could not get up out of bed, and thought it was just a backache and was able to sit up on the side of her bed, and realized it was from her both kidneys.  Then it went on when she got up and was very weak and could hardy walk.  As she walked to the bathroom and got to the bathroom she had incontinence, and then for 2 1/2 days felt as if she had a UTI/burning and frequency or urination.  Every time she went to the bathroom she had incontinence again which she did not have an issue with that prior.   Then she felt kind of dizzy, lack of appetite, headache, joint pain.   She then felt much better on Monday, and it just kind of went away.  She did call a nurse hotline on Sunday and they kind of dismissed it, and they told her that she had COVID, and she informed them that she tested negative.  They told her if she got worse to go to the ER, but it never did, and was concerned about the reaction.  The kidney problems went on for about a day, and the UTI feeling went on for a couple of days.       On both occasions of getting her vaccines on the following Monday's it was like a switch went off and she was fine.  She gets her groceries on Friday nights and she was finishing her grocery shopping and standing in the middle of an isle and she could not move/walk.  Her legs were not able to move, and had to think about it, had  pain in her legs.  After a couple of minutes of standing in a daze and felt like they were lead.  It then stopped and then while pushing her groceries again it happened again in the parking lot, and then had to lift her legs one at a time into the car.  She then had to wait for a while in the car, was able to drive home, still had some symptoms, and was exhausted.  That reaction lasted for about 10 days on 3/14/21.  Then on Monday about noon she was fine.    The nurse hotline told her that she should see her doctor, that they felt that maybe it was MS and they dismissed that it was related to the vaccine.   The same thing happened after the 2nd vaccine again, exactly the same time, same place and exactly the same vaccine, also on Friday as well, lasting for 10 days also.    She went to her PCP and was tested in July and told her that she had no evidence of anything regarding MS.  Her legs also swelled and could hardly walk and was painful going up and down stairs which was about a week after the 2nd one.  She had x-rays and was diagnosed with severe arthritis in both knees, which she did not have arthritis prior to this.  The pain slowly went away by the end of September.  She is now almost normal other than very weak in her legs as she was almost unable to walk, had to use a cane all of the time and use objects to stabilize her to walk.    She is now afraid of falling as her knees would give out when they were swollen or what that was due from.     She is trying to figure out if she should have the booster.    She did have a really bad leg injury in February of 2020 when she fell on the ice and fell underneath her car, and landed on her knees and tore the muscles on her knees, and also hurt her shoulder.

About 2 weeks later the pain became so acute that I went to urgent care on the advise of the on-call doctor as he feared it was appendicitus or something equally awful.  They prescribed a broad spectrum antibiotic and large doses of Gas-X.  This calmed things down but I basically lived on yogurt and Gas-X for the next month.

I made it to the kitchen and only felt slightly faint, got another round of Tylenol, grabbed 4 bottles of water, and went back to my bed. I stayed in bed until 12:00 PM and was eventually able to get up without any chest pain or a headache.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the guillain barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, lower extremities weakness of and numbness in leg to be related to Influenza vaccine.  Additional information was reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in a male patient aged between 83 to 87-year old, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. The patient had medical history of coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft, coronary artery stents, and a dual-chamber pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome. No information on patient's family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date in 2017, shortly after receiving the vaccination, the patient had symptoms, laboratory, and electrophysiological features of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Thyroid function tests, hemoglobin A1c, serum protein electrophoresis, syphilis and Lyme titers were unremarkable. The patient had incomplete resolution of symptoms with a course of five plasma exchange treatments. One month after initial diagnosis and treatment, it was determined that the patient's condition had evolved to chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), for which the patient received ongoing plasmapheresis on an every two week basis, with symptom improvement but not normalization. [At the time of reporting, the patient was 87 year old and presented with acute worsening weakness and paresthesia of bilateral lower extremities. In March 2021, the patient had onset over twelve hours of significantly worse weakness and numbness in his legs, similar to his prior AIDP/GBS. It was noted that the patient had received a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine twenty-one days prior. His physical exam was notable for normal strength in the upper extremities, with diminished but present reflexes. Lower extremity exam revealed bilateral weakness in the hip, distal extremities, and feet. Ankle and knee reflexes were absent. Cerebrospinal fluid contained elevated protein. Electromyography revealed F-waves in the lower extremities. The patient was treated with a more intensive course of plasmapheresis consisting four treatments over ten days. His strength and sensation improved to baseline over this period]. The authors commented, ""We describe a patient with a history of AIDP/GBS, evolving into CIDP, who developed exacerbated CIDP (or AIDP) coinciding with receipt of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine."" The authors concluded, ""GBS/AIDP, or exacerbation of CIDP, is herein described to have coincided with the recent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. More studies are needed to determine whether our patient's clinical deterioration was merely coincident with receipt of vaccine or whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists.""",,,,,,,,,N,,,,"Test Date: 2017; Test Name: syphilis and Lyme titers; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:syphilis and Lyme titers were unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2017; Test Name: serum protein electrophoresis; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2017; Test Name: hemoglobin A1c; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2017; Test Name: Thyroid function tests; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:)",UNK,,,,"Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Coronary artery disease (requiring coronary artery bypass graft, coronary artery stents); Sick sinus syndrome (require dual-chamber pacemaker)",,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2021GS,2,10/20/2021,,,,

The patient had no recent illness, immobility or injury. It was reported that the patient was vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine administered just 10 days prior to symptom onset. She was transferred to the hospital Emergency Department for evaluation of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Venous Doppler of the left leg was performed in the emergency department which was found to have extensive occlusive DVT of the left superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins. The initial labs were significant for thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 15 x10E3/units per litre (U/L), International normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3 with low fibrinogen and high fibrin degradation products and elevated Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 704 U/L. It was reported that the patient was unable to treat with anticoagulation for DVT, hence an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed and she was hospitalized. Early the next morning the patient began experiencing loss of sensation in the right foot. An Arterial Doppler of the right leg was performed which was significant for high-grade occlusion of the right proximal superficial femoral artery. The patient was emergently taken to the cath lab where abdominal aortogram showed occlusions of bilateral iliac and superficial femoral arteries. Bilateral thrombectomy and stents were placed in both iliac arteries. Hematology was consulted for what appeared to be HITT (Heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia) reaction despite no heparin exposure and treatment with Bivalirudin was initiated. A peripheral blood smear noted thrombocytopenia with normocytic anemia, but no schistocytes were seen. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) panel was positive HIT antigen on Platelet factor 4 (PF4) and positive serotonin release assay (SRA), with an optical density (OD) of 0.519. There was no further clot formation occurred during the patient's hospitalization and platelet count improved after initiation of bivalirudin. The duration of hospitalization was unspecified.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       No concomitant medication information was mentioned by reporter  On 4mar2021 at 11 am, she had outpatient surgery to have her tonsils removed. The procedure was planned prior to vaccination due to persistent strep infections that totaled 6 between oct2020 to end of feb2021. After surgery in the hospital she noticed her right arm where she received her injection it was red. By the time she got home the red spot was beginning to look like a bullseye. The morning following her surgery she was unable to breathe, her husband called 911 and she was given IV epinephrine and prednisone. After one hour her vitals were normal. She was sent home with oral prednisone and Benadryl that she took for 5 days. Her doctor told her that while she was in surgery her blood pressure went really low, her heart rate skyrocketed and she went pale. She was given fentanyl and everything leveled out. She has not had this type of reaction with prior surgeries. Because her arm turned red after the surgery, the doctor was inclined to think there could have been an interaction with the vaccine and anaesthia. She was told to not get the second dose and was denied a booster. She says every couple of months her arm where she got the injection will itch for a minute and stops quickly. This mostly happens at night and she says she thinks it's when she gets warm because it has happened while she was at work stocking shelves and at home when she was leaning on the couch. She consents for safety to contact either via phone or email and has pictures.  This case concerns a female patient of unknown age with reported medical history of recurrent strep infections, who experienced the unexpected serious event of Dyspnoea. The event occurred 9 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine. The history of recurrent strep infections was reported to be the indication for pre-scheduled surgery to remove tonsils 8 days after receiving the vaccine and on the day before Dyspnoea occurred. The medications/anesthesia used for the surgery may have contributed to the event. The benefit-risk relationship of mRNA-1273 vaccine is not affected by this report.
