My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn't so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night.

They are as follows:   After Vaccine 1 (12/22/20):  I had the vaccine at around 1:30pm.  I only had arm-stiffness at first.  Approx. 24 hours after however (1:30pm the next day), I started having chills and feeling like I had a fever.  My entire body ached but I did not have a headache.  These side effects lasted through the night for approx. 14 hours.   The following day I woke up with a surge of energy and felt very much like I had been given a shot of adrenalin.  I?m not sure that I have ever felt as good.   After Vaccine 2 (01/11/21):  I had much more severe side effects after the second vaccine.  I had this vaccine at approx. 1:30 pm and within a couple of hours I started to feel a bit tired.  At approx. midnight that night, I started having body aches and a headache that woke me up.  I had chills and was oscillating between feeling very cold and feeling very hot.  Through the night I had to change my clothing several times due to sweating.  These symptoms lasted for the entire following day.  The second day after the vaccine I felt much better but still a little tired.    Of greatest concern is that I have a lingering pain deep within my left arm (the arm into which the shots were given).  Having a hard time extending my arm and doesn;t seems to be going away.  Sometimes it feels tingly and I sometimes have loss of grip and/or weakness in the entire arm.     Hope this helps you in compiling the side effects.

She brought the problem to the clinic supervisor?s attention when it seemed that the vaccinator assistant was opening up syringes and placing them in the same bin as the vaccinator?s pre-drawn syringes. Both contacted the CDC to get guidance on whether the client can be administered the vaccine as a Dose 1. The CDC was seeking further guidance on the issue. Both contacted the client that evening and explained that it was very likely that the client did not receive COVID-19 in the syringe. The client voiced understanding. It was determined by Dr. that vaccinator would contact the client once per day to check signs and symptoms to help determine if the client may have received the vaccine. It was believed that 24 or more hours of soreness at the site may lead one to believe that she did receive the vaccine. Vaccinator monitored the client for three days following the vaccine and found that the client had not signs or symptoms following the vaccine. 1/16/2021 CDC responded by saying that there is no guidance on this issue but that the client should receive the vaccine, as Dose 2, 28 days from the initial administration. The earliest date would be Saturday, February 6, 2021. Vaccinator contacted the client and explained the guidance. The client voiced understanding.

Considering all above mentioned, causal relationship for all events is assessed as possibly related (defaults to ''related'' in the safety database for reporting purposes).

It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use.

Looked at injection site and it looked normal, just a little red dot where the needle was directed to administer the vaccine. 7:00pm arm started to itch at injection site. Looked at site and it was a large red spot, warm to touch and had a large knot under the red injection site. Itching continued through the night isolated primarily to my upper extremities (arms, chest, face) region. Did not take Xyzal that night for fear of some type of interaction.  1/18/2021  6:00am awoke to more facial itching and took a shower. Noticed red splotches in the T zone of the face. More isolated around my eye lids, a section on my forehead, on the right side of the bridge of my nose, and my laugh lines on my face from the bottom of the nostrils down both sides of my mouth to my chin. Arm was sore, which I had expected and the spot was more red than the previous day, still warm to touch, and knot was still present.  7:30am Got to work and my took a 1/2 tablet of Xyzal since I can't function on a whole dose of that or Benadryl for a work day.  Itching subsided for about 4 hours.  1:00pm Took another 1/2 tablet of Xyzal. Lasted another 4 hours. 6:00pm Itching was back bad enough I took my normal nightly dose of 1 Xyzal table. It seemed to help until morning. Massaged knot on arm and tried to help lessen the soreness of the area. It was tender to touch, but not painful. 1/19/2021  5:30am Awoke to itching, spot still red, knot gone down compared to previous day. Took shower. Noticed that heat seems to bring out the redness in my face and makes the itching start again. Hot showers were not helping apparently.  7:00am Took 1/2 Xyzal, since itching was continuing. Lasted again for about 4 hours. 12:00pm Took 1/2 Xyzal and lasted an additional 4 hours. Thought the itching should be going away. 6:30pm Took normal dosage of Xyzal. Knot still present but not as prominent as previous days. Injection site still red.  1/20/2021 7:30am Went to local PCP for medical opinion and assistance.

I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult.

I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning.

My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt's room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state.

I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn't want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140), intramuscularly on the arm on 19Dec2020 11:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tachycardia and stroke from 2019 and diabetes mellitus diagnosed in summer of 2020 and ongoing. Family medical history included father had type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medication included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) for diabetes. The patient previously took regular flu shot and had body aches; it did not happen at the year of report but in years past she did have it. The patient took the COVID vaccine for precaution as she was a healthcare worker/paramedic and stated there was no prescriber. She received the vaccination at a health department facility, not a military facility. She had no previous immunizations and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date as COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Dec2020 and after nine days, she tested positive for COVID-19 on 30Dec2020 and had an inpatient hospital stay. She mentioned she was so happy that she did not have any symptoms for those days. She stated that she got the shot on the 19th and later that evening was when she started having symptoms. She tried to sleep and it woke her up, she felt sleepy, tired and experienced headache on 19Dec2020 20:00 to 21:00. On 28Dec2020 23:00, she had an increased cough. She initially had increased cough from wearing mask and was having post nasal drip, then she got wet cough and that was when she decided to get tested. She went back and forth on dates; stated she was confused with the dates because of being in the hospital, it had been a while and the dates were all meshing in together. Her specimen was collected and they did the test on 29Dec2020 then found out that she tested positive for COVID virus with a COVID test nasal swab on 30Dec2020 17:30. She mentioned she lost weight after she got COVID, had no sense of taste or smell on unspecified dates. She did not know if it was related to her thyroid but she started losing hair and her heart rate started increasing on Monday, so they took her off all her meds and said the COVID was doing crazy things to the body. She had to go on Carvedilol for the sinus tachycardia and had high blood pressure now. This was all new after she tested positive. She has had bouts of tachycardia before and did have a heart monitor as she had a stroke last year. So those have never been persistent or symptomatic. If she did have a high heart rate, it always went down. This one was symptomatic. She did fine the whole week after the shot, just had that little bit of sleepiness, was tired, and had a headache. The patient reported near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism on 08Jan2021 14:30 to 15:00, which required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 10Jan2021 (2 days). ER or physician's office was required. She never went to the ER for the vaccination, it was just for the near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism that she went and was then admitted to hospital. She just got out of the hospital the day before report (10Jan2021), was there for two days and was still recovering. She was supposed to receive her second vaccination on the day of report however her doctor did not know if she should get the second dose due to double antibodies. She did not ask if she still had the virus or it went away. She has not been to work in two weeks. Outcome of the events tested positive for COVID virus was not recovered; near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism was recovered with sequel; sleepy, tired and headache was recovering; while the remaining events was unknown.; Sender's Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

MI occurred after she finished clinic and she was not standing or doing anything, just sitting and she had chest pain. Her office was right next to the ER, so she received treatment within an hour and they were able to help her. She said that her hospital couldn't do a cardiac cath, so on 11Jan2021 they moved her to an hospital which was another treatment facility. When she had her MI they gave her acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and sublingual nitroglycerin. They tested her troponin and did an EKG which was abnormal on an unspecified date in Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 troponin was increased. When they treated her with nitroglycerin and Aspirin, two hours later her EKG was normal and her troponin came down overnight on 09Jan2021, which was when they said for sure that she had a heart attack. The patient said it was very scary to have a heart attack, but thankfully there was not a lot of damage done and she was able to get treatment quickly. She did not think the event was disabling since they did not see much damage to her heart muscle, it was a near miss kind of thing. She said it was life changing in that she will now be on medication forever, she will be on at least a baby Aspirin and probably something like a statin for the rest of her life. She was recovering, it was unknown what the lasting effects may be, she felt normal but tired from her hospital stay. Heart attack resolved on 08Jan2021.

Medical history included pneumonia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient received the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine and flu vaccine 21Sep2020 and on 22Sep2020, the patient has had a headache ever since. She wanted to know what she can do about the headache and is it safe to take the COVID-19 vaccine or wait until the headaches stops. She has had this headache since she got the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine and she has seen several doctors and had a MRI, she's had head scans and chest scans and everything they could think of, the doctors are stumped. Sometimes, she takes Advil and it will go away sometimes it will not go away. She was wondering if others have had that experience and what they have done about it. She does not have any dose information for the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine. She said it was the first dose of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine. She understands there are 2, you get the first one and later you get a second one. When asked for the indication, she stated that with the COVID virus many people her age was dying from pneumonia. She had pneumonia 40 years ago so she figured it would be a good idea to get the pneumonia vaccine first and then see if it is compatible with the COVID vaccine but she does not want to get the COVID vaccine if she still has a headache. She did not know what the name of the flu vaccine was. She just knew they gave the flu vaccine in the right arm and pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine in the left arm and she said they would not counteract each other, they were safe, so she took her word for it. Indication for flu vaccine: The doctor wanted her and her husband to get it, he is 88 and she is 80 so the doctor wanted them to get it to protect them through the winter. He wanted them to get it in Sep before the flu season hit. No further information provided. She says there is no other medicines medical conditions or lab results to add.
