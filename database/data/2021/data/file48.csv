My arm was swollen and the area of the injection site developed a pimple-like raised spot with a bright red area surrounding it.  The upper portion of the arm that had the injection, was mottled and sore.  The gland under the right arm was extremely painful and swollen (and is still tender to the touch today, April 12th). Chills  subsided at approximately 7am April 8th.I took Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 3000mg in a 24-hour period and drank fluids. The fever (102 degrees F) continued until approximately 3pm that afternoon. The evening of April at approximately 7pm, I had another fever, and took more Tylenol and then went to bed. I also had extreme fatigue beginning about two hours post injection.  April 7th, I slept a good part of the day.

Shivering became extreme (teeth actually chattering) by about 7pm, and whole body aches becoming profound. At about 7pm or so, I took 2 tylenol and got into a very hot bath. It took about 15 minutes for the chills/goosebumps and shivering to stop. But then I worried about pushing my temp up higher and protecting my brain, so I got out, took my temp, and it had shot up to nearly 102. So, I dried off and began shivering again, got into bed under 2 quilts and a wet cloth on my forehead and neck to cool my head. Finally the chills calmed down about a half hour later and I slept fitfully til I got out of bed about 6:30. But my heart was pounding hard all night, and in the morning  I still had a degree temp over my morning normal and the aching felt worse.

Prior to preventative medicine (Tahkzyro) availability, I treated each attack acutely with Firazry/Icatibant.   My swelling attacks were rare (no more than 6 times per year, and one injection stopped the attacks.    When Tahkzyro was approved as a prevention (every two week injection), in Oct. 2018, I began to administer this medicine 2x per month.   This eliminated ALL attacks to my extremities, but not to my abdominal area.   Those attacks were reduced to 4/yr, with a recurrence of attack within a day of first attack.  Firazry/icatibant had to be injected again (after six hours) and within a day, the attack would stop.  Tracking my triggers, I found consistency in the following (all three situations would have to be present).   1. Near my menstruation cycle. 2. Some viral-like symptom (scratchy throat/allergy, virus/illness). 3. Some stressor (activity, emotional, or weather-related).   None of these things, alone, set off an attack.  They have to occur around the same time.  My Johnson and Johnson vaccine was administered on March 18.   My period was due on April 3.  My period is 95% on time, always.  Depending on the timeframe for PMS/horomones, I would say that the injection was proceeded by my body entering into this phase.   On Mary 21, I experience my first abdominal attack in 6-8 months.  I injected Icatibant and after 6 hours, had to inject again due to a recurring attack.  I ordered a refill on my injections.   On April 2, I travelled to for vacation.  On April 4, I experienced the first of several abdominal attacks.  I ran out of medicine and had to have a new order shipped to my hotel (this had never happened before).   My menstruation was also late.  By April 9, my menstruation arrived, with a flow extremely higher than I recalled ever having in my adult life.   My abdominal attacks also ceased by that point.  I believe that having received this vaccine (which I am told has some form of the virus), during my PMS stage, along with over exerting myself with activities, created the three situations that occur to create a very painful, debilitating, abdominal attack.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/18/2021,03/21/2021,3,,OTH,,Tahkzyro,none,Hereditary Angioedeme,,,2,04/12/2021,,,,None

Those symptoms continued for 7 weeks, but the inflammation decreased in the muscles/joints diminished.   7 weeks after receiving the vaccine because of the acute inflammation and anxiety she ended up 3 nights and days with no sleep.  She went to the UC again and they gave her something for that.  She is still having heart arrhythmias as her heart is inflamed.  Then starting the 1st week in April she started getting sick.  The arrhythmias increased to palpitations to PVC's that began to increase.  She became dizzy, light headed at times, the nausea started, the palpitations were painful and then went to see a cardiologist.  He is trying to get medications to stop the palpitations.  So far they are waiting for the medication to take effect.  She has been down for 5 days, she is weak, dizzy when she is up.  Her BP and pulse are stable, EKG is normal.  She is also having what she is calling surges and/or storms, acute anxiety storms that rush through her body which makes her body feel like fire rushing through her body, acute panic.  It causes her to have to lie down and curl up, fatigue, dizziness and nausea to go with that.  It does subside slowly, but takes about 2 hours.  She has ongoing symptoms that are increasing in severity and are trying to treat the symptoms, but so far just waiting for things to work    She has never been sick, never had anxiety issues.

She went back to work last week and was at work the whole week. She was told she does have leave time and that it did not cover the absence of work. She now needs new leave time forms completed.  Currently she is in a lot of pain. She has her endocrine appointment on March 15th. The pain is getting worse. The cold is really hard on her. She is barely able to move her right arm at the end of the day, and that is the arm where she had the COVID shot. She is having a lot more weakness.

1198527,04/12/2021,MO,58.0,58,,F,,"2 Events: Evening following 2nd injection, I went from having no dental issues to having severe tooth pain on lower left jaw, roughly 4-5 teeth in from back molar.  Swelling began within hours accompanied by intense pain and sensitivity.  By that Sunday evening, swelling had extended up to left eye, over to bottom of ear, and down neck to baseline and half way to center jaw line.  Bruising present.  Throbbing was constant.  Made emergency dental appointment for Monday, but by that Sunday night, I could not stand it any longer and was afraid the swelling would extend to my throat.  Went to ER, who diagnosed an abcess under the tooth root.  Perscribed pain pills and antibiotics.  Saw dentist Monday, who scheduled me for an emergency root canal on Tuesday.  Got root canal on a tooth I never had problems with before, although there certainly could have been an issue brewing but not yet pronounced.  Anyway, he also drained what he called an unbelievable amount of infection fluid (pus) after making an incision in my gum line and basically squeezing my face to get as much out as he could.  Said he never saw anything like it.  And for me to go from 0 to that in a matter of days was incredible.  I thought perhaps it was an immune response?  At the same time that I was experiencing the dental issue, I started to develop a strong dry cough.  I have a light former smokers cough, and have had pneumonia many times, but this cough was different.  Every day it has gotten strongly, but is very much intermittent.  I now go into fits of coughing that last one to two minutes and so strong and to the point where I have either fractured my rib directly beneath my right breast, or something else is going on.  These fits can last minutes, but never result in expulsion of phlegm.  The coughing fits also occur if I take a deeper breath, walk too far, laugh, or talk too long.  Very strange.  I am very fatigued and have been since the onset of the dental issue reported above.    While the dental issue is gone since the absess was drained, the cough is still present, and wakes me up every single night too with coughing fits.  The cough has loosened up a bit.  I would go to the doctor, but I am in the middle of a move from MO to AZ, and just arrived in AZ after a 3 day drive.  So, first off, I am reporting this issue.  And next, I will seek a new doctor in Arizona if this cough continues.",,,,,,,,,N,03/25/2021,03/26/2021,1,Root canal 3/30 -  just xrays that showed the infection under the root,UNK,,Synthroid B12 sublingual Gabapentin Duloxetine Losartan Hydochlorothiazide Buproprion XL,None,Bronchitis/Pre-COPD High Blood Pressure and Chlorestoral Overweight Depression,,,2,04/12/2021,,Y,Y,None

At 0030 (or 30 minutes past midnight) I was awoken to the sudden shock of feeling very cold. My temperature was 91, within 15 minutes I spiked to 100 degrees, and then 15 minutes later I was at 102. I was shivering but felt like I was on fire. I had intense pain throughout my entire body. Internally and topically (skin) my entire body felt like it was on fire -- a burning sensation. Clothes -- even a soft hoodie -- felt like a steel wool scrubber was brushing against my skin and my skin was very hot to touch. I continued to feel nauseous.  After 90 minutes of this, I was able to take acetaminophen (2 x 500 mg). After another 90 minutes, my temperature dipped to 99 and the horrible pain mostly subsided.   From 0530 to 1830, in three-hour increments, my temperature continued to spike and fall between 99-101 degrees and the pain came in the same waves. Nausea continued. So, I continued an acetaminophen regimen throughout the day to help with the symptoms and took a few tums to help too.  After 1830, I felt very weak and tired. My temperature stabilized at normal. Nausea continued.   On Saturday, April 10, I was mostly just tired and had minor body aches/soreness. My shoulder bruised where I was vaccinated. Food did not sit well and my stomach was quick to turn.   Sunday, April 11, mostly back to normal. Although, still fatigued. No major side effects or symptoms.

Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications.

The pain lasted until a little after 5 am.   On the day after my injection, I started to get a fever around noon.  I accidentally broke my thermometer while washing it.  My last reading (around 3 PM) was 100 degrees.  I definitely felt feverish throughout the rest of the day and into the evening.  My muscles throughout my body also felt tired/sore.  My husband said that my forehead was really warm.  Later in the evening (around 7 PM), my legs began to have intense pain.  The muscular pain was centralized behind both thighs and calves.  I put a heated massage pillow against the areas to try to relieve the pain.  It helped for small intervals, but did not cure it.  I also used a heating pad and Tylenol to try to fight the pain.  I also tried to drink lots of water.   At 10:30 PM, the pain was unbearably intense, causing me to have a panic attack (which of course made things worse).  After another Tylenol and session with the heating pad, I was finally able to fall asleep (over an hour later).  I woke up around 3:00 AM drenched in sweat from breaking my fever.   Since breaking my fever, I have had almost no further adverse symptoms (besides my muscles feeling ""slightly"" sore).

I began having chills and pulled several blankets over me about an hour later I took my temperature again and it was 103. I became concerned and called my doctors office.

Reviewed patient's previous urgent care notes as well as immunization record.  Her vital signs are stable in the urgent care today and exam is largely benign.  Given her history and current complaints did obtain a chest x-ray which appears negative, formal interpretation was pending at time of discharge.  She was provided Zofran in the urgent care today which she did state helps with the nausea.  Discussed with patient that I do feel that COVID-19 testing should be collected as at the time of her symptoms and given her continued symptoms she has not had full immunity from the vaccination and this could still be a COVID-19 infection.  She is in agreeance and COVID testing is pending.  Prescribed refill of her Zofran as well as Tessalon for cough relief and advised continued symptomatic measures and close follow-up with PCP for any persistent symptoms.  She was provided a work note given her symptoms and COVID-19 testing she was provided the standard COVID-19 work letter.

After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea.

I slept much of the afternoon after I got the shot, because it was hard for me to get out that early in the day, but when I woke up in the evening, I was extremely sick.  I was extremely nauseated, on the verge of throwing up for a very long time, and could not even brush my teeth.  I also had a really bad headache. Muscle and joint pain all over.  I think I may have had a fever but I couldn't put the thermometer in my mouth. This morning, the day after the vaccine, the nausea is mostly gone, but not totally gone. My body pains are horrible, and my arm pain at the site is the worst. My forehead feels warm but I'm not about to risk taking my temp because I don't want to throw up.  fyi, I also got very sick when I got the Shingrix vaccine a couple of years ago.  I was worse with the first shot, totally out of commission for almost a full week, but still pretty sick with the second shot.

I tend to react badly to lots of meds and procedures, but this is the worst. When I woke up during the nite I wanted to be dead because the pain and nausea were so horrible.

It was mild enough that I assumed I had just slept in the wrong position.  Over the course of the next several nights, the numbness and pins and needles sensation grew progressively worse. I was waking up several times throughout the night as a result and the numbness and tingling has spread to all four limbs (hips to toes, shoulders to fingers). The night of April 1st, the feeling had grown severe enough that I had trouble sleeping and was growing very worried about the symptoms. I didn?t have any symptoms during the day though, and that night the symptoms mostly went away.

I had a headache which is rare for me and tried to drink extra water, but by 5pmish came I took a handful of tylenol since I had an after work walk to go on with a girlfriend. After the walk I came home and had a desire to lay down and go to sleep. my leg was starting to go from tingle to burn. i decided that i needed to eat some dinner. after dinner i was struggling with breathing while sitting in the recliner chair watching TV, so I told my other half I needed to lay down, this was around 7pm. Then it was just a crazy leg burn from the back of my knee into my foot. I was describing it as if I someone pour gasoline on me and lite the match and I was burning alive. I took a muscle relaxer and forced myself to sleep.   The day after the J&J shot. i had chills and was so cold that mid day when I had breaks during my work from home, i climbed in bed with a heating pad to warm up. the shot also left a scare on my arm, which i found odd since i give myself six injections a week for my bone disease.

I went to find a nurse nearby who walked me to an area to sit/rest so that she could monitor me.

But this time, I just felt the blood just pouring into my mouth. So I was scared and  asked my wife called 911. After 2-3 hours, the bleeding stopped and I back home. To be cautious, I made an appointment with family doctor on next day (24th). But the bleeding happened again in the evening ( cannot remember exactly, but around 9pm). This time I just used the clipper for my nose and it took another 2 hours for the bleeding to stop. I had a very rough night while sitting on bed and had very little sleep. The next morning (24th), the bleeding come back after I used the restroom. The same feeling as the two bleeding before. I rushed to doctor's office even not my appointment yet. The family doctor said he cannot do anything since he cannot observe the place of blooding and he does not have instrument needed. I was referred to a specialist. And luckily I had the same day appointment. We rushed there and after roughly several hours waiting, I was the specialist and finally he did the treatment. Since then, my nose is ok and no serious bleeding again.  After I saw the side effects of JJ vaccine, I think it is better for me to report you what happened. I strongly suspect that my serious bleeding was caused by the drop of platelet which was side effect of the vaccine. I will have one blood work today.

I had been feeling nauseous for a few hours and then my eyes started bouncing back and forth uncontrollably. I was unable to see correctly or move from my chair. Once my eyes stopped moving my vision became tunnel vision and everything around it became foggy. I felt weak and dizzy. I started getting a headache. I didn't think I could even call out for help as I was unsure my voice would work. Once it all calmed down I figured it must be part of a migraine, even though nothing this extreme had ever happened before. I moved to my bed as I was suddenly completely exhausted, and immediately fell asleep for almost 3 hours. Once I got up I was still very groggy and had to force myself my. I stayed up for about 3 hours and went back to bed for the night. The next morning I woke and was feeling better so I figured it must have been a migraine. However a few hours later the same problems started back up again. I was having a hard time seeing my computer screen, I had a foggy head and was finding it hard to concentrate and do work. My headache started again and my vision started as foggy and became tunnel vision again. This time my eyes did not bounce, but my lips started tingling. This lasted for about 1 minute. This time with everything I was making sure to take a mental note of everything going on because I was scared I was going to have to call 911. Because I was home alone I opened my phone to dial if it got any worse. The event backed off enough that I took myself to the ER. By the time I was in the waiting room my head felt like a balloon and my whole body just felt ""off."" I can't explain how it felt, it just didn't feel normal. My headache never got overly severe like it does with a migraine, but I was worried about a stroke. The ER did a CT scan and did rule out a stroke, but was unsure of what it exactly what it was, but guessed it was an abnormal migraine attack and told me to follow up with my PCM in a couple of days and to keep my appointment with my neurologist on April 15th.

Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104+ fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103+ fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it...

Had minimal side effects, that included a weird headache (I have migraines and this was unlike any migraine I ever had), it was like a halo above my ears and around the crown of my head.  I also had a sore arm.  No other issues.  On January 11th I got my second dose.  Again sore arm, nothing terrible.  This time I was prepared and over hydrated to prevent the headaches.  On day 2 after my shot I noticed both my shoulders starting to hurt and complained to my best friend I felt like a bus ran me over.  I said maybe it?s the shot but we shuffled it off to I slept funny.  2 weeks went by, same thing still going on; except some days my shoulders hurt so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.  About 4 weeks post injection my knees also started to hurt.  I visit my chiropractor every 2-3 weeks regularly since having my daughter 12 years ago because my pelvis rotates out of place; her and I discussed what was going on and she said she had a couple other patients complain of similar things and it typically gets better after 6 weeks.  So I give it a few more days, decide to message my family care doctor just to let her know what?s going on.  She checks me for Rheumatoid Arthritis- that?s negative.  Checked my CRP-  which were elevated to basically say I was having an inflammatory response.  (I knew all these things already lol you don?t just wake up at 38 with RA with no family history but whatever).  Another week went by and I am at work and can?t stand up to walk- like crying in pain my knees and arms hurt so bad.  One of the anesthesiologist gives me a Decadron injection.  An hour later it was like magic, I actually had relief.  Unfortunately less than 48 hrs later the pain came back.  I went to my family doctor and had a conversation about all of this.  They put me on a tapering dose of Prednisone for 10 days- because unfortunately the max dose for Decadron is 6 days we decided to do Prednisone so I could have more days.  I started with 100 mg a day of Prednisone and tapered it down for 10 days.  I finally felt back to normal and it was amazing!!  Then 5 days after the last dose of Prednisone the pain came back yet again in my knees.  It hasn?t come back as bad in my shoulders but it?s definitely worse in my knees.
