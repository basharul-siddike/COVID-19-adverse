A blister/skin tag developed under my breast area which is still there today. I took a zyrtec  which caused some of the smaller red spots to disappear but the large red spot on my arm remained.  When I used deodorant I developed a rash under both arms so I reached out to my Dermatologist who prescibed a steroid cream and  advised I take 2 doses of the zyrtec.  That didnt help so I was now advised take a zytec/pepid bid and 2benedryl at night.  I to date still have to bath with oatmeal and baking soda because the itching gets so bad at times.

It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn't. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy.

On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said ""I need to go to the ER, don't go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you"". I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit.

The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few ""bump"" near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of ""about 100."" Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient's creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.

The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.    When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,03/23/2021,,,,

The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, facility has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.

The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the MOB has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.

The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.

1127356,03/23/2021,,55.0,55,,F,,"Background: pharmacy received 49 vials of Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot number EN6199) on 5 March 2021 and stored them in the pharmacy refrigerator.   The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the medical office has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date. This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses. On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.

1127368,03/23/2021,,72.0,72,,M,,"Background: Hesperia pharmacy received 49 vials of Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot number EN6199) on 5 March 2021 and stored them in the pharmacy refrigerator.   The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the Hesperia MOB has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.    When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,03/23/2021,,,,

1127381,03/23/2021,,71.0,71,,M,,"Background: pharmacy received 49 vials of Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot number EN6199) on 5 March 2021 and stored them in the pharmacy refrigerator.   The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the facility has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date. This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.    When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,03/23/2021,,,,

The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the Pharmacy MOB has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.

I get to work and I'm open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn't palpate and feel it but just couldn't access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn't think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn't work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn't talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe.

They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That's it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn't have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn't want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm.

Ultimate cause still not determined or successfully treated; pain continues treated by opoids, gabapentin, anti-nausea medication.  Patient has not been able to work since March 4th, 2021 (currently March 23rd, 2021).  Details: The day after the first vaccination, abdominal pain similar to that the patient had previously experienced, but which had not presented severely for around a two years, recurred quite severely for 4-5 days.  Missed 2 days of work. Pain reduced enough to resume work after 4-5 days.  The day after the second vaccine dosage (2 Feb 2021), the abdominal pain worsened again, becoming more severe and more prolonged than after the first dosage. Missed four days of work (not consecutive).  Pain worsened. 12 March 2021 visited PCP, who recommended immediate ER/hospital admittance.  ER could not any definite cause of pain (though 8cm fibroid present, thought to be causing lower abdominal pain but not upper abdominal) and released patient.  Abdominal pain became somewhat better but still continued.  March 6th, abdominal pain greatly increased, leading to ER visit and hospital admittance March 6th-March 9th, 2021.  CT scan 6 March 2021.  Relevant results:  Bowel: Multiple dilated loops of distal small bowel with fecalization of small bowel contents and a slow transition to normal caliber at the terminal ileum. The appendix is not visualized. The stomach is unremarkable. The colon is not dilated.   Mesentery/Peritoneum: Small indeterminate density fluid adjacent to dilated loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant.   Nodes: Scattered small abdominal nodes, none meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.   Pelvis: Large uterine leiomyoma.  Uterine fibroid identified as probably source of pelvic and lower abdominal pain.  Mid and upper abdominal pain thought not to be related, however, and may be related to dilated loops of distal small bowel and adjacent fluid.  Pain treated with opoids, gabapentin, anti-nausea drugs, patient released 9 March 2021.  Abdominal pain continues, partially controlled with pain medications.  Lower pelvic pain has not recurred (birth control pills started at end of hospital visit).  Patient has been been able to work since March 4th (currently March 23rd, 2021).

The patient stated that the pain was not limited to her hands but was in the whole body and was unable to use her hands. The patient described it as zombie symptoms since it was difficult to walk and stated that the side effects did not start immediately after the injection but about a week after the vaccination.  Patient reports that around a week after getting the vaccine she had a knee shot injection for pain and that was when the symptoms got worse.  Less than a month after receiving Shingrix, the patient reported going to the emergency room on 1st January 2021 for the symptoms as numbness in my hands, neck, knees, upper arm, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, extreme pain. She could hear her joints move and crackling and stated that the pain was very chronic.  The patient stated she was provided Oxycontin at the emergency room. The patient reported that less than 4 months after receiving Shingrix, her both hands were swollen, and it had affected both sides of the body and also reported urinary incontinence, stated her incontinence got worst after the vaccine and had no feeling at all. The patient reported she had magnetic resonance imaging and visits to neurologist, chiropractor and labs.  The patient reported normally she did not get flu shots or any vaccines.

My husband and I left the site and stopped to do some shopping about 5 miles down the road from the site.  I was driving.  When I got out of the car, I immediately noticed that I was unsteady, I thought I was just being clumsy until I walked around my car to help my husband ( I am his caretaker) out of the car but I was collapsing and needed to steady myself against the car and get my way back to the car because of intense dizziness.  When I got back into the car, I asked him if he could make it to the restaurant and get me some water.  He did and I drank a bottle of water.  At this time I felt like I was going to have the runs and throw up at the same time so I drove through the parking lot and used the bathroom at the restaurant.   I was a little dizzy but it was not as intense as when I first got out of the car.  I was able to walk to the bathroom and back out without any difficulty.  I did have the runs but the feeling of throwing up passed.  We got back into the car and waited until I felt safe to drive.  After another 15 minutes I drove home.  During the drive I felt sick again and had to stop in a parking lot and throw up.  After throwing up, I felt fine and drove the rest of the way home.  I was able to make it into the condo with no problem and take a shower.  I felt steady and no longer sick.  I went to bed for a couple hours and then got up and ate some food which I kept down. During the rest of the day, I took it easy.  Today I feel fine.  No headache.  I will write if I  have any other problems.  I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.?

On an unspecified date, the patient reported having these feelings in both arms, more so a tingly feeling in the right side of the face, and hypersensitivity in the face. She had a pain that goes from the right side of the face to the back of the brain. Her blood pressure went up. She also had a lot of liquid, and felt dehydrated almost felt like her right side was going to drool. She wanted to know if this could be palsy or a nerve condition. She stated she's concerned about getting second dose because she was still having these feelings. The patient wanted to know if it would be safe to use the EpiPen her Doctor prescribed to her, since her blood pressure went up high, instead of going down, like it usually would happen in the severe cases of allergic reactions; for that and the tingly face, the doctor recommended that she receive the second dose in the hospital. She stated she received her first dose at a convention center and wanted to know if Pfizer could provide her with a letter saying she would need to receive her second dose in a hospital. She was supposed to get the second vaccine on Thursday (unspecified date). She was concerned because of a reaction she immediately had and has had since that timeframe. She felt a little hot prior to the COVID Vaccine. After she got the COVID Vaccine, she felt hot. She was sitting there waiting and felt a little hot on her forehead. She thought she had a little sweat. She also thought she was being crazy because she was hot before she got to the COVID vaccine location. Twenty-nine minutes in she started feeling extreme heat on her face. She was burning and tingling. She felt she was having a lot of congestion. She saw her face turned very red. She had to use a lot of ice because it felt like she was on fire. She was there for two hours being monitored. Her blood pressure was 153/92 when it normally was 100/70. Her blood pressure was checked three times and the lowest was 142/90. She stated she is not allergic to Benadryl, but when she was a little kid she had a side effect so she doesn't use Benadryl. She was given Pepcid immediately after COVID Vaccine. She had red flushness on her chest. She had a tingling feeling under her throat. Her face swelled up a little bit, but enough where she could feel it. She stated she had neck pain prior to the COVID vaccine. Fifteen minutes after the COVID vaccine, she felt pain rise from the right side of her neck to her head. She also felt numbness across her face. It didn't go away. After two and a half hours at the COVID vaccine facility, she was told to go home, and someone would call to check on her. She felt a slight itchiness on the right side of her face. Her face looked very red, specifically her cheeks and forehead. She was so fatigued, she felt like she was drugged. She took Claritin. She couldn't fall asleep. She has extreme GERD and would wake up with an extreme racing heartbeat. She also had this happen prior to the COVID vaccine. She stated she takes Omeprazole, basically the prescription version of Prilosec. She stated her GERD is inflammation-based and the COVID vaccine must have triggered the GERD. Eight hours after the COVID vaccine, she fell asleep for five minutes, woke up, looked in the mirror and there was a big, red rash area on the whole right eye area on the right side of her face above her eye, but not to the top of her forehead. She hasn't been diagnosed with the cause of what is going on with her right eye. She does have right eye proptosis prior to vaccine so maybe the whole right side of her face was targeted because she has immune issues on that side prior to vaccine. On the next four days, she got zero sleep and had a hard time sleeping. She went to her primary doctor on Monday (unspecified date) and her blood pressure was 140-something over 80-90. Five days after the COVID vaccine, her blood pressure returned back to normal. This whole time she was taking Claritin. She could feel tingling feeling through her arm. She almost feels like she had been shocked or electrocuted. She had that continually feeling in her face and arm since the COVID vaccine. She did see an allergist who stated caller should have been given an EpiPen immediately. She has never used and EpiPen before. She saw the allergist seven to eight days later. The allergist took blood to see if there was still a histamine response, but her results were normal. She was still feeling those weird feelings of being electrocuted or shocked. The right side of her face is hypersensitive. It comes and goes. She did see her endocrinologist who stated maybe it's a neurological response to the COVID vaccine. She stated the doctor had seen what happened to her before, but it didn't last long. This doctor saw the face would go away after thirty minutes and reporting the ones that come back for the second time, their high blood pressures lasted for twenty-four hours. Her high blood pressure lasted for 5 days. The past couple of days her blood pressure has been very low and then high. It is all over the place, which is not normal for her.

He had delirium, hallucinations, and constantly did not know where he was due to great confusion. After 8 days in the hospital, he had to go to rehab for 8 days to learn how to walk all over again. The hospital, after testing him over and over again, decided that the vaccine was the cause of his symptoms. His mental symptoms took 5 days to clear.  He took his second shot on 6 Mar 2021, and this time he  was admitted to the ICU due to his symptoms returning 10 fold from the first time he experienced it. Within 4 hours after he took the vaccine, he started saying crazy stuff that doesn't make sense, then slept a lot and had severe dreams and  hallucinations. She also mentions that her father had very violent behavior and it was very out of  character for him.

She discloses the Hospital will not do a MRI for her father since the two CT scans came back clear. She also mentions that he is still reaching for  things and eating things that are not there, she mentions he is very weak and her biggest worry is that this time, he won't come back to her mentally like he did the first time due to the severity of the symptoms. She believes that because he had the disease for so long, his body has built antibodies to it and he probably was not a good candidate to receive the vaccine.

The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering.

She got out of bed and started walking, grabbed her stuff to shower and started feeling that her headache was building up more than it had all morning so far. She thought maybe it was just because she had just physically gotten up and started walking. She got into the shower, and for about 2-3 minutes into getting into the shower, she remembered she had started putting shampoo into her hands; grabbing the shampoo bottle; but she suddenly got so nauseous and the headache that came on was extreme. She did not have a lot of time to react. She thought she would throw up in the shower, she had no time to get out of the shower to the toilet to throw up; she suddenly felt dizzy, passed out in the shower and fell to her left side on the floor.

Then she lost all the strength in her arms and legs.

On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and inability to eat for two days. The patient reportedly received the second dose of BNT162B2 four days prior to coming to the emergency room (ER). In the ER, the patient reported severe asthenia, mild upper abdominal pain and dysphagia, all as of an unspecified date. The patient underwent a CTA in the ER, on Feb2021, which showed no acute pulmonary embolism, or no ground glass infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 21Feb2021 at 17:51 for management of worsening shortness of breath. Due to the patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema and obesity, hypoventilation (as of an unspecified date in Feb2021) was further complicated by obstructive sleep apnea, thus, the patient was admitted to ""MedSurg"". The patient did not present with COVID-19 or COPD. The BMP was 226 at the time of admission. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen and additionally started on CPAP at night. She was seen by a pulmonologist who recommended Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR). Pulmonology also recommended to work-up any underlying unaddressed coronary artery disease contributing to the patient's shortness of breath. The patient underwent an echocardiogram on Feb2021 with regadenoson (LEXISCAN) for her shortness of breath which was within normal limits. As the patient additionally reported dysphagia at the time of admission, she was evaluated by a speech and swallow evaluation specialist as well as a gastroenterologist. A GI swallow series was recommended which the patient underwent on Feb2021 and was found to have no active signs of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. The patient additionally underwent a physical exam on 24Feb2021 at 08:00 with the following results. Vital signs: Temp: 98.2, Pulse: 69, Resp: 17, B/P (MAP): 98/62 (74), Pulse Ox: 96, O2 Delivery: Nasal cannula, O2 flow rate:2.00.

Literature citation: Contact transmission of vaccinia to an infant diagnosed by viral culture and metagenomic sequencing. Open Forum Infect Dis. 2020.   A 10-month-old female infant who had ""contact transmission of vaccinia; sores on the baby's hands and mouth were a result of autoinoculation"" (PT: Vaccinia virus infection) following Vaccinia transmission was suspected with ACAM2000 (smallpox vaccine, live). It was reported that an ""occult transmission from a recent vaccine to the mother, and then from mother to child, to be the most likely etiology of the child's skin lesions in this case"" (PT: Secondary transmission).    Case report: It was reported that she was presented to a hospital for evaluation of fever and new skin lesions. On exam, the diaper area had 10 circular to irregularly shaped ulcers, 1-2.5 cm in size, with undermined borders, all painful to touch. The parents reported ""blisters"" that developed 4-5 days prior and ulcerated in the following days. Scattered red macules were noted in perioral and acral locations.   The patient had received no medical care before this illness, and she was behind in her vaccines, not travel and no animal exposure or recent changes in topical hygiene products. The patient improved with supportive care. Vaccinia immune globulin and antivirals with anti-vaccinia activity were considered for treatment of the skin lesions but ultimately were not administered.   The patient's mother had a history of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and reported a recent illness and flare of her skin disease. On exam, she had numerous circular collarettes of scale over her forearms and arms from a vesicular eruption that began the week prior but was resolving without intervention. The patient's father, an active-duty military member, had a 1-cm vesicular, crusted plaque above his right upper lip, which he attributed to a cold sore. Neither parent, nor other close contacts, had received recent live-virus vaccinations.    At the time of this report, the child's parents had not undergone testing for vaccinia exposure, and a follow-up epidemiologic investigation failed to identify another potential source of exposure. As neither parent had been recently vaccinated, the author considered occult transmission from a recent vaccinee to the mother, and then from mother to child, to be the most likely etiology of the child's skin lesions in this case. Given the distribution of the child's lesions, it was suspected that transmission occurred during diaper care and that the sores on the baby's hands and mouth were a result of autoinoculation.   The author commented that ACAM2000 contains replication-competent virus that can be shed from the intradermal vaccination site for up to 3 weeks, and this vaccine was in use during the time this patient developed infection. As many military members in the father's workplace receive ACAM2000 vaccine, it was theoretically possible that contact transmission resulted in unrecognized secondary vaccinia infection in the father, with or without tertiary infection in the mother, subsequently followed by infection in this infant. Secondary transmission to the child through fomites in the household is also possible, although less likely based on the location of the lesions and given a lack of identifiable family contact with known recent vaccinees.   Based on the available information in the article, 3 individual case safety reports 21000032LT (infant) 21000033LT (mother) and 21000034LT (father) were created and cross linked in the database.  Company Comment: The company agrees with the author that there was a secondary and tertiary transmission from the mother to the baby.

This case refers to a male patient, an active-duty military member who had secondary vaccine infection from an unknown source, although presumable by contact from other military members recently vaccinated with ACAM2000 vaccine (PTs: Vaccinia virus infection and Secondary transmission). The patient developed a 1-cm vesicular, crusted plaque above his right upper lip, which he attributed to a cold sore. He had not received any recent live-virus vaccinations. At the time of this report, he had not undergone testing for vaccinia exposure, and a follow-up epidemiologic investigation failed to identify another potential source of exposure. The author deducted that the JYNNEOS vaccine was not available at the time of these events and therefore, ACAM2000 vaccine was in use during the time this patient developed infection. As many military members in the father's workplace receive ACAM2000 vaccine. Then, it was also possible a secondary vaccinia infection in the father to the mother and the infant.

1130355,03/24/2021,,90.0,90,,F,,"Background: pharmacy received 49 vials of Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot number EN6199) on 5 March 2021 and stored them in the pharmacy refrigerator.   The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the MOB has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.    When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,03/24/2021,,,,

I have searched the agency website and see where a second dose is not recommended for anyone that has had a severe or non-severe allergic reaction to the first dose. What I had was not severe, but I am unclear if it was enough to preclude me from receiving a second dose.

Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved).

Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake.

The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the pharmacy has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.    When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,03/24/2021,,,,

1130421,03/24/2021,,32.0,32,,F,,"Background: Hesperia pharmacy received 49 vials of Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot number EN6199) on 5 March 2021 and stored them in the pharmacy refrigerator.   The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, the Hesperia MOB has always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.    When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,03/24/2021,,,,

Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.

Teleneurology were consulted and repeat MRI/MRA brain were recommended w/ thinner slicing and coronal DWI to better visualize a possible small stroke; these could not be accomplished until 03/22 due to increasing delirium and need for Anesthesia involvement.  No evidence of acute process by local Radiology.  Images also reviewed by Neurology; also read no acute process.

It is noted from VAERS data that there are more than 800 reports of encephalitis potential linked to COVID vaccination.  Patient denies history of VZV or HSV.  No recent travel.  No pets at home.  Discussed with patient's daughter; she notes patient was previously alert, conversant, and independent.  She is significantly changed, though appears somewhat better every day.  She reports no family members have taken ill recently.  Started acyclovir 10mg/kg q8h IV 03/23.  Discussed with ID, who consulted 03/24. They note, from an ID perspective, presentation does not fit very well with an aseptic meningoencephalitis, which is what CNS fluid analysis might point to. They noted it would be reasonable to discuss w/ Teleneurology any other potential non-infectious causes which might explain her clinical presentation plus mild lymphocytic predominant CSF abnormalities.  Given negative HSV1/2 CSF PCR, they recommended discontinuation of acyclovir, d/c'd 03/24.  Updated hospital.  They note technically this appears to be an aseptic meningitis by lab findings; a viral or autoimmune encephalitis remain in the differential.  It is noted that the patient does have a positive serum ANA screen at 1:80, speckled pattern.  They recommend adding oligoclonal band profile to CSF, as the presence of CSF banding would suggest intrathecal antibody synthesis and point toward autoimmune etiology.  They also recommend serum autoimmune encephalitis panel (ARUP test code 2013601; ordered), SPEP, as well as CSF encephalitis panel if possible; unfortunately, per lab, there is no CSF remaining for study.  EEG also recommended, as this could elucidate features suggestive of viral meningitis.  EEG ordered.  TeleNeuro Dr requests update through TeleNeuro portal of any significant findings.

He could not confirm whether or not the stools might be a little darker than usual for him and he also had 1 out of 3 stool occult blood test that were positive.  He has chronic anemia with the hemoglobin slightly lower than his baseline, so GI was consulted and an EGD was performed.  He does have Barrett's esophagus and GI discussed with him how he will need follow-up EGDs, and I reminded him of that as well.  Warning signs and alarm symptoms were discussed.  He was placed back on his Eliquis however he will not be taking the Effient medication.  This was based on recommendation from cardiology.  He will have lab work done and see his primary care provider within several days.  He will also have a video capsule test done and pick this up either today or tomorrow and follow-up in several days with GI.  Discussed going back on his low-dose Eliquis with GI.  Discussed with cardiology and GI and discussed with the patient the risks, benefits and alternatives.

When I got home, I removed my shirt to find that I had a large rash that developed at the vaccine site.  I immediately applied hydrocortisone creme and started googling this event to find out that there was a condition known as delayed covid vaccine rash.  The hydrocortisone creme was only slightly effective, it still itched like crazy.  The next day I phoned my doctors office and asked if they could prescribe an ointment that is stronger than the over the counter ointment.  He prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide USP, 0/1%.  At first I didn't feel that the itching and swelling were subsiding but finally today, 5 days after onset, the ointment is working.  I still have the rash and it is still warm to touch but I think that it is improving. At the initial onset of the rash I started getting chills for the next few days and started feeling fatigued.

1132051,03/25/2021,MI,31.0,31,,F,,"On Saturday, February 20, 2021 I received my first dose of Moderna Lot# 024M20A. I was detained for 30 minutes due to having a sulfa allergy and then released. There were no concerns that day. My arm was very sore, which I was aware of could happen for a couple of days and then things seemed to clear up.  Sunday, February 28th, I woke up at 5 in the morning with a severe red, itchy rash that covered my arms, legs, chest, back, and scalp. I took Benadryl every 4 hours until 8pm in which symptoms grew worse and I drove myself to the Emergency Department.  Upon examination, the doctor diagnosed that this was a rash for nonspecific skin eruption. I was administered dexAMETHasone sodium phosphate (PF) (Decadron, EPINEPHrine (Adrenalin), and famotidine (Pepcid) at 10:32 pm. The epinephrine was supposed to relieve symptoms within thirty minutes and was administered into my left upper arm. It did not. They informed me that the steroid they gave me would take an additional 4-6 hours to kick in and would last 2-3 days. After detaining me to observe my body's reaction to the medicine; I was released approximately at 11:30 pm. They told me to continue taking Benadryl. At the end of the visit my vitals were as following: blood pressure: 113/69, weight 205 lbs, temperature 98.2 degrees F, pulse 91, respiration 18, oxygen saturation 99%.  I was only able to sleep 3 hours that night, wake up off and on due to severe inflammation and horrible itching.  Due to the lack of relief by the provided medication I began taking lukewarm oatmeal baths combined with cool showers every hour to help alleviate the itch. This helped to make the itching less strong but did not alleviate it all together. In between showers (no soap) I applied Calamine lotion and aloe vera lotion on every other rotation. These combined efforts helped to keep me from scratching as much as possible.   I was not able to go to work on Monday (3/1/21). Throughout the day of Monday, I continued to take repeated showers, baths, and apply lotion. I continued to take Benadryl as directed on the package. My rash did not seem to be clearing up and I was just able to make the itching slightly bearable. This continued through the night, where yet again I was only able to sleep 2-3 hours.  On Tuesday morning (3/2/21) I awoke with my back inflamed and hopped immediately into a cold shower. Upon my husband?s examination the rash suddenly had worsened. There were more breakouts of tiny itchy spots everywhere and the itching was unbearable.  As soon as Urgent Care opened at 8:00 am I checked myself in. My primary care physician was unable to secure me an appointment for the day and I couldn?t take it any longer. At this point I was so uncomfortable I started to feel helpless and hopeless.   I was seen by the PA-C at approximately 8:20 am. I informed the doctor that I had not had any changes to my diet, my medications, my laundry detergent, dish soap, body wash, lotions, toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, or any other thing of that nature. I had not been sick this year at all and I had not had any other vaccinations nor traveled outside of the country. Nor have I been quarantined this year because of Covid. I also told about my good friend in. She stated that exactly the same amount of days later after her Covid shot; she had a rash too but her rash disappeared after a couple of days and she did not need medical care for it nor was it itchy. I informed the doctor that the only thing I had that was new to my body was the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. It was the doctor's opinion that this was an allergic drug rash. The doctor also firmly recommended that I do not get the second dose of the Modern vaccine. He said that there have been credible reports released of delayed reactions such as this and even though there wasn?t a way yet to medically prove it, due to all of the information provided he strongly felt this was a reaction to the vaccine. My rash was so bad that as he lifted my shirt to look at it, even he was appalled.   I was administered methylPREDNISolone sodium succ (PF) (SOLU-Medrol) in the buttocks at 9:03 for treatment. I was also prescribed a predniSONE 50 mg tablet to take once daily with food for the next 8 days. Additionally I was prescribed triamcinolone 0.5% ointment to apply 2-3 times daily as needed for itching relief. I was released at approximately 10 am after an observation period to make sure I did not have a reaction to the methylPREDNISolone sodium succ (PF) (SOLU-Medrol). Upon my release I was given a doctor?s note to not return to work until Thursday 3/4/21. I was told to keep taking Benadryl along with the new medication to treat the rash. Approximately around noon hours later, I noticed an improvement in the rash on my arms. They were less spotty, inflamed and itchy. By 5 pm my legs were improving and were less itchy and spotty as well. I picked up my predniSONE prescription at 5:30 and took 1 tablet by mouth with food at approximately 6pm.  By late evening, the itching on my back, chest, and scalp had decreased by 50% although they were still majorly broken out. I did not take any more oatmeal baths but I did take a cool shower before bed using no soap.   On Wednesday 3/3/21 I awoke at 7 am. I was able to sleep through the night and only woke up twice to reapply aloe vera lotion. My arms and chest were no longer itchy but my back, scalp, shoulders, and behind my knees were still itchy. I was still very broke out on my chest and back but the skin did not appear to be as inflamed. My arms are no longer red and the spots are very tiny and pink. I picked up my triamcinolone 0.5% ointment at 10 am in the morning due to the pharmacy needing to order it. At approximately 11:30 am I canceled my 2nd dose appointment with that was scheduled for Friday, March 19th at 1:50 pm.   Thursday 3/4/21 I returned to work. I found myself to be very weak and very shaky if I stood for any amount of time. I had to work with students from my rolling chair, scooting around the classroom.  Sunday 3/7/21 I seem to have my strength back and am no longer shaky when I am trying to do daily tasks.  Thursday 3/11/21 It?s a week later and the bumps are finally  mostly cleared up. Half a dozen remain on my shoulders and have turned into pus filled bumps almost like pimples.   Thursday 3/25/21 All traces of the bumps are gone from my arms, legs, chest, and back. Only a couple of them remain now appearing to have turned into ?pimples?.

The needle hub effectively spooned the vaccine to splash in the reverse direction from that of the needle. The vaccine went into the nurses left eye and surrounding facial area(s).  The needle and hub remained in the patient?s arm, but it was removed immediately with no adverse effect, bleeding, or leaking of the vaccine suspension. The nurse apologized to the patient who was to receive the vaccine.  She told him that no vaccine was injected.  She said she would immediately prepare another 0.3mL dose of COVID-19 Pfizer BionTECH vaccine and **repeat the administration.    The man gave no vocal expression of refusal or display of guarding.

I stopped at an Aldi about 7 minutes away to use the restroom and get a snack, as I had been at the fairgrounds for about an hour and had not had breakfast.

Feeling a little concerned, but still feeling generally okay, I bought a Snickers bar and a Coke, thinking it would perk me up. I checked out at 10:39AM, and got on the highway to head for home. I drank a bit of Coke, then took a bite of my candy bar. It felt a little weird when I swallowed, but went down okay. I took two more small bites, and each was more difficult to swallow than the last, with the third one not clearing the back of my throat without several sips of Coke to wash it down. I was starting to feel panicky, but figured response time would be relatively slow, as I was traveling in between jurisdictions. I remember my late  husband giving me Benadryl after I had a weird reaction to a flu vaccine in 2014, so I focused on getting to a store down the road where I could stop quickly for some. This took another 5 minutes from where I was. I bought a box of Benadryl Liqui Gels, and took one in the parking lot.
