1266946,04/28/2021,NM,29.0,29,,F,,"I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday April 9th at 6pm. I did not feel any adverse effects beyond arm soreness around the injection site until the morning of Sunday April 11th, at which point I had exacerbated joint pain (likely an inflammation response). In the evening of the 11th, I noticed the soft tissues of both my mouth and vulva felt more raw/sensitive than usual. On the 12th this feeling persisted, with canker sores/mouth ulcers forming in my mouth/throat and a continued stinging/irritated feeling in my vulva. On the 13th this manifested as vulval ulcers, which were painful on their own and with pain dramatically increased while urinating. During the night of the 13th/morning of 14th I also woke up several times feeling either chilly/clammy or overheated, and took 800mg ibuprofen and slept through to the morning of the 14th. By the time I woke up I no longer had chills/fever symptom, but mouth and vulval ulcers had both progressed. The appearance of the vulval ulcers was crater-like patches with a white coloration surrounded by raised red rims, with several touching/against each other and surrounding tissue also inflamed/sensitive. On the 15th I made an appointment with urgent care as I was unable to use the bathroom without extreme pain and was unable to wipe the area and had to rinse in the shower to stay clean instead. From the Urgent Care clinician I was prescribed a 5% topical lidocaine ointment, a 4% over the counter lidocaine alternative option, and an antiviral course of Acyclovir. Bloodwork was done to rule out STIs. Applying the ointment 4-5 times a day before using the bathroom was the most effective part of treatment, although constant discomfort and inability to wear tight clothing/wash the area normally persisted for the following week. At peak, there were 10 visible ulcers ranging from 0.3cm-0.8cm in diameter, located on both inside sides of the labia and with some presenting as ""kissing sores"". After April 20th, they slowly grew smaller and began to recede although intense pain persisted. At this point my mouth sores had also diminished and were fading at a faster rate than the vulvar sores, with minimal disruption to function besides avoiding particularly sharp/spicy/salty foods. I kept up use of the topical numbing cream on the vulvar ulcers until April 26th, at which point most sores had healed and I was able to urinate and bathe in a normal manor, although I still needed to be gentle/the area still felt sensitive. At the time of writing this report (April 28th), I still see some redness/potential scarring but there are no longer open sores and there is no noticeable pain/sensitivity.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/09/2021,04/11/2021,2,Blood test on Friday April 16th to rule out STIs; results were negative including for HSV,PHM,,"Jasmiel (birth control), Dapsone 5% (topical facial acne ointment), Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Benxol Peroxide 2.5% gel (topical facial acne ointment)",None,"I do not have a diagnosis as my doctors have not been able to determine a direct cause, but I am more prone to developing canker sores/mouth ulcers than average, and I have had canker sore outbreaks triggered by bad colds/upper respiratory infections in the past.",,,2,04/28/2021,,,Y,None

Logged out at around 5:30pm  4/7 @ 9:00am ? dizziness started getting worse. Started feeling imbalance and started losing depth perception which climbing down staircase  4/8 @ 10:00am ? started to get easily startled by any unexpected trigger. Whole body would ?twitch? or ?startle? upon slightest unexpected event. For e.g., sound, touch, taste (hot/cold)  4/10 @ 12:00pm ? Went to ER. ER ordered series of book tests, EKG, chest x-ray. Everything came out normal. ER doctor said to wait it out and after a week symptom may go away. ER doctor felt body?s immune response was over-working due to the vaccine immune response and possibly pollen allergy I may have experienced right after getting the vaccine. No prescription meds give. Advised to take Meclizine 25mg and Zyrtec. Below are the symptoms experienced on 4/10:  ? Lightheadedness/Sudden Jerking body movements when triggered/passing out momentarily for a second when taking strain/not in my elements ? Feeling extremely fatigued. Did not sleep well at night on 4/8 and 4/9 ? Head feels Intoxicated, foggy, lightheaded, as if stuffed with cotton candy. Startled when unexpected things happen like a sudden jerking movement along with momentary passing out while anything unexpected happens. E.g., when I am pushing myself on the sofa to re-position, I feel my whole body is turning off for a second. Simply does not feel normal ? Rubbery legs ? Worsens after shower. I feel like I need to lay down as the foggy feeling worsens after shower ? Lightheadedness. Losing control sometimes. ? I am easily startled when climbing down the stairs - no Depth perception. ? Don?t have the strength to blow nose or cough. Feels like momentary fainting when doing these activities ? Dis-equilibrium. Whole body is twitching when something unexpected happens to my senses. ? Unable to control while laughing feels like momentary faint. I have felt like this when I was down with a fever. Tickled easily ? Difficulty pulling myself out of bed. Felt like muscle was giving away ? Tingling feeling in the right abdomen area ? Difficulty staying alert or focused and random rather unpleasant thoughts constantly coming to mind. Felt a bit of panic attack.  4/11 ? Went to PCP. Body weakness and fatigue got worse. PCP did blood sugar test and flushed out the left ear. Ordered Brain MRI to see if structurally anything was wrong. Brain MRI came out OK as well however noticed minor sinusitis. Prescribed Amoxicillin antibiotics and nasal spray. Referred me to Neurologist and Head and Neck Specialist.  4/11 ? 4/15 - Above symptoms progressively got worse. Especially weakness in the arms and shoulders. Arms quivered every time trying to stand up and felt like fainting. Hand-eye coordination progressively got worse. For e.g., could not pick up water bottle, hands were quivering badly  4/15 ? Neurologist conducted certain diagnostic tests and concluded that there are no neurological issues. Said with rest and plenty of fluids it should get better. Spinal tap was not recommended and said if symptoms got worse a spinal tap can be done during the next visit. Follow up visit with neurologist scheduled on 4/27  4/15 ? 4/27 ? Weakness in arms got better. Arm strength and coordination has improved however it?s still not back to normal. Brain fog and dizziness still persists with no improvement. Left limb and arms are stronger than the left. Difficulty climbing up and down stairs. Dizziness worsens after shower. Not feeling myself. In addition, not able to multitask - getting startled and need to be deliberate about having to do everyday chores need to just focus on one task 100% completely and if something else comes up then my body just goes into a momentary shock. Mostly I can feel my head feeling heavy and my eyelids shutting down when something shocking happens ? a feeling like body is ?turning off?, almost a fainting or passing out feeling. Sometimes when I turn to one side and sleep, I can feel a flickering sensation in the ear. Still always feeling woozy and as if there is something in my head ? a medicated or intoxicated feeling in the head  4/27 ? Neurologist said she sees a lot of improvement and reiterated again that I don?t have any neurological issues. She said I can go back to work starting 5/1. She said I may have Conversion Disorder / Disequilibrium.

He had a drawing feeling in her left arm, which she ignored and otherwise felt fine.  Got the dog in the car, started to drive home, and got on her exit and within 3-5 minutes to get on the road going to her street felt a little weird and had blurry vision, and then it was really blurry and then she realized she was having a reaction.  There was dirt on the right side of the road and turned her car there and remember hitting the hazard lights and not having any vision at all.  Her left side was completely numb, and her right arm was extremely heavy and she was able to get her phone, but could move her fingers still and kept clicking on her phone until she got the Town Center where she got the vaccine.  She got a hold of them and got a hold of someone, and then she was completely paralyzed with a swollen tongue as well, and not able to be understood.  She stayed with her on the phone and was hardly able to make out the signs to let them know where possibly was so that they could find her.  She could barely feel her fingers at that point, and was just able to move her eyes.  She also felt fuzzy and was able to communicate.  The lady got hold of 9-1-1 and able to look up her phone # from the vaccine center who had her address and information.  It was a 3 way phone call, and it took them 35-45 minutes to find her, and two police officers passed by her right next to her with hazzards on.   Finally she heard the fire truck and was able to tell the lady that the ambulance went by her and they finally found her.   Her pulse was irratic and was able to tell them that she was not able to move and that her chest was heavy and took her to the ambulance.  She was able to move her arm a little bit and then it fell back down again.  Her vital signs were not normal so they were going to take her to the hospital.  They texted her exboyfriend to come and get her dog and he came and got her car and dog.   They took her to the hospital and they were not able to get vein access on the ambulance, and they put her in a wheelchair and not able to hold her head up.     She was in the wheelchair for about 4 1/2 hours without any vein access, no blood drawn and nobody attending to her.  Finally a nurse came in and put her in another wheelchair and pushed her to the other side and was able to get a little more comfortable.   The nurse came in and said something about her Ex-boyfriend who is a heart surgeon at that particular hospital.  Once she was on this new wheelchair and was finally able to move her toes, hands, and fingers and little by little sensation came back as she was a gymnast for 30 years and was flexing to try to gain motion.   She was able to finally get up and weakly walk and they released her after giving her a  Benadryl.     Since going home she feels heavy (arms feels like cement), weaker, and does not feel completely herself, and went for a walk yesterday (which she is normally able to hike 5-8 miles) and has been dropping things due to either weakness or nerve issues.

At the direction of my primary care doctor, I went to an urgent care where my blood pressure was around 140/80 (I do not have a personal history of high blood pressure, and it was just checked at a normal rate at few weeks prior to receiving the vaccine) and my resting heartrate sat in the high 140s. The urgent care I went to at the time did not have a working EKG; however, they monitored my vitals and provided Motrin for the pain. After about an hour at urgent care, my resting heartrate lowered to 130s and the pain subsided. By the next morning, it still hovered around 110 and my blood pressure remained slightly elevated; however, the chest pains and pressure had completely subsided. The timeline for pain lasted roughly 5 hours, the timeline for heightened resting heart rate and blood pressure lingered for about 12 hours.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/13/2021,04/14/2021,1,,PHM,,Daily multivitamin,N/A,N/A,,,2,04/28/2021,,,Y,N/A

I began menstruation on Friday, April 9. Further, I slept 4pm-8pm, did some computer work from 9pm-3am, and went back to sleep. These symptoms were expected. Saturday's symptoms were not expected, regardless of onset of menstruation, and are what I would consider the adverse event. All day Saturday, I experienced massive melancholy, sadness, hopelessness, and general emotional angst. This is not normal for me, even during my period; I experienced this affect consistently years ago, from 2015-2017, when I was originally diagnosed with depression. Since 2017/2018, I have been in a much healthier emotional state, and have used an SSRI for the last 6 months with success. The following day, Sunday, I began a monophasic combination birth control, which was an original plan prescribed by a physician.  Following this, I experienced roughly 7-10 days of adverse emotional response, namely anger and aggression and mood swings, until I stopped using the new birth control on April 22. My emotional wellbeing took this roughly 7-10 days to recover. The mood change I experienced on Saturday, April 10, based on my previous experiences, was more similar to the mood change I experienced while being depressed rather than the mood change I experience from menstruation and PMS. I strongly request thoughtful consideration of the impact of the vaccine on short-term emotional and mental health changes.

The patient stated she had Pernio which was an autoimmune in her toes and it was not a new thing as she had it for years but she had a bad flare up in one of her toes since she received the first dose of the vaccine. It could also be due to the cold weather since that triggers it, and it had been snowing, so the vaccine may not have anything to do with it.

She stated it was hard to say when it started since she had this condition for a number of years and this one was mainly a blister, but she got the vaccine on 05Mar2021 so she probably first noticed it on Wednesday 10Mar2021 or Thursday 11Mar2021.

The doctor said he was going to administer it right now because she cannot breathe. At this time, she was conscious and had a hard time breathing, but was listening. The doctor administered the shot and the hard time breathing and coughing stopped like 30 seconds after. However, she is still having a hard time to breathe.

The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization.

At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby's scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular.

She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn't find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor's told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She's been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn't do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported.

She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn't know what made it go up. Then states she doesn't know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day.

The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no relevant medical history. Patient reported that she has people in the family that have had heart problems. Concomitant medication included unspecified vitamins.

The patient previously took steroid injections 2 years ago (2019) and had heart palpitations before. The patient further mentioned that normally after the steroids wear off, the heart palpitations go away. The patient reported that she did not have any problems following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she had a little fatigue and site pain for just a couple of days but that everything was fine. Patient reported that she felt a little heart palpitations for maybe a day or two and then it was gone following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, she noticed the heart palpitations again and a little shortness of breath. The heart palpitations and shortness of breath were nothing that she felt that she had to run to the emergency room or anything over. The patient reported that now it was getting difficult for her to sleep sometimes at night because of the heart rate. The patient also reported that she was trying to figure out that from this length of time between her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021 and time of call on 14Apr2021, could the heart palpitations be a side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient also mentioned that when she experienced heart palpitations before, a whole work up was ordered and she was referred to cardiology and that nothing was found during the work up after previous experience with heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that she has been fine, that she has been able to work and walk and that she gets her 10,000 steps every day. After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, she was tired and didn't feel like her normal self. The patient also reported that when the time had arrived to get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, about a week before, she may have had a little fast heart rate but not constant. It was also reported that following her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, the fatigue started about the same time as it did following the first dose, on the second day post-vaccine on 30Mar2021. Patient reported that she was kind of tired and just taking a nap during the day. The fatigue was still ongoing. It was also reported that patient was starting to feel better other than the heart palpitations. The patient reported that yesterday, 13Apr2021, she felt great and could do her normal routine, other than feeling chest pains and palpitations. The heart palpitations are not constant, but are more regular during the day than she was used to. The heart palpitations were really bad last night, 13Apr2021, and that she had difficulty sleeping because of heart rate (couldn't hardly sleep at all). The patient's doctor was scheduling her for an echocardiogram. The patient's doctor did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on her on 08Apr2021 and there was nothing there (normal). The patient's doctor was scheduling her for a stress echocardiogram. The patient also mentioned that after returning from the physician's office, her husband went back and looked at the symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine information sheet. The patient reported that her husband thought that she needed to call to eliminate everything, that they are trying to figure out why the patient was experiencing the heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that 2 days ago she got on her treadmill to walk and went for 30 minutes. Patient reported that it normally takes her 5 minutes to recuperate, but that time it took her 20 minutes before she felt comfortable after her walk. The patient also reported that the site pain was nothing serious following both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The site pain began shortly after receiving the vaccine and went away after the second day following both vaccines. The shortness of breath probably started about 5 days after she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The shortness of breath wasn't enough that she felt that she needed to run to the emergency room. It just felt like when she would breathe, especially at night as she normally breathes with her mouth closed at night, the patient felt like she had to open her mouth to breathe because she can still feel the pressure in chest. The patient was still experiencing the heart palpitations. The heart palpitations are a little worse because they happen so often. Patient reported that initially, she would have a few heart palpitations and then go for hours with none. Patient reported that now, she was feeling the heart palpitations quite a bit. Patient reported that it feels kind of like a little pressure in her chest and then it'll feel like little flutters. The patient further reported that she experiences a little pressure in her chest when she experiences the heart palpitations. At times, the chest pressure would go away, but she always feels the chest pressure there now. The chest pressure has gotten worse over the past couple of weeks and that she was thinking that it would go away like the first one did. Patient reported that she went to the doctor last week and was given an EKG. Patient reported that the EKG was fine and that her physician was scheduling other tests to make sure it's nothing with her heart. The patient didn't think that the heart palpitations and shortness of breath were from the COVID-19 vaccine, but that her husband looked at the vaccine information paper after her doctor's appointment and said she should call Pfizer.

Caller provided these all started 2 weeks after he got the shot. Started on Saturday, 03Apr2021, and same thing happened everyday (going on). He called the weekend and after a couple weeks he called, the on call doctor and after his second call he was ordered to get to a medical facility/ urgent care facility (went to the doctor and it wasn't his regular doctor) in the weekend of 11Apr2021 and he has one nearby and they ran a test for COVID and it was negative, also tested for strep throat positive.

He was ordered not to take the 2nd dose until he finishes all the amoxicillin and was told quite sternly not to get the 2nd dose until he finishes it. He has 12 pills left so next week sometime Tuesday or Wednesday and his concern was he finished that medicine and feels he would still have these side effects and doesn't know if he would build up immunity and maybe the 2nd shot won't be as bad. The nurse practitioner who worked with him at the urgent medical care place said the 2nd shot is a doozy and not to mix it with Amoxicillin as it might have a bad effect on the effectiveness of the strep throat.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 09Mar2021 at 08:30 (batch/lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient has no medical history and no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization and got sick on an unspecified date. No prior vaccination (within 4 weeks prior). No family history related to adverse events. The patient experienced she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely on 09Mar2021. She said that she wanted to let Pfizer know about the symptoms she had gone through when she got the shot. She received her first shot 09Mar2021 and it was at 08:30 am and then around mid-afternoon that same day she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely. She has a nebulizer machine and she used that and it opened up her lungs but it didn't open her nose up at all. So she sat up for a couple of nights with her nose not working right and she had to breathe out of her mouth. Days later here nose finally opened up and it was breathing good but she still had a hard time with her breathing when she was doing anything that was exerting herself to get things done. She would become short of breath. It was kind of that way when she went in for her second one, she was better at that time but she wasn't the greatest. When she had went in for second shot and told them about what she experienced after the first shot, they didn't do anything and they said that was what should be happening which was scary. They gave her the second shot even though she was very reluctant on it and she did it anyways. With that, what she experienced was even worse than what she experienced with the first shot. She got her second shot on 30Mar2021 in the morning and then the same thing pretty much happened as the first one, only it was a lot worse with her lungs and her nose. Her lungs did the same thing where they had closed and her nose did the same thing where it closed as well. She already had everything ready to use for nebulizing and that opened her lungs but it didn't open her nose for at least 3 days or maybe it took longer for her nose to open. She had sat up for 4 nights trying to sleep. She was breathing through her mouth because she couldn't breathe through her nose. It was a horrible time trying to breathe. It was unreal. It was kind of scary when you're trying to breathe and you're not getting any air. She had went to her clinic and she was put on a heavier nebulizer and that that one kind of opened up her lungs and her nose and then her doctor also put her on prednisone. Besides that she was given another nebulizer that wasn't as harsh or intense for her to use for all of her reactions or if she needed it during the night. Finally she was getting back on the mend now to where at least she can breathe through her nose and her mouth. Her provider thought that she should report this because she just cant figure it out. She knows that when she gets flu shots she gets sick and the same thing happens like now. The first time she got a flu shot she was sick like that for a week and she thought that maybe it was just a fluke so she did it a second time and the same thing happened. With this shot, she didn't know if she would want to get it again or not but people say that you should so she thought to give it a chance and then it turned out the same way with the second shot. It was not good. She doesn't know if there was something in those that was not a good thing or her to have or what. She didn't end up in the hospital even though she was pretty close to going up there. Probed for names, , lot numbers and expiry dates for all previously mentioned medications such as the different nebulizers, prednisone, and the flu shots from previously and she says that they were fairly new, she doesn't have the box now because she used them and when she was done she tossed it. The products weren't old and they didn't have old expiry dates. Probed for information such as , lot number and expiry dates for previously administered flu shots and she declined to provide and said that was many years ago. Provided mailing address and then caller stated that she doesn't want to be bombarded with anything if it has nothing of importance but she doesn't want it really. She doesn't want a lot of stuff to read through if it was not of importance. Informed caller that all information was voluntary in what we ask and she does not have to provide her mailing address was if she was not comfortable doing so and she asked this agent to remove her mailing it's because she always hears stuff on the news. Caller confirmed that this was her first time speaking to someone about what she has experienced. Probed if her side effects began on the same day she received her vaccine, 09Mar2021 and 30Mar2021 and caller said that for the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 09Mar2021 the side effects started mid-afternoon and for the second dose on 30Mar2021 the side effects started a little later and it wasn't on the same day. She had started feeling it that day but she really felt them the next day. She could tell it was kind of starting to do it at a slower process but when it happened it was really worse then the first time. Caller confirmed dates of 09Mar2021 and 31Mar2021 for when her side effects began and she says she was still feeling a little bit like she did with the side effects. She still has where if she was doing a little more exertion stuff then it seems like she still was having to sometimes stop and get her breath but it was getting better now. She doesn't want to go through that again, that was horrible. Caller said it seemed like if you didn't get the COVID vaccine then you couldn't go out in public without a mask on for the rest of your life or even if you go to some places, like a concert or an event, if you didn't have the COVID vaccine then they were going to card you and if you didn't, you know what. She has a friend who went to get it because he was working and he was around people and she thought that was important too with her being around him and that was the other reason she got the COVID vaccine. She didn't really want to but she did it anyways. She probably should of just taken her chances and if she got COVID then she got it and it probably wouldn't be as bad as putting something into her system that doesn't even like her. It was hard. That was just how she was feeling. It was a bad thing, you know. Her mom couldn't (well, she has been gone since 2000) but anyways, her mom could never get flu shots either years ago. The caller doesn't know if there was something with that that she doesn't know. All she knew was that these shots don't like her. Probed for relevant test results, concomitant products and medical conditions and caller says no, she was not sick and she didn't take anything before. She wasn't sick, if she was sick she would have thought that maybe she felt like not from the sock but she didn't feel sick. She takes her temperature every day and she has been for the better part of this whole last year and she never had a fever. She couldn't take her temperature during all this because she couldn't breathe when her mouth was shut. She said that the only thing what she doesn't really understand was that if you can still get COVID after getting the shots, then why were people still doing the shots. It just makes her wonder why was everything doing something like this and it can still happen. To her it didn't really make sense. After she found out that you can still get COVID after this thing she thought well what's the point. She just thought that she would let Pfizer know about what she experienced and that this was a lot worse than when she had the flu shot with the side effects. The flu shot was minor compared to this thing, the COVID vaccines, she felt like she almost could of died. This was most definitely by far a lot worse. She would rather have the flu shot and have a minor thing than this one this was bad. She doesn't know what was in it or what caused her to have this total reaction where she couldn't breath and it was bad. She really doesn't want to do this again either. She doesn't know if there was something in this one or whatever, but it doesn't like her big time. She doesn't know if Pfizer has heard of this where people had trouble breathing after they got this done but she kind of wonders. She listens to the news and on there you don't really hear any side effects caused or how people are dealing with the symptoms. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. Vaccination facility, it was a clinic, well it was between that and the hospital that was connected to the clinic so kind of right inside the hospital area going to clinic, maybe it was the hospital. The adverse events required a visit to a physician's office because she got to the point to where she couldn't breathe. She was even having trouble walking across the parking lot so she ended up going in because she couldn't breathe. No relevant tests done. The outcome of the events ""she started to feel like her lungs were starting to close up and her nose closed up completely"" was recovering and unknown for the other event.

1270172,04/29/2021,,60.0,60,,F,,"1/11/2021: Within 40 minutes of receiving 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine, began having tingling bilateral arms proximal & distal.  Following day, developed a temperature to 102F which remained x4 days.  Since this time, has had continued tingling of the arms & low grade temperature (99F) & has begun having weakness of her upper extremities only with hypersensitivity to heat, as well as touch, but interestingly having decreased sensation to touch of her fingers, feeling as though she wears gloves, with no weakness anywhere else on her body.  She has also beginning to develop a sense of decrease cognition.  She has been seen by Neurology who felt this was a neurologic hypersensitivity reaction. Initially when she began having complaints following injections/day 1, she was given Benadryl with no improvement beyond causing her to sleep.  Since this time she has also been placed on prednisone with no interval improvement.  Relates no cutaneous lesions beyond mottling of her arms/no frank urticaria dermatitis etc., and has had no GI complaints or cardiovascular sequela.  4/19/21: This 60 y.o., female is referred by MD for evaluation of bilateral hand pain, weakness and numbness starting shortly after the 2nd dose of her COVID vaccine (5 her). The patient has generally been in excellent health.  On Monday, January 11th at 9:20 a.m. she received the 2nd dose of COVID vaccine  (Pfizer), in the left deltoid.  She had no immediate reaction but while driving about 45 min later developed numbness and tingling bilaterally in her face, lips, tongue and hands.  She awakened at about 3:00 a.m. with fever of 102, no abnormal sensations in her face but pain, redness and sensitivity in both hands. Systemic symptoms resolved in several days. Hand symptoms have continued to date.  Pain can range as high as 8/10.  She has marked sensitivity such that if she or someone else touches her hands it is extremely painful.  She sleeps with opera gloves to protect them.  She has not had neck pain but has developed grip weakness and has to use 2 hands to hold a cup of coffee.   She has never had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past.  She has had no immunologic disorders.  She initially saw Dr. who tried a short course of steroids without benefit.  She took gabapentin 200 mg followed by 100 and slept for hours without a change in the pain. NSAIDs have been ineffective.  No other medications have been tried.  She has had nothing to suggest a symptomatic COVID infection.  4/23/21: The patient continues to have bilateral hand sensitivity and temperature lability.  The EMG showed diffusely slow sensory conductions, consistent with the non correctable low temperature of her hands.  Motor conductions were notable for slowing in the right median motor with drop in amplitude proximally but with waveforms that did not suggest conduction block.  All motor terminal latencies and F response latencies were normal.  Overall the study is probably normal within technical limitations but if necessary should be repeated in about a month with her hands warmer.  The nortriptyline was just approved yesterday and the blood tests 2 days ago.  She will start the nortriptyline over the weekend and let me know if it is tolerable or effective.  She will get the blood work done early next week and I will review the results with her. HISTORY:  This patient with bilateral hand dysesthesias and temperature lability following COVID vaccination comes in for neurophysiologic testing.  Notably the nortriptyline was just approved and she has not yet started taking it.  Similar the blood test were just approved 2 days ago and she will have them drawn next week.

She had me do different tests and concluded I had no neurological issues. She gave me a prescription for butalb-apap-caf50. This did not help. She also told me not to drink alcohol so I didn?t. I started feeling better on 4/24. I had a little to drink and my head hurt really bad. My headache was practically nonexistent 4/25 so I had one glass of wine.

1270546,04/29/2021,MD,50.0,50,,M,,"On April 1, 2021, I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Center and the only side effect from the vaccine at that time was localized soreness at the injection site of my left shoulder.   On April 2, 2021, earlier that day the soreness at the injection site began to dissipate after doing push-ups and massaging my left arm. After going to bed last night and that night is when the additional side effects started.  I was awakened by itching on both arms which had formed whelps from my shoulder to my forearm.   For the next 13 days, the whelps and itching were sparsely during the day (which had consumed my legs, upper torso as well as arms) as they presented the illusion to be getting better but would flare up at night while sleeping. I attempted to do home remedies from Calamine lotion, Benadryl and cold showers but nothing seemed to effectively work against the itching and the whelps that resembled Hives.    On April 13, 2021, while at work a new side affect began which was the swelling of my bottom lip (particularly the right half) along with itching in my throat.  The swelling reduced itself as I continued to work through the night but the discomfort in my throat continued. The whelps and itching were still sparsely present as well.   On April 14, 2021, later that morning, post work, the reduced swelling of my lower lip and throat discomfort I decided to go to the ER. While enroute to the ER, my top lip began to tingle and swell. These events made me more concerned about the severity I was experiencing since receiving the vaccine.   After checking into the ER and being triaged, the doctor informed me that I would be hospitalized overnight due to the swelling of my upper lip, elongated tonsils, elevated blood pressure and the diagnosis of whelps as Hives. For the next three nights I was intravenous administered Epinephrine, Benadryl and Prednisone.   On April 16, 2021, the third night I was discharged from the hospital with the same medications and informed to follow up with an allergist.",,,,,Y,2,,,U,04/01/2021,04/02/2021,1,"4/14/2021:  In the ED he is mildly hypertensive, otherwise VS are stable.

She denied any nausea, she was alert and oriented x 3 after resolution of seizure activity. She was transported to ED for further evaluation. Report was provided to  at ED.  Seen by Neuro on 4/23/21: Interim History: Patient is a 30 yr, right-handed woman with no significant medical history who is referred for evaluation of an episode of LOC.   The episode occurred on 4/9/2021,10 minutes after receiving the 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine. She reports feeing anxious after receiving the dose because of the history of having passed out after receiving vaccines. As with the previous events, she felt ""hot and clammy"" and had tunnel vision before losing consciousness for approximately 15 seconds.  She was told that she ""shook all over"" for a few second. Upon regaining consciousness, she was oriented almost immediately and was not confused. The episode occurred while sitting.    Patient reports a history of at least 5 syncopal events, since age 12 yr, with 4 of these occurring while sitting and 2 while standing. All of the evens have occurred either after receiving vaccines in 2016 or undergoing medical procedures. Two of the events also include shaking movements but none have been associated with tongue biting, urinary incontinence or post event confusion.    She also reports a  history of episodes of lightheadedness with postural changes but denies palpitations, CP or SOB.  She has never had a neurological or cardiac evaluation.

She has a history of similar episodes occurring after vaccinations or medical procedures. She reports episodes of pre-syncope and postural lightheadedness. She does not have risk factors for epilepsy and the episodes have an atypical duration for convulsive seizures.   In my opinion, the recent event is not an allergic reaction to the vaccine and there is no contraindication for receiving the 2nd dose.    Plan: I suggested taking lorazepam 1 mg prior to getting the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine and to consider consultation with a cardiologist at some future time (but not required prior to obtaining the 2nd dose).

Went to ED on the 20th because she started to have arm shaking, she was given ativan, her arm shaking stopped and they discharged her home. That evening her fingers felt clenched. On the 21st she woke up in the morning, went to urinate and dropped to the floor because her legs felt like jello and felt like they kept giving out. They initially thought the ativan was just making her feel out of it. They waited until the evening but then needed to go to the ED. The concern was GBS and transverse myelitis. They ate dinner and decided to drive to ED, on the drive she was kind of falling asleep periodically. Then she suddenly couldn't lift her water bottle. She started to be completely out of it, Mom says she wasn't responding. Pt says that she felt like she knew what was going on, felt a little out of body and wasn't quite responding. Mom couldn't get her out of the car, she was carried into the ED and at that point she started to recover a little bit more. About 10 minutes later she started to feel better. She was admitted because she was still having trouble walking. In the hospital she had a normal CT head and video EEG but she didn't have any events while on the monitor. Discharged home the following day with the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder and instructions to establish care with an adult PCP. They advised considering CBT as well.  Since discharge her legs feels tired, going up the stairs feels much harder than it should. She has not had any falls and no longer feels like she is going to fall.  She follows with a therapist, has had dissociative episodes and panic attacks in the past.   Assessment:  20 YOF with PMH of panic attack, POTS, IDA and benign heart murmur who developed weakness of b/l LE and altered consciousness approximately 10 days after her first dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. Also had an episode of unilateral arm shaking the day prior that resolved with ativan in the ED. At this point unclear if directly related to vaccination. Differential includes mild Guillain-Barre 2/2 previous infection or vaccination, stress reaction/anxiety, POTS complication, myasthenia gravis, tick bite, infection, heavy metal poisoning, B12 deficiency, seizure disorder, atypical migraine. Functional Neurologic Disorder diagnosed by neurology after overnight admission  for video EEG which captured no events. CT head  also WNL per neurology discharge summary. Neurologic exam today WNL.   After Second Vaccine: History: She had her 2nd vaccine on 4/15 (6 days ago). Had vaccine in right arm again, she did have some arm pain again. She had coffee without breakfast in the morning. Had finished her first virtual class, went to the restroom during her second class, felt strangely in the restroom, went back to her room. She then passed out. Her fall was unwitnessed. She called to her roommate when she came to but her roommate hadn't heard the fall. She thinks she was only out for a few seconds but cannot be sure. Called her Mom who advised her to eat something so she ate an orange sitting on the floor. She got up to make herself breakfast and she passed out again. Again unwitnessed but patient thinks it was very fast. She crawled over to the couch, sat on the couch for for 15 minutes then felt fine for the rest of the day. She did not feel nauseous at all. She denies palpitations, difficulty breathing and chest pain.  Today in office after orthostatics and blood draw she fainted again, only out for seconds. BP elevated immediately after the event but WNL minutes later.  These syncopal episodes reminded her of her syncopal episodes with IDA and POTS. They do not feel like the episode after the first vaccine when she lost feeling in her legs and was very out of it.  She feels like her arm pain from the first vaccine never fully resolved. After the arm pain worsened from the 2nd shot she tried a 3 day course of aleve to see if that helped things. At this point it is mostly just her right wrist that is painful. Overall feels more localized to wrist than prior. She has since stopped the aleve, last was last night. She has not noticed redness or swelling in wrist or arm.  LMP was 4/2-4/6. She went almost a year without menses so stopped her OCP, but her menses have returned recently and she has restarted OCP.  Assessment: Right arm pain persisted from the first vaccination but otherwise sx had resolved. She got 2nd vaccination on 4/15, only arm pain but yesterday had 2 brief syncopal events and one today in the office.

He reports onset starting yesterday. The pain radiated around to his back into the center of his chest. Thought he had pulled a muscle was having heartburn. Taking a deep breath made the pain worse. He tried Tums but no significant relief. It was not associated with shortness breath. Denied any, lower extremity swelling or calf pain.  Today the pain was acutely worse so presented to the emergency department for evaluation. No prior DVT, PE, no FH of DVT/PE. No weight loss. No recent prolonged trip. On arrival to the emergency department his pulse was noted to be elevated to 120 but otherwise vitals unremarkable.  CT angiogram thorax had significant findings of multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli involving segmental and subsegmental vessels.  There was no evidence of right heart strain.  He was started on heparin drip and transferred to another facility for ongoing care. He was switched to Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, then 5 mg bid for 3 months.  He has not sign of any malignancy, no weigh loss. He received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/4/21 and 4/1/21. It is conceivable that this PE could be complication of COVID-19 vaccine. He should follow up with PCP in 1 week.              CTA also showed partial visualization of gas fluid collection within the right upper quadrant, likely reflecting a duodenal diverticulum which was present on 8/20/2012 CT abdomen, incompletely assessed.

Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 & Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He'd never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn't abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like ""covid toes"". Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium & nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs.

SECOND DOSE on 4/2/2021 was a different story.  About 15 hours later at 3:00 am I woke up with 100.5 fever, SEVERE pain at injection site (like someone had punched me in the arm and bruised my arm), and SEVERE level 9 (out of 10) pain in all joints in my hand and two big toes.  Fibromyalgia muscular pain SEVERE level 9.  Headache, SEVERE fatigue - could not get out of bed very well.  SEVERE brain fog - I could barely think logically.  I tried taking 50mg full spectrum CBD oil to avoid taking an NSAID (I was concerned it would affect proper immune response).  At 6:29 am the fever was lower, but I could no longer take the pain, so I took 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil).  4-6 hours later took another 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil) and stayed in bed and slept several times that day.  For the next two days the severe brain fog and severe fatigue remained.  I continued to take 400mg Advil as needed.  The brain fog was so severe that if I picked up my keys (or any other object), I would immediately ?lose? them and not know where they were because I had placed them somewhere else and could not remember anything.  I stayed home for at least 72 hours due to the fatigue and the fear of driving and possibly getting in an accident.  It seems the high severity of the issues lasted 72 hours, but all of the above reported issues continued for several weeks at a lower severity - with fatigue being the worst - requiring one or two naps per day.  As of today, April 29, there is still slight pain in all hand joints and some fatigue, but there seems to be gum issues (hurting) since about April 26th.  I am brushing my teeth lightly, using ?Smart Mouth? zinc oral rinse, and sucking/chewing on a whole clove every once in a while for pain relief and for the anti-biotic properties.

I'd never noticed this visually, nor had they itched or ever been otherwise noticeable/bothersome.  This first week was 'hypersensitive' to things I typically wouldn't be. 4/5 - Received my first vaccine. Slight/mild arm tenderness at injection site (left arm) on and off starting a few hrs later.  4/6 - Continued mild arm tenderness. Upper back (where previously noted bumps were) was very hot. Upper lip was minorly swollen (not visibly, by touch only)  4/7 -  Was very sensitive to some smells - flowers in my house were very intense which also resulted in minor headache. I don't typically have this type of reaction and the same flowers the days prior and after didn't elicit this response. Went to chiro for an adjustment that evening.  4/8 - Upper back and neck stiffness. Occasionally after an adjustment I'll be tight but never like this.  At some point this first week or possibly the week after, there were electric like 'pops' throughout my left side lower leg.  4/11 - Started Vitamin and Supplement regiment from doctor  4/12 - Started detox diet to remove all 'sensitive' foods. Had acupuncture.  4/13 or 14 - The injection site started minor itching and looked like a small bug bite (raised and rounded). Can't recall if this lasted 1 or 2 days.  At some point during the 2nd week and continuing through the 3rd week my sinus started acting up - this is not unusual and I don't attribute to the vaccine, but I do think that the vaccine contributed to the sinus issue making me feel more drained of energy and 'hot' all over (but not a full out fever) than 'normal' for when it (my left sinus) acts up.  4/19 - Upper back was hot and quite itchy (very small eczema like bumps) during the afternoon; in the evening arm also was itchy.  4/20 - Work up with rash on injection (left) arm - small area where injection was and larger area slightly below that. Rash was more hot, as opposed to itchy. Mild brain fog / lack of energy (though also didn't get a ton of sleep and my sinus was acting up too - don't think the sinus was likely related to the shot). Felt all over hot, but short of feverish.  4/22 - By end of day the rash was gone. Heart palpitations and could feel my heart beating against my chest all day long. Leg ""throbbing pulse"" in lower left leg - comes and goes.  At some point around here it became harder to breathe in the sense that I was breathing fine, but felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen, i.e. needing to breathe deeper than normal and was getting tension in my temples.  4/23 - Minor heart ""flutters"" in the am and evening, but not during the day/as intense as the day before.  4/24 & 4/25 - leg ""pulses"" less noticeable, but still occurring. Alternating around the lower leg and upper leg - a few even up in buttocks area.  4/26 - leg ""pulses"" more noticeable - at times more of a sustained throb rather than quicker 'pulse'. Mostly in the lower leg and the upper leg right above the knee toward the interior of the thigh. Acupuncture in the evening specifically addressing my 'fire points' which were 'acting up' - felt overall more relaxed, leg pulses less noticeable and could more easily breathe.   4/27 to 4/29- leg 'pulses' still continue but 90-95% better than previously - not as frequent or severe.

I was fine the entire day of Thursday, February 18, 2021, until Friday afternoon, but on Friday evening of March 19, I had chest pain, palpitations(reached 130), my lips, legs, and arms trembled, and my b/p reached 188/89. Because of muscle pain localized in the chest, and as I just had the vaccination less than 48 hours earlier, I was compelled to rush to the ER to make sure it was not a heart attack. During the ER Consult, my Potassium Level was low. I feel that we have to look into the causality if the vaccine could also cause hypokalemia. Additionally, I had the same symptoms last Saturday evening(February 20) evening around 8pm. I had to call a friend to stay with me as my b/p reached 193/93. It subsided around midnight:116/72.

1271906,04/29/2021,FL,47.0,47,,F,,"It's 7 days later and I am still not well - face swelling, hot to the touch (similar to when I had staph infection) Nausea is new as of today, migraine has come back (was present up until yesterday afternoon and started to dissipate and now back in full force). I have had 17 concussions in my lifetime so it feels like that a bit, foggy, can't stand for long, fatigue. Here are my symptoms by days. Would have sent this sooner but couldn't function or look at screen- really sick. I am still sick and not sure if this is normal or I should be going to the ER or some type of doctor.  4/22/21 ? 2nd Shot at 10:35 am - @ 1:45 pm arm really started to get soar and hard to lift.  Chills. Drossy.   4/23/21 ? After I awoke from the 1st night, I couldn't move my entire body's left side, I was dragging my left leg with me and couldn't lift my arm from my body or move it. exhausted felt drugged, like hangover, migraine and getting in car accident all in one. Kept dozing off.  Slept a lot. Head felt similar to concussion. Unable to really walk.   4/24/21 ?Slept a lot during day.  Arm and leg mobility better and I could finally feel my left fingers. So much pain so I finally took my 1st Tylenol muscle 8 hr at 9:38 am. Took another at 10:30pm. It helped for about 5 hours and then woke up with sharp pains again. At night, shooting pains in legs especially back of legs and burning I?m in a lot of pain so while I can now feel my left side and move my arm a bit better my legs are still in a constant state of shooting spasm and I can?t lay down, sit up, recline or anything. Nothing brings comfort. It?s like taking an electrical prod to my body. Arm still hurts (NOT at injection site) but can move it better now still feels like sinus infection. It?s like muscles are pizza dough and someone is pulling them, stretching them painfully with electrical current when you aren?t moving. Massive spasm all over back of legs hips from bottom down. Eyes really swollen. Did Sinus Rinse. Under my arm put and beside/behind my breast rib cage sore.   4/26/21 - Pain wakes as usual throughout the night but it?s 4:40am and the Tylenol has worn off. Pizza dough pulling and spasms in the legs. I?ve taken more Tylenol in the last 4 days than I have taken in the last 40 years. I felt like I didn?t have a headache when I got up but my legs were still streaming so I took another Tylenol and I have a headache and don?t feel good. I now am able to move arm but extremely painful like a log, I can lift it only 1.5 inches from my body which is more than I could before so it must be getting better. Head still feels similar to concussion with migraine.  The headache is causing me to clinch teeth and the headache is not at the level it was but still pretty bad. None of this pre -2nd shot.  When I was about 12yrs old I had Rheumatoid arthritis (or that was the drs explanation) and this is what it felt like, I couldn?t move my legs or my arms then.  I did not take any Tylenol tonight.  Shoot pains only wake me up 3 times although they are constantly there just the strength differs Dr?s have always said I have extremely high threshold for pain. I was finally able to brush my hair, afterwards my arms were shaking muscle wise and fatigued. Rash inside my ear and face blotchy.   4/27/21 ?No real change in symptoms except now I am seeing my face swell and eyes are still burning and painful. My face only on the left side more than right looks like a cabbage patch doll- swelling.   Eyes sore and front of head hurts. Stuffy nostril only left one ? so I do another sinus rise today. Still feel drugged. Body is sore. Hard to move neck. Still in pain take Tylenol at 9:20pm.  The pain woke me up multiple times and kept me up. It?s like someone is pulling my muscles like pizza dough. It is so painful. No position is comfortable. Woke up at 10:30, 11:45, 12:15, 2:21, 3:52, 4:05 and that was it couldn?t get back to sleep because of this pain. Don?t have a foam roller here but maybe an olive oil bottle I could use in the same manger or a tennis ball. I have to do something I can?t take this pain.   4/28/21 ? 8:32 am having trouble lifting my arm, very heavy fingers numb fatigued like I just lifted something really heavy by myself. I was finally able to move arms enough to was the dishes.  Left side of face still swollen. Under my arm put and beside/behind my breast rib cage still sore. Finally, was able to take bath. Not hot because I didn?t want any more swelling.   4/29/21 ? Only woke up a couple of time and slept better so thought I would try to go for a walk outside today. My headache I thought was pretty much gone. I didn?t last more than 8 mins. I felt like I couldn?t stand, exhausted, not strong enough and needed to sit down.  My migraine is back and I feel nausea, not hungry, face is swollen still.   I have lymphedema and use my machine every night, but it?s almost like the shot increases inflammation all over my body, find the places that have been affected before and gets in there. I only drink water, no coffee, tea or juice and no alcohol since 3 days before my 1st shot and was planning to continue that until 2 months after my 2nd shot.",,,,,,,,,N,04/22/2021,04/22/2021,0,N/A I am not sure if i should go to doctor or if this is normal,OTH,,"Fluticasone Propionte Nasal Spray 50mg 1 puff per nostril per day, 1x day: Prenatal Multi + 200 mg DHA, 1400 mg/980mg Omega 3 Fish Oil, Magnesium 500mg, Evening Primrose oil 1,000mg, B2 100mg, Allegra 180 mg",None,"Lymphedema, had rheumatoid arthritis when I was 12. .  disc bad back, Staph infection &MRSA a couple of yrs ago they couldn't figure out above. 17 concussions.",,,2,04/29/2021,,,,"Penicillin, pineapple, scallops, dairy, eggs, seasonal and I carry epi pen since they could not figure out what i was allergic to 2 years ago when I had staph infection and they thought it was DVT's but then diagnosed me with lymphedema"

I informed the folks who were in the watch room that I felt I was having a negative reaction, and they immediately tended to me, putting an O2 sensor and BP cuff on. For the next 40 minutes, I experienced waves of dizziness and my heart was racing. My BP jumped around a bit, but never into dangerous areas. Breathing was never compromised. Staff required I lay down on a mat. I requested a Benadryl, having had a previous anaphylactic episode from an allergy shot when I was 13 and concerned this could be the onset of that. After about 30 minutes and benadryl the racing heart subsided, but I continued to have waves of dizziness overcome me. After about 40 minutes of laying down and heart rate no longer racing, I decided to try to walk to car to go home and rest. I was unable to walk, overcome again with dizziness and with legs that felt weighted, or rubbery. After another 10 minutes or so of sitting and waiting for waves of dizziness to stop, I decided to allow a nurse to wheel me upstairs to Urgent Care.   Urgent Care doc concluded that I was not experiencing life threatening symptoms and was likely being told by my body that I needed to rest. I agreed with this assessment. By the time I left Urgent Care, I had been experiencing waves of dizziness for 2 hours, and the heart racing that had accompanied it had stopped after I took Benadryl.

She did get the last dose and the tingling in her face, mouth, and extremities is continuing  to this day.  She saw her doc this morning and is on a list to see a neuro team in a few weeks with the hope the symptoms will resolve before then. Given my talk with her, I decided to take my symptoms seriously and called the vaccination line and they suggested I consult with my doc.

Dr. appt and said ear was good, might be a lymphnode but no infection. Thought maybe a tooth issue. Dentist said no. Fatigue progressed, with irritability and a dull pain started in left chest muscle but I thought it was from lifting weights. Then extreme itching in center of back, thought a spider bite? Couldn't see it. 24 hrs before my 2nd shot appt, asked son to look at my back. Small rash size of a quarter. Changing my shirt, I noticed two more quarter size rashes on side of left breast. Never any fever.  Uploaded photos and telemed dr confirmed shingles. Prescribed Valacyclovir for 7 days.  Was told it looked like a mild case.   First symptoms started 4/10/21, rash discovered 4/16/21 but probably started 4/13/21. No blisters developed. Back only itched but left breast pain grew worse to under arm and entire breast. But rash did not spread. Rash just starting to fade April 28, but pain still persists.  Dr. advised not to get 2nd shot until after antiviral med finished, but I am still waiting 2 more weeks and hope to get 2nd shot May 7th, before the 42 day window closes even if I still have pain.  I flew to get first shot as I was eligible there. I needed vaccine asap due to childcare and my Medicare business seeing over 65 population.
