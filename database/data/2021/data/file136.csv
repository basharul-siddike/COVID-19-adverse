Decadron was transitioned to IV Solumedrol, nebs were given and Spiriva was added to her home bronchodilators.  Throughout her stay, she was clinically stable but was unable to be completely weaned from oxygen.  By the day of discharge, Patient was eager to go home. She will need 2 L of oxygen at the time of discharge. She has transitioned to PO Prednisone and will continue a taper. Glucose levels were well controlled on insulin during admission.

Inadvertently mixed a Peds dose Pfizer vial formulated for 5-11 year olds. It was discovered before parent left as staff notice a vial of the Ped dose was open and she knew we were not yet using that vaccine. The only Peds doctor working at that time was Dr so she checked with provider to see if he had indeed ordered a Ped dose for someone. He said he did not, then stated he just ordered a regular Pfizer for a client. We then check with the nurse and inquired what vaccine vial was used to give the Pfizer she just had gave and where which container did she give it from. It was indeed the Ped dose. Dr. spoke with patient and parent. It was then decided that an additional dose of the Ped Pfizer vaccine would be given @ 0.2 ml It was discussed to check for possible additional information and deemed by provider to proceed ( A new separate vial was open and mixed as it was unknown at that particular time to which degree the previous vial was diluted) The additional dose was administered at 0.2 ml as requested by provider. The information for the additional dose was documented in the original order with explanation of what was given. Provider had stated there wasn't a separate order available at that time. Patient was held for an additional 15 minutes had no issues or complaints and released with parent. When the Pfizer Ped dosage was received the previous week, the vaccine coordinator, staff placed it in the Main fridge on a separate shelf from the regular Pfizer. It was kept in its original box and placed in a plastic bag marked as Ped Pfizer 5-11 years and was then tagged with a sticker as a visual method to make it stand out as different. It was also placed in a Blue bin marked with a sticker. The blue bin was also marked as Pfizer Ped 5-11 only, dosage 0.2 ml and the Diluent amount all written on bin. Regular Pfizer has always been kept in a green bin on the middle shelf of the unit. After intendent the Blue bin was removed from Main fridge and was relocated to the other fridge with a Note on it stating do not use. I also added two additional stickers 1 High Alert and 1 Look alike Sound alike stickers were placed on both Pfizer vaccine bins although now in different units I thought it maybe helpful being as proactive additional prevention till asses by those who investigate such matters as to what best method for storage should be.

Called the pharmacist and he thought it might be an allergic  reaction and advised that I go to the ER. The ER had a very long wait. After about another 30-45 minutes I noticed more time between waves of spasms. After being in the ER for about an hour and a half I noticed I was feeling better and was able to have a bowel movement.

She thought that she just had a strong immune system but then with the 3rd dose she had it in the morning and went to work and then before her shift had ended she had body aches and a headache as well. 24 hours afterwards her body aches went away but she has had a pretty severe headache/ migraine ever since and it has never gone away. It doesnt come and go, it has been there all day every day, and it is constant. It has been 6 weeks. The side effects after her 3rd dose started in less than 8 hours afterwards.  She did get her pneumonia shot that Monday before she got her COVID vaccine, confirmed to be on 13Sep2021. Her physician said that it was fine to do them that closely spaced and the caller didnt think that anything was wrong with. In this whole journey of trying to figure this out because she has has no history of having headaches or migraines, she ended up having a CT scan and then she also had 1 MRI that showed possible intracranial hypertension and then she had a 2nd MRI that was looking for blood clots, there wasnt any, but it also showed intracranial hypertension. She has no history of hypertension and she actually has to take medications to keep her blood pressure up. Inquired for further details on the medications that she has to take to keep her blood pressure up and she states that she has Addisons disease and takes hydrocortisone as well as fludrocortisone because it also helps keep her electrolytes in balance to help maintain her blood pressure, she started them both 20 years ago. Inquired for dates of the CT scan and the 2 MRIs and she states that her had her 2nd MRI she believes on 27Oct2021 and the 1st on 20Oct2021 and both showed the intracranial hypertension. Her 1st MRI was with and without contrast. Now she is waiting to see an eye doctor because they apparently can see it behind the eyes and she is going to do that in a week and a half and then she has to meet with a neurologist after that to maybe do an LP to drain spinal fluid to try to relieve the pressure in her brain. Inquired for results of her CT scan and she states that it didnt come back normal there were something about non specific changes but she needs to double check. The CT was without contrast and it says that there were scattered non-spatial subcortical in the bilateral frontal lobes greater than the expected age, nonspecific and then it also said there were early small vessel ischemic changes and vasculitis to include white mater changes consistent with migraines, but she has never had migraines in her entire life until 17Sep2021. In her mind these are all cute changes. She had her CT scan on 01Oct2021, Oct2021 was a very expensive month for her.",,,,,,,,,N,09/17/2021,09/17/2021,0,"Test Date: 20211001; Test Name: CT scan; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:there were scattered non-spatial subcortical in th; Comments: there were scattered non-spatial subcortical in the bilateral frontal lobes greater than the expected age, nonspecific and then it also said there were early small vessel ischemic changes and vasculitis to include white mater changes consistent with migraines.; Test Date: 20211020; Test Name: MRI; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:intracranial hypertension; Comments: 1st MRI was with and without contrast; Test Date: 20211027; Test Name: MRI; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:intracranial hypertension",UNK,,HYDROCORTISONE; FLUDROCORTISONE,Addison's disease,,,USPFIZER INC202101525033,2,11/18/2021,,,,

It is important to report association of disease exacerbation so that patients may undergo post vaccination monitoring. The authors hereby present a case of worsening IgA nephropathy temporarily associated with COVID vaccination. A 63-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, psoriatic arthritis presented to the hospital with gross hematuria for 6 weeks starting 3 days after 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Her PCP had sent her to ER 5 days after onset of hematuria as had noted a creatinine (Cr) of 1.6 with 3+ protein and greater than 20 RBCs on urinalysis suspicious for nephritic syndrome. On review she had serum Cr of 0.5 about 4 months ago with no proteinuria or hematuria before. In the ER she was given antibiotics for urinary tract infection and outpatient referral for nephrology. She could not make the outpatient appointment and with continued gross hematuria for a month, she presented to the ER again where she was noted to have Cr of 10 mg/dl and urine protein:cr ratio of 7.3gm/gm. Renal imaging including CT urogram was normal. Renal biopsy showed IgA nephropathy, M1S0E0T1C1 with a fibrocellular crescent and acute tubular necrosis likely secondary to lyzed red cells in setting of multiple RBC casts in the tubules. She was put on 250 mg Solumedrol for 3 doses followed by 1 mg/kg of Prednisone with eventual downtrend in Cr to 4.5 in 15 days.  There have been 2 cases reported in literature with known IgA nephropathy who developed gross hematuria post COVID 19 vaccination. SARS- COV 2 vaccines use nucleoside modified purified mRNA which does elicit higher neutralizing antibody titre and strong cluster of differentiation response leading to production of several proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, there is a concern that vaccines might exacerbate immune mediated glomerular diseases. IgA1 is involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy and patients with IgA nephropathy have higher than normal IgA1 response to other vaccines like influenza. Also while studying the antibody response to COVID 19 illness patients with IgA nephropathy are known to express higher IgA response compared to IgG and IgM along with reports of concurrent worsening of the glomerulonephritis. Nephrologists should closely follow patients with IgA nephropathy to establish the frequency of disease activation post vaccination.

I did not take my temperature because I felt too sick to look for the thermometer. I took 2 ibuprofin but it didn't help. Symptoms lessened over the next 12 hours but did not go away for 2 days. After that, I  felt foggy and unfocused. For weeks I noticed a  marked increase of incidents where I could not rem- ember famillar words.    (see next page) For example, I tried to say to my husband while out  on a walk "" Look at that birdhouse,"" but I could not remember the word "" birdhouse"" I tried to call it "" birdbox"" and "" birdhome."" This was 3 weeks after my shot. I also had several occasions while driving, of suddenly not knowing where I was for several moments, before finally realizing I was actually on a familiar route- in broad daylight. This happened rarely in the past and only at night. It is over 7 months later and I am still having these incidents of forgetting familiar information. This rarely happened to me before I got COVID vaccine. I do not want to get any more COVID 19 shots. I fear they may cause me to become unable to work because I may forget all the many details I need to remember to do my job as a personal care aide for 2 clients-",,,,,,,,Y,N,03/31/2021,04/01/2021,1,I did not have health insurance at  the time.,PHM,,"(no medications) multi-vit, iron,fish oil, spiruling, diatomaceous iearth(sillca), D3200, lecithin, zinc",None,"Suspected Gilberts Syndrome, sensitivity to  wireless emissions.",,,2,11/01/2021,,,,"msg, gluten, steroids, oral penicillin."
1884714,11/19/2021,MD,87.0,87,,F,,"I tried to fill out the form on the computer, and it got to my age and froze and would no longer let me type anything on the form. In case you think I'm to old, my grandmother lived to 102 and her father lived to the age of 97. I've also outlived my mother by many years who was a smoker. I never smoked. Since the adverse problems, my cursive that I always rewarded me with complements has really gone bad and my printing is not much better. Shortly after I got the first dose of vaccine (Moderna) around 28 February or the first or second week of March, both in 2021, I started to awaken about 4am with horrible pain in my legs, side and all over my lower body. I've made an appointment with my orthopedic doctor thinking my knees needed draining, but he wisely sent me to get an MRI of the back. Mind you, I always took the first appointment offered, so I was not able to get the MRI until March 24, 2021. Doct  appointment on April 29, 2021 have me a cortisone injection at Surgery Center, and at least it helped my awakening at 4am. Then, however, I started to fall (8 times total) and I was not dizzy nor did I black out - I just fell.   So, the falls happened between March 19, 2021 and June 17, 2021. The eighth occurred around September, 2021 (I did not record the date) on my deck many weeks later after weeks of physical therapy (two times a week) until I went in for a left eye cataract surgery which was postponed during Covid 19, and that was done on September 21, 2021. While my blood pressure was always controlled by medication, it now is out of sight all the time and is partially controlled by telmisartan 80 mg, (everyday), Indapamide 1.25 mg (a water ill) 4 times a week, and 81 mg aspirin 3 times a week, and Simvastatin 10 mg every night. All my medicines, allergies, and surgues are enclosed on a separate sheet. I am the beneficiary and wife of a retired spouse.   I have had two MRI (back and brain), two CT scans (brain and sinus), EMG, VNG, two carotid artery exams and I say sinus because the one on the brain which was to show any bleeding, showed no blood, and neither did an MRI, but it showed a sinus infection which was worse on the MRI. I was having no symptoms except my nose ran 24/7 and nose drops stopped that. So, Doctor (the ENT doctor) ordered the VNG to see if it showed any balance issues but nothing showed any by that time the sinus infection could not be detected any longer. I also had lab work done at Medical Center and one other place I cannot now remember, but nothing was reported to me as unusual. The EMG ruled out Parkinson's Disease and Neuropathy.  I went from walking to having a walker and cane on each floor of my home in a manner of weeks. I now walk funny with small steps. I had to but new mattresses because the others were too high (also new) and I fell off the high one. I am fearful of stepping off a curve and I still have gait problems as I just saw Doctor (Neurologist) November 4, 2021 and had my second arterial duplex on November 5, 2021 (Cardiologist). I've slowed down a lot and it takes me a long time to dress and do things. My legs are very weak and I'm fearful of stepping down a curb on uneven pavement because it is difficult for me. Sometimes I feel very uncoordinated. I use car straps getting into and out of cars. A lot of my symptoms mimic Guillain-Barre, but by the time I was tested weeks had gone by, so no one can be positive, by they all say there is a strong possibility. Afterall, when I go the Monderna vaccine I never expected there to be a problem. However, my balance is still off so when you ask if it is a disability or permanent damage, at this point, I don't know because I still have gait problems and weak legs. There were three other patients who have the same symptoms as mine in just the one practice. And recently, I learned of a niece who is much younger and after getting antibodies intravenously (she had Covid) she experienced symptoms similar to mind. I don't know the ages of those three, or what they did about it, but I very much fear the booster vaccine now. I sometimes go to urinate and I can't and I have difficulty washing the bottom of my right foot or putting on pants on my right leg especially. There is a dent in the middle of my forehead that was not there before I got the vaccine and it was not there even after hitting my head when I fell. When speaking in sentences, I forget what I am going to say- but I usually think of it later. The dent just appeared one day. On advice book I read during COVID-19 told me to keep track of every medical visit. Best advice I ever read.   Problems and Surgeries  High Blood Pressure, Joint Pain in Back, fluid fills knees periodically and must be drained, basal & squamous cell carcinoma on skin especially face. Knees ongoing in 2021 - BP especially 2021.  2 Mitchell Bunionectomies - one around 1977 and one in the late seventies or early 80's by doctor who is retired.  Ethmold sinus operation - Aug. 1992.  Six Cortisone Injections in Back in the 70's or 80's - Pain in Back unbearable- Was sent to Physical Therapy after first three Injections and it brought me back to square one where I needed 3 more Injections. Doctor gave the the shots and he died in a motorcycle accident. After six Injections I was ok for a long time.  Two Moh's surgery on nose by two different doctors.  Knees drained periodically and cortisone injected into the knees - Doctor 2021-and before.  March 24, 2021- Before this date kept waking up around 4am with such pain in legs. On this date doctor ordered an MRI on back.

Successful and no pain for several years.  On April 14, 2021 Doctor said my kidneys were normal but she sent me to doctor who agreed. After seeing him, he called me and put me on an antibiotic because I had an UTI, but said my blood pressure was not good. I went to see a Blood Pressure Specialist, a cardiologist. I'm allergic to almost all categories of blood pressure medications now to include a new nitrate med (headache and general malaise) though I am on telmisartan - which is sometimes good and sometimes bad.  March 24, 2021 - Before this date kept waking up around 4am with such pain in legs. Doctor ordered an MRI on back (which was performed on this date) which resulted in my getting a cortisone injections.  Cortisone Shot in back - April 29, 2021 Doctor - Surgery Center It ceased my being awaked but sometimes my legs and buttocks hurt until I have my morning coffee - pain is bearable throughout the day. Since March 19, 2021 I have fallen 8 times in March, April, 3 times in May, twice in June and once on the deck going into the house either in September or October (I did not write it down). I am neither dizzy or disoriented - I just fall and mostly towards my right side. Also, the last one in the house was bloody as my forehead near the brow line was cut and the blood dripped into my eyes. My husband usually has to come down from upstairs to lift me up because I cannot do it myself.  In July when I saw the neurologist I was filled with terrible anxiety and she suggested I call a psychiatrist. I was on two different beta-blockers at two different times, and finally ended up with Bystolic (a newer one). I sometimes stayed awake for 24 hours. I needed sleep and stopped taking the beta-blocker where the valsartan at the time made me feel horrible. I called Pharmacy and asked if beta-blockers were made with dye. She went to check and came back saying yes. That's when I stopped Bystolic and I am like a different person - no more anxiety.  On August 17 of 2021 I went to Physical Therapy twice a week and my Physical Therapist - I stopped for Cataract Surgery.  Left Eye Cataract Surgery - September 21, 2021 - Doctor Surgery Center.  Skin Cancer Body check every six months.  VGN Ordered by Doctor on Oct. 5, 2021 and performed Oct. 20, 2021 at the Neurology Office. Showed minor stuff related to age.  My daughter took me to see Doctor, September 13, 2021 a Uro-Gynecologist, because she thinks my getting up so many times during the night to urinate disrupts my sleep. I had a urine test and was given a ""Foods to Avoid"" list and I am to consider getting injections. Must call to see if they are talking about Botox as I don't believe I want Botox and they had mentioned it on a prior visit, but not they just say injections. I also should follow a low oxalate diet because of my kidney stone.  After pain in my legs and falling - I have had two cat scans of head to check for bleeding *there was none) but it did show a minor sinus infection, and also, two MRIs, one of the back and August 11, 2021, one of the brain, which showed the sinus infection got worse. The second cat scan showed that sinus infection getting better. I have used a nose rinse given to me by doctor. An EMG July 27, 2021 said no neuropathy and no Parkinson's though I do tremble. It was rather late to show Guillain-Barre Syndrome, but I took the appointments as they came available and I never expected a problem after getting the vaccine. I also had a carotid artery test July 28. 2021, and an arterial duplex November 5, 2021. The renal duplex did not show any blockages. The carotid doppler showed no significant blockages as well.",,,,,,,,Y,,02/16/2021,02/20/2021,4,,SCH,,"Telmisartan 80 MG 1 tablet orally once a day Simvastatin -10 MG- 1 time a day at bedtime Indapamide - 1.25 MG- four times a week -If I take 7 days, I become ill Aspirin 81 MG 1 tablet 3 x a week - Causes body to bruise horribly Prebiotic/Pr",Most BP Meds-Dye in meds + Food.

He was hypotensive and unstable at the time of presentation. He was taken for an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a right colectomy and small bowel resection. During the case, he had increasing pressor requirements and worsening hypotension. Decision was made to transfer to the SICU and leave the patient in discontinuity with an abthera for temporary closure.    Patient was therefore transferred to the SICU. He was started on multiple pressors including norepinephrine, vasopressin, and epinephrine to maintain his blood pressure. Despite these interventions, he continued to be unstable. Family made the decision to make him DNR/DNI, however with continued aggressive care and interventions on 11/14. He continued to be on the ventilator with progressively increasing pressor requirements. On the morning of 11/15, family made the decision to transition to comfort care measures. Propofol was stopped, and pressors were stopped shortly after. Family desired extubation and patient was extubated at 0625.

1885055,11/19/2021,DC,52.0,52,,M,,"Three weeks after my initial shot (late March 2021), I started to experience vertigo and a thrumming, vibrating sensation in my ears. The vertigo is not the room spinning-type but a bobbing up and down and side to side sensation as if one is on a boat. I continued with my 2nd vaccine shot the following week. The symptoms continue to this day, 7.5 months after my first vaccine shot. None of these symptoms existed prior to receiving the vaccine. Initially, I reached out to my GP in late April 2021 My GP ordered a complete blood work-up and suggested I schedule a visit to an ENT. All of the blood work came back normal. I saw an ENT in May 2021. The ENT initially prescribed a 10-day prednisone treatment along with a 30-day treatment of fluticasone.  Neither resolved the issue. The ENT then referred me to an audiologist who conducted a series of vestibular tests, all of which returned normal results. The tests done in July 2021. The ENT then recommended vestibular therapy. After 3 sessions the therapist terminated my therapy as she was unable to reproduce the symptoms based on the tests available to her. The therapy occurred in late August and early September 2021. In late August 2021, I visited my GP again for further guidance. Another round of blood work was ordered. My GP did notice that my left sinuses were clogged and prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics and a 5-day course of prednisone. None of these resolved the vertigo or the thrumming sensation in my ears. All blood work came back normal.

Went to urgent care finally and they just told me to keep following what Google recommended, didn't like that response so went to urgent care in the town over from me, they took labs and prescribed me a water pill (can't remember name just know it started with an ""F"").

Primary survey completed.  Airway pain.  Breath sounds equal and clear.  Heart regular rate rhythm with 2+ peripheral pulses.  GCS 14 due to confusion.  Patient was fully exposed and no identifiable traumatic injury seen.  Given mechanism injury he was maintained in his cervical collar.  CT imaging head and cervical spine also ordered along with lab work, EKG, and urinalysis. EKG showed atrial fibrillation is rate controlled at 69 with occasional ventricular paced rhythm.  No acute ischemic change seen or change when compared to prior EKG. Pacemaker was also interrogated due to the son's concern regarding potential bradycardia causing his fall.  There is no evidence of bradycardia with lowest heart rate being greater than 60. The patient's son and daughter arrived the emergency department and confirmed he is at his baseline mentation.  CT imaging reviewed showed no traumatic injury.  Lab work and urinalysis were reassuring.  Was able to clear cervical collar in no pain in the neck with palpation or range of motion.

The temperature was only above 50.5 on Wednesday for about 3 hours and 2 minutes. No vials from the fridge were administered.  I reached out to both Janssen and Pfizer manufacturers and talked to their excursion team and their safety team to relay patient information. Regarding the Janssen doses administered, the documentation provided to me and relayed over the phone from Janssen was thus: ?47F to 50 F ? No restriction in duration if the product is not expired. For 51F to 77F ? Up to 12 hours (cumulative) if the product is not expired?. Our product is not expired and did not meet the ?Up to 12 hours cumulative? when we administered the vaccines. No further steps were taken to reach out to patients. We will dispose of the vaccines we have left in the fridge.   Regarding Pfizer, I submitted a report to their excursion team as well as submitted patient information to their safety team. I received an email stating they had no data regarding stability for the vaccine for the temperature excursion I reported and was directed to call the CDC. I called the CDC, but they said I would need to receive specific information about what to do for patients administered the vaccine from the manufacturer. The CDC also asked me to submit a VAERS report and to receive more information for the patients from VAERS.

At the time I thought is was normal as from what I have read. It went away in a few hours. Two weeks later I went to get my second shot and they wouldn't administer as I told them what my reaction was.   July 23, I experienced a very sharp stabbing-like sensation in my heart region. I was not able to breathe as well. We called emergency call they came in did an EKG, and said everything looked OK. After some time the sensation went away, but we still decided to go to ER and see what was that horrible feeling. ER ran a full blood test along with chest xrays and Troponin istat. They said that there no no sign of a heart attack. The next day I was not able to walk at all. I simply could breathe normally. Sharp stabbing pinching pain in my heart region would not go away. I made an appt with my physician. He was told me that he thinks I have MYOCARDITIS inflammation of the heart and referred me to go see a cardiologist. It took me a long time to make an appt with a cardiologist. at this point its been over 2 months. i could not walk for no more than 20 min before I had to completely stop and nothing was going away. The doctor told me we need to do 3 tests to rule out Myocarditis. ECHO, STRESS TEST, AND HOLTER. after those tests were done the doctor couldn't catch anything so he suggested a 4 test TELEMETRY monitor a device I have connected to me for 7 days and I would press the button when symptoms arise.

I tried to get rid of the pain by walking it off and scratching my leg, but the more I walked, the worse it got. I don't like taking a lot of medicines, so I took 81mg of aspirin. I waited and the pain eased a bit. I also had hot ginger tea with lemon and honey and hoped it would help me relax a bit. I then prepared dinner and later went to bed. I woke up at about 3:00-3:30AM on 4/15/2021 to go to the bathroom and noticed the pain was returning, so I took a hot shower and hoped it would help the muscles relax. I then went back to bed and woke up at 8:30AM. I went to get breakfast and noticed the pain had returned and was even worse than it had been at 3:00AM, so I took some more aspirin. The pain eased a bit and I was able to go on with my day. On 4/16/2021, the pain returned and was so bad that I could hardly walk. I tried to find someone to take me to the ER, but I couldn't find anyone, so I made do by taking aspirin every 6-8 hours to help ease the pain. On 4/17/2021, my sister called me and asked if I was still in pain. I told her I was, so she took me to the ER at Memorial Hospital. The ER staff told me I had probably pulled or injured a muscle, though I hadn't done anything to injure my leg. They wrapped my leg in a tight bandage and advised me to rest and to try to refrain from using my leg as much as possible. However, I found that the bandage made the pain worse, so I removed the bandaged and tried elevating my leg. Over the following 2 weeks, I continued to experience leg pain and swelling. On 4/30/2021, I went to Health for an upper endoscopy. They noticed my leg was swollen and asked if I was in pain, and I told them I was. They decided not to perform the endoscopy and had me wheeled over to the ER. At the ER, I underwent tests, and they found a blood clot. I was promptly given Eliquis and was kept until about 5:00 PM, so they could monitor me and ensure the medicine was working. They gave me a week's supply of Eliquis and told me to go to my PCP to get another prescription for Eliquis when I ran out. I tried to get in to see my regular PCP, but he was booked solid, so I switched to another doctor, who has been following my case ever since.

Did not take anything that day (may have had some tea). Next day slight increase in symptoms. Took acid-indigestion medicine early afternoon followed by muscle relaxant followed by one (1) Aleve Muscle and Back pain tablet (these were all taken hours apart). Note: I work from home; shift ends at 2am. Symptoms did not subside but increased by that evening. By end of shift, was experiencing intense pain in chest area that hurt whether sitting, standing, bending over, laying down or moving. included shortness of breath. Tried to sleep and eventually got up around 7am on 6/9/21 and decided to go to nearest ER. Managed to get dressed and took Uber to ER. Was admitted to ER as soon as I arrived. Received ECG, blood pressure test, chest x-ray, covid test, chest MRI scan (w/ and w/o contrast), ultra sound of the legs, TTC w/ doppler and color, and various blood tests. The testing revealed the small blood clot in my right lung. Was admitted into the hospital and given Eliquis (oral, tablets) for that day and next and prescribed prescription for initially one month. I informed my cardiologist, my primary doctor and  neurologist of what was happening. Was eventually given a prescription by primary doctor for three (3) month supply of Eliquis and referral to hematologist by attending physician at ER and cardiologist to find out if I was susceptible to blood clots as there is not a known history of this in my family. Returned to the ER two times afterwards (6/18 - not admitted and 6/23 - admitted) for additional pain and shortness of breath. Was given an ECG, blood tests, blood pressure test, chest x-rays for both. Was given a chest CAT scan on the 6/23 visit. It was discovered during this visit that the blood clot had dissolved. On 6/24, was given a stress test by my cardiologist (he is affiliated with this hospital). Passed. Saw Hematologist in 8/2021; returned for results on 9/13/21. No propensity was found for blood clots. Conclusion - clot resulted from vaccine. Informed that I could stop taking Eliquis at end of month.  I did return to the ER just recently (11/10/21) due to the same/similar symptoms that I experienced back in June 2021 (heaviness in chest area).

She was admitted for ongoing care as she remained hypotensive requiring norepinephrine.   With remote teratoma 2015 s/p resection and no e/o recurrence I wonder if her COVID (and/or influenza) vaccinations reactivated a senescent paraneoplastic syndrome. Her prodromal headache, fever and dysautonomia have now been complicated by two prolonged episodes of anxiety, agitation, psychosis, dyskinesias, diminished language output and echolalia which are concerning for an encephalitis like picture. Her dramatic improvement after high dose lorazepam with complete normalization of neuropsychiatric symptoms but not all autonomic symptoms is puzzling. Her symptoms are not typical for anxiety attacks. She was responsive enough during the episodes to argue strongly against generalized seizures. CT abd/pelvis did not show recurrent mass.

On second visit host parent was informed what happened and that pfizer would need to be given to complete series instead of Moderna. They understood and were fine with that. Host parent was also asked if the child experienced any side effects from the dose of moderna and none had been noted. Host parent was very kind and understanding.

His post-HCT course was complicated by acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) of the skin, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and liver requiring intensified immunosuppression with tacrolimus, itacitinib, and prednisone. After clinical resolution of GVHD, all iatrogenic immunosuppression was discontinued on day +1335. Nine days post vaccination, he presented to the Hematology and Oncology Clinic with fevers up to 40�C (104�F), sore throat, nonproductive cough, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Twelve days post vaccination, he returned to the Hematology and Oncology Clinic after an asymptomatic, faint pink, maculopapular rash developed on his face and spread to his torso and upper extremities. He did not have conjunctivitis or coryza. He denied any recent measles exposures, sick contacts, or international travel. After consultation with Transplant Infectious Diseases, Clinical Epidemiology and Infection Prevention, and the Public Health, a diagnostic evaluation for vaccine-derived measles (Measles post vaccine) was performed. Serum measles immunoglobulin M antibody was positive and immunoglobulin G antibody was negative. Measles RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in urine and throat specimens. Viral genotyping by sequence analysis confirmed the strain to be genotype A (vaccine-derived) measles. He received a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 400 mg/kg. His symptoms resolved without sequelae. Despite his attendance at the Hematology and Oncology Clinic where other vulnerable individuals with solid tumor malignancies, hematologic malignancies, and HCT recipients were also present, no secondary cases occurred.

Sharp pains in back of head.  Stopped taking vistaril  10/2 - struggled through day with heart issues and body spasms; left hand/eye pretty constant, but differ in severity.  Woke up again at night with spasms/head pressure/ pain  10/3 - called to see about going to hospital; went to urgent care.  Dr. wants all this reported to vaccine registry; thinks having an autoimmune reaction. Didn?t think Guillain Barre at this point.  Echo scheduled for 10/19  The next week - same issues waxing and waning.  Heart issues much more subdued.  Spasms migrated to right side of body (last about 10-15 min in other areas); feet/hands/arms/eyes, but most severe on left side.  The above issues waxed and waned for a solid month after getting vaccine before really starting to subdue.

I'm also describing some post-acute symptoms I've experienced. To be clear, I do not associate any of these symptoms with my vaccination itself.]  On September 21, I received a positive test result for COVID-19. I was experiencing a fever, loss of smell, cough, and congestion, which prompted me to get tested. During my isolation period I treated symptoms with DayQuil and ibuprofen. On the 25th, most symptoms were resolved, but I experienced some slightly difficult breathing (not wheezing, but the feeling of ""incomplete"" breaths) and chest/intercostal muscle tightness. This was accompanied by notable feelings of anxiety/worry. I was examined by EMTs at my home, who noted normal blood oxygen levels and blood pressure. They advised my breathing seemed within norms, and not the ""shortness of breath"" that would indicate a severe problem (since I was able to speak without interruption). On the 27th I spoke with a provider at my PCP's office, who agreed that I was not at high risk, but prescribed an albuterol inhaler to be used as needed. This appeared to help, although the mental/emotional symptoms were still somewhat present.  Around October 30/31 I started to notice similar muscle tightness and ""incomplete"" breaths, provoking a significant anxiety response again. I did my best to self-manage with the albuterol, muscle stretching, and meditation. On November 1 I was seen by an urgent care center, with a follow-up chest x-ray on November 3. The x-ray was described to me as ""normal, with some bronchitis"" and I was advised to continue using the albuterol. I spoke with my PCP, on November 8, who recommended I switch from the albuterol to Flovent (fluticasone) since albuterol can increase heart rate and perceived anxiety. I've been on that course since November 13, and the symptoms seem to be well-managed so far.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/28/2021,09/21/2021,146,"21 September 2021: positive result for COVID-19 (Qualitative NAAT) 3 November 2021: CBC (all results normal), chest X-ray (detailed results not available to me)  I didn't see another place to provide this information: my first vaccination dose was on 04/29/2021 and my second was on 05/19/2021",PUB,,"Daily: Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir (TDF) 200-300 mg), valacyclovir (500 mg), vitamin D supplement",None,None,,,2,11/20/2021,,Y,Y,Clindamycin (mild -- rash)

1888734,11/21/2021,AL,28.0,28,,F,,"Day of inoculation: [I note that the nurse didn't pull before injecting] Afternoon: heavy drowsiness and tiredness, arm soreness, no redness. Evening: fever (<40C), chills, worst malaise of my life, trembling, weakness, muscle aches all over the body, exhaustion, confusion, sleep disturbance, agitation. Frecuent urination. This lasted until day 3 post inoculation. There were feelings of depression in April in the morning, with oral temperature measurements slightly below 36 C, which I had never seen before (I take my oral temperature regularly: it goes from 36.4-5, to 37.5) even after mild exercise on a rebounder. This lasted a few (at least 3) days, then the morning low temperature disappeared.  On june 1 I wrote to my therapist about my pain on my forearms. I had been trying to hang in there with it, but now it was very frequent, and I used lidocaine cream that day. I was waking up tired and on pain often, with diffuse, mild body aches, and depression. I often felt a need to stretch in the morning, for my muscles (particularly my legs) felt stiff. On july 4 I woke up with strong diffuse body aches. I wanted to rush to the doctor, but realized I couldn't drive in such pain. It was Sunday. After about 1-2 hours the pain mostly subsided. I drove to an Urgent Care. My blood pressure was 144, over what I don't remember. My usual systolic is 120-125. We talked about my PTSD, aches and feelings of depression. He prescribed cyclobenzaprine 5mg, orally, every night. I asked for my blood pressure to be taken again. Now it was 158, over 91, I think (using a manual pump this time). I take the medication that night, the next day I feel much better, and my blood pressure was back to normal. July 25 I am emotionally unstable (from being well to sadness), with chest aches, frequent dissociation (depersonalization and derealization, but never sensory flashbacks), and sudden changes in energy levels, which I blame on having been recently triggered and hormonal changes. I have increasing trouble speaking, which I also blame on anxiety, despite it being far more than usual. At some point I go to health center, where it is dismissed as psychogenic. During august I keep waking up very tired, and now speech difficulties make fluent conversation practically impossible for most of my waking time: I know what I want to say, I understand language, I can read and write, but I cannot get my muscles to respond, or to respond at reasonable speeds. This starts happening to me for a couple of days after getting triggered (which didn't use to be that way) and then the problem kept showing up even when triggers were not involved. I get a sore throat, at take a picture of it. It is just reddened. I go to Health center, and request to be referred to a speech pathologist (the person, sadly, has been unreachable ever since). September: by mid september I am still waking up with stiff muscles, sore legs, feeling tired, and by september 14 (a few days after, I notice, I had several almost non-painful sores in my throat, which then disappeared before the other symptoms showed up) I am woken up numerous times by leg movements that involve dosiflexion of one of my feet at a time (usually my left), extension of the toes, fanning of the toes, and varying degrees of flexion of the knee, sometimes to the point of raising the leg to the height of the abdomen. This may happen 10 times a night. I start to feel scared. I try cyclobenzaprine 5mg for one night. It doesn't make a difference. Almost two weeks in I decide to try to find explanations for the phenomenon. At this point, I am experiencing trembling when I genuflect or kneel at church (a daily activity for years now), I need to use my hand to help myself get up, I still have trouble speaking early in the morning and late at night, and often forget words. I have trouble bringing my laundry basket up the steps i have to: my arms won't respond enough to attempt to raise the basket, even though  I can otherwise move them normally. I end up using my fingers as hooks and going up the steps walking backwards pushing with my legs. I lose the ability to put the recliner of the pew back into place with a flick of my foot as always, even though I can put it down (I don't have a vieo of the event, I think, but I did record a video later of what that motion is supposed to be like). By october 15 I had discovered the human plantar foot reflex, and tested mine following the example of doctors in social media repeatedly. The result was dorsiflexion of the foot, with raising of the big toe, fanning of the other toes, and flexion of the knee on my left leg, no response on my right leg. I have a video about that. It kept holding true on different days, using different objects to elicit the response. I also tried other ""equivalent"" reflex tests, with same results. I get reffered to a neurologist. Lowering my room temperature helps reduce the frequency of the episodes. I get a referral to a neurologist. About a week later, I accidentally discover something: upon stretching my neck diagonally as far as I can and looking forward again, my teeth chatter. This stops after I push my chin on my chest. It hapens bilaterally, and it is consistently repeatable. I update my doctor about it. I am terrified.  At this point my legs are often feeling sore, particularly my thigh (frontal part). I speak to my parish priest. He gievs me the annointment of the sick. My anxiety got muh better. I start taking a multivitamin for women that doesn't contain iron, looking for a good source of B vitamins. Over the next week, gradually, I had better nights, and symptom improvement, but the Babinski was still there, the leg contractions at night were still there (just not usually wasking me up after my bedroom temperature was moved from 74 to 70F) , an with that my leg trembling has disappeared. My attempt to perform the Romberg test resulted in lack of balance becoming evident. I spoke to a friend doctor, who asked me to stand on one leg. I would stand on my right leg properly, but not on my left (lose balance). OCtober:  I have been having  tender spots all over my body. I take pictures of my touching the sponts that hurt. I also have a mouth sore in my upper lip (picture taken). Sometime I went to urgent care and was told it was probably because I was sleeping so poorly. I was prescribed antidepressants, but I dnd't take them, because I wasn't feelng depressed, and I didn't want meds that carry suicide  thought risk. I also drew and took a picture of the drwaing representing painful areas My neurologist appointment came on nove 17. She reported to not having read my history because she couldn't understand my GPs handwriting. She repeated the Romberg test, my capacity to walk with one foot in foront of the other, both resulted with me losing balance. She looked for something in my eye, but said nothing.  She tested several of my deep tendon reflexes, without any reported findings. She asked me to run my heel pver my shins: that resulted in no respnse on my right leg, but in dorsiflexion of the foot and raising of the big toe and fanning of the toes in my left foot. The same when I asked her to test for a Babinski sign. She ordered a B12 measurement, a thyroid hormone measurement, and a ferriting measurement. My ferritin level was 4.4 (4 something, that's for sure), if I remember correctly, and I was avised to talk to my GP bout iron supplementation or infusions. I started taking 65mg of iron a day since the day after the appointment. All else was great. Since that very night my legs have been awakening me again (particularly my left) with the same moveements as before. I demonstrated the chatter to a psichatric nurse yesterday )I was volunteering for something), and this time the chattering didn't stop through the usual mechanisms. I have a recording of the chatttering the day I went to the neurologist and of yesterday. This time the chattering lasted more than 5 minutes. After it didn't stop the suual way, Ithe nurse recommended that I should record it, and so I did, for more than 5 minutes. The chattering didn't end by the end of the vieo, but it did stop eventually, maybe within 10 minutes of the start. This had never happened befor I also recor mysef eating during the episode, and speaking. The phenomenon doesn't make itdifficult to eat, or swallow, and is not painful. It doesn't feel like the chattering from cold, and can happen at any temperature. I haven't been successful at trying to trigger it while lying down. I can make it stop by tensing some different muscles, but it comes back if I relax my jaw during an episode. I noticed in the video that, even whenI stop it like this, my face doesn't look quite right. I also noticed that I blinked a lot, but I don't remember if the wind was causing that. It did make it difficul for me to speak at some point, which is evidenced in the video. The mechanisms that I used and work for me when I am having difficulty speaking due to anxiety had absolutely no effect in this case. I may note that the leg movements aren't only present while I sleep, but also when I am close to falling asleep. Also, that sometimes (occassionally) they involve a rather circular motion of the foot, resulting in the foot ""climbimg"" up the bed, flesing upwards, thento the left, then downard as if rgoing back to the neutral position, releatedly and wuickly in a successive motion about three times or two.. Also that the contractions last a few seconds. I don't feel that I have any control over the foot during those moments. Another note, which I don't know how relevant it may be, is that I shiver very strongly:my whole back sways, my butt moves widely, my head goes out of position, and I have never seen anyone shiver like that. It hasn't always been this way, but I don't remember how long this has been. My doctor, listed here, I think, was not at the Health center when I had the severe and almost constant difficulty speaking. My academic advisor has seen it. A lot of the content of this long text has been based, not only on memory, but on writings that I directed to my therapist or friends reporting to her what was going on soon after the events took place, so when dates are stated or numbers are given they are accurate unless doubt is expressed, to  the best of my ability. I would be happy to make the videos available to you, also, if you may find them to be of help. I also had some headaches during october, but don't remember the dates. They were migraine-like, but not very intense 9except, sometimes, for a few seconds), no nausea or dizziness, or fainting, or loss of consciousness.. At some point, on a few days, I also tried using the rebounder to try to regain a bit of balance and muscle strength. I am a female, virgin, no contraceptives ever, no smoker nor do I consume any other drug, except as described, I am 5'3"", 157 pounds by now (my weight has been increasing, but not suspisciously quickly).

I could not stand up. I wasn?t nauseous. When I went to stand up, it felt like a huge weight and I had to sit down because I thought I might pass out. I texted my neighbor help because I couldn?t get out of bed. She came over the brought me my blood sugar testing and my blood sugar was 455. So now I know why I can?t move. So I had to inject with insulin and ended up throwing up. Took me about 6 hours to be able to move and then it took me 3 days to get my blood sugar within normal range. I also had break through bleeding which was like a mini period. Threw my blood sugar to high. I couldn?t tell after if the vaccine was the reason for throwing up, etc. If I couldn?t get the blood sugars down, we?d have to go to the doctor. But we managed to get that down. A week later, I was freezing cold and I still had spotting. So I went to the doctor and they did some tests and they said that it was just the aftermath. So I took Tylenol and it passed in 3-4 days. Then in May, I had an inability to swallow or eat. I don?t know if that was an outcome, but I?ve never had any problems before and nothing changed in my diet. Between Dec2020 ? Aug2021 I?ve lost 34 lbs.

1888799,11/21/2021,WA,40.0,40,,F,,"FIRST DOSE: Woke up following morning with sudden hearing loss. Left ear nearly no hearing at all present, Right ear only able to hear some sounds. Both ears unable to hear running water such as a faucet turned on and washing hands, unable to hear sausage sizzling in a hot pan when standing directly in front of hot pan, unable to hear swishing sounds of items being rubbed together or people walking near by. Unable to hear the sounds similar to the sound the letters ""s"" and ""f"" make.  VERY LOUD ringing in ears both left and right, Left more frequently.  Changes in hearing was never an issue prior to vaccination. It comes and goes and lasts all day/ night sometimes for multiple days at a time before it settles down. Once settled it comes back on very suddenly without warning or trigger. Almost as if its being turned on and off again by a switch or button. This causes great frustration, anxiety and uncertainty of surroundings due to sudden lack of hearing.   SECOND DOSE: Upon getting the 2nd dose no reactions until approximately 14 hours afterward. Expecting to feel flu-like symptoms and expecting the need to rest at the first signs of feeling not well, I laid back down to rest about an hour after waking up from a full night of rest. This was day 1 and included much of expected flu-like symptoms: chills, hot spells, desire to sleep, able to keep fluids in but not interested in eating food.  Day 2: Included all of symptoms from day 1 but more severe. Also included uncontrollable muscular spasms almost like convulsing. Unable to walk upright but able to crawl on all four to get to the bathroom and back to bed. Crying in severe pain and unable to get any rest due to the uncontrollable body movements. By about 4pm of dealing with excruciating pains, chills, sweats, migraine feeling headache. Unable to eat but able to keep in very small sips of Gatorade. Took an adult dose of NyQuil Severe, able to rest eyes for about an hour even while arms and leg muscles continuing to convulse involuntarily. Declined going to hospital and declined ambulance call.  Day 3: Exactly like day 2 but able to control symptoms more with additional NyQuil Severe dosages taken every 4hrs even though the symptoms would break through at about 2.5hrs. Again declined EMS and hospital visit. Felt well enough to try walking to the bathroom, woke up after an undetermined amount of time on closet floor with face and hair covered in blood and dried to the floor. Unaware of loosing consciousness or hitting face/ head on floor or loss of bladder. Once alert, able to move back to bed by crawling very slowly and requesting for spouse to assist in cleaning up mess on face and floor. Very concerned spouse advised to call EMS or hospital, but it was again declined as to not add additional expenses to the family budget and or create any other was to possibly get exposed to contracting COVID-19. Also was believed the patient would just be sent back home to rest without any real treatment completed. It was believed to be a waste of time and recourses in addition to a waste of time and money and not worth the added risks.  Day 4: Some improvements but all symptoms the same just not as severe as prior two days.  This severe unwell feeling continued for two weeks and the involuntary muscular spams began to slow down but not stop until day 6.  Day 7: able to go about normal routine although very weak and needing to take many breaks to rest and drink some fluids. No solid foods other than chicken broth and Jello at this point. This continued until Day 13.  Went to see doctor on day 8 of 2nd vaccine and discussed everything with her. She was very worried that I had such a severe adverse reaction and disappointed to not receive assistance through EMS or ER. She requested that this form be filled out and that my symptoms be reported. I didn't really want to as it was already bad enough to try and catch up on my daily life but to recount everything I went through in that time is daunting. Not to mention that I am still having severe ear issues with sudden loss of hearing and LOUD tinnitus. It comes and goes like someone turning it on and off. I have no history of hearing issues, random tinnitus or hearing loss. This is completely new since becoming vaccinated with the Covid Vaccine. I am concerned this is a long term effect as now it has been three months with no improvements. It seems like it may be increasing in frequency and the amount of hearing loss is more and lasting longer than before. Its beyond frustrating!  Now I am in a position where it is recommended that I do not get a booster vaccine and to wait on vaccinating our young children for they could have a similar or worse reaction to the vaccine. We are at a complete loss of what is the best action to protect our children!! We've been mostly isolated for nearly two years and our kids have been homeschooled during this time. They aren't playing sports or seeing any friends and family in person.

I stopped every few minutes to stoop and catch myself. I thought maybe it's just a symptom of pregnancy as I don't normally walk. That night there was a painful lump under my right arm. The next day every time I walked for more than 3 minutes my breath was cutting. In the afternoon I started getting cold sweats and feeling dizzy and checked my pressure. It was 133/can't remember. The previous day at prenatal checkup it was 99/ something. I drank some green mango juice to help lower the pressure and went to bed to sleep off the feeling. Next day I woke up with hard lumps on my butt. One on each butt cheek. They turned into abscesses including the lump that developed under my arm. Since then, I've been getting abscesses on my butt every other day and just below my right armpit. About a week after vaccine, I developed black and blue marks on my right thigh and leg. That went away and never developed anymore. I started getting muscle stiffness and soreness about a month ago and pain in pressure in my chest. I told my doctor about all these things who said it's not the vaccine. These things only started happening after the shot. Last Friday I developed an issue with my jaw.

Female who presents with HA, cough, wheezing, body aches, nausea, diarrhea, and poor PO intake. She states her symptoms started on 11/10/21. She currently lives with her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom are COVID+. She states as soon as she started to get sick, she knew it was COVID. She states she has not been able to eat or normally drink for the last few days as her symptoms progressed due to nausea.   On arrival to ED, she was tachypneic and hypoxic to 89% on room air. COVID test was positive. CMP showed mild hyperkalemia, BUN 28, Cr 1.3, Alk Phos 143. CBC showed mild leukocytosis at 11.49 with lymphopenia on the differential. Troponin x1 was 14 (indeterminate). Her lactic acid and BNP were normal. EKG showed paced rhythm, no ST elevation or depression. D-dimer was elevated at 1070. CTA thorax showed no evidence of PE but limited study, no additional signs of cardiopulmonary disease. She was given 500ml IV NS and subsequently admitted to the hospital for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to Acute COPD exacerbation caused by COVID-19 infection.   Upon arrival to the floor, the patient's blood pressure was still soft, and she was given another 500ml IV NS, to which she responded well. She was started on a 5-day course of remdesivir, a 10-day course of steroids, and a 3-day course of Azithromycin with regular duo-neb treatments. Due to her dehydration and hypotension on admission, we held her Entresto, sotalol, and spironolactone; they remained on hold until discharge for blood pressures in the 110's/70's. She showed steady improvement in wheeze and oxygen requirements, reaching mid 90's saturation on room air by day 3.

Patient is not hypoxic and symptoms have been present for less than 10 days, she does not qualify for remdesivir or Decadron. Main Reason for admission is weakness, patient and a live-in companion did not feel comfortable with discharge home due to level of assistance needed. Date of symptom onset: 11/13 Date of positive test: 11/15 - does not qualify for Decadron or remdesivir treatment at this time - daily CRP, D-dimer, complete blood count and CMP - PT and OT evaluation tomorrow - Tylenol p.r.n. for fever - Mucinex 2 times a day - Motrin 400 mg now for muscle aches Brief history and medical decision making: Patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities and deconditioning who presented to the hospital for shortness of breath and was found to be positive for COVID 19 pneumonia.  She had an episode this morning where she took her high-flow nasal cannula off, became very hypoxic and confused due to the hypoxia and pulled out her IVs. Patient frequently removes her high-flow nasal cannula and forgets that it needs to be kept time.  She ended up needing 100% FiO2 and was saturating in the 80s.  I had a discussion with her and her 2 daughters about code status.  The decision was made to make her do not resuscitate/DNI.  Patient is starting to do better on high-flow nasal cannula at this time.  I also updated her significant other about this decision and he agrees that it would be best that she not be intubated.  Patient's significant other said that he feels like he has COVID in losses sense of taste and smell.  I told him that he should go get tested for COVID and that he should not be in the hospital if he is symptomatic or test positive.  Pt didn't not get any oral meds because of mental status, Pt states that she needs help, but when staff tries to help she gets more agitated. Pulling at oxygen and all tubing safety attendant and nurse has been in there most of the morning. Morphine and ativan given this morning and this seemed to help Pt relax, more ativan was given about two hours later because of agitation. Pt oxygen continues to fluctuate, Pt is on high flow and non rebreather, Provider is aware.

Sometimes while sitting  I would get a jabbing feeling and would sigh more often Three weeks later, at about the time i needed to get the second dose, my feelings did not improve so I visited my family care doctor, who ran some blood work to rule out any deficiencies and then referred me to a cardiologist. At this point I stopped any exercising. My cardio testing was done at about 6 weeks after the initial vaccine and thankfully showed my heart was ok. I actually started to feel better about the 5th week. Maybe stopping the cardio heart exercises for a while helped me recover. A video i came across from a doctor suggested that cardio and strenuous exercises should be avoided for at least a week after the vaccine is administered to reduce the chance of heart issues. I wish I had known that before as i would have stopped training. They should do more to make that information known so others don't experience these symptoms or worse because  sometimes the damage may be irreversible.",,,,,,,,,U,10/06/2021,10/06/2021,0,"blood panel work including iron, vitamin d, and thyroid, C-reactive protein, Stress w/ echo cardio test",WRK,,"Vitamin D 50 mcg, iron 20 mg",N/A,N/A,,,2,11/22/2021,,Y,,N/A
