When the patient woke up on 07Apr2021, that the patient noticed the patient had developed a lump a little bit bigger than golf ball size under his left arm in his armpit which is painful to the touch. The patient thought it may have started to develop that lump on 06Apr2021 but did not notice the lump until morning of 07Apr2021. The patient was wondering what he should do. The patient needs to know if this was serious and the triage nurse couldn't tell him and his doctor hasn't called him back. Event was unusual because the patient has never had a bump like that lump he has at this time-caller stated bump as a descriptor of lump. The agent caller spoke to earlier advised patient that if the patient was uncomfortable or in pain to go to doctors office so patient called primary care provider who said to go in to have it checked. Caller reported the agent tells you about the symptoms and agent said that he had seen swelling of lymph nodes was one of the symptoms in his clinical trials information for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; and in those reports the swelling of lymph nodes usually goes away in about 10 days. Outcome of that event unable to be clarified as if recovered completely or with lasting effects-when queried caller reported that he did not notice any problems after that, did not have the pain at the injection site of left arm after that day or two.

Patient's medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none.

It dissipated into muscular and inner-skeletal pain. He had muscular pain down to pelvis and knees and things would start aching.  Now it was kind of letting up. It was the 4th day now and no one he knows who had gotten it had such a long term reaction to this. Clarified that he had slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at and that dissipated on Thursday 01Apr2021 and he had no pain anymore and no other side effects. On Friday 02Apr2021 afternoon when it went haywire and thought he may have to go to the hospital on Sunday 04Apr2021. He had diarrhea and almost had everything on the list except redness at the site injection. He also did not have swollen lymph nodes. He didn't think he needed to go to the hospital, he normally didn't get sick and hadn't been ill for years and this was why he wanted to report it because it seemed that it was pulling for along time. He had been sleeping and drinking a lot of liquids. Headache, joint pain, and diarrhea continued all the way through Monday 05Apr2021 and started to dissipate Monday evening. He had no nausea and vomiting. The muscular pain down to pelvis started Saturday 03Apr2021. His knee would ache and then that would stop and then his other knee would ache then stop. It was like it would transfer around lower part of body, and that dissipated late Monday 05Apr2021 night into Tuesday (06Apr2021). Now he had fatigue was tired and had sinus drainage. He felt dehydrated and couldn't seem to drink enough liquids to get the feeling of dry mouth out.  The diarrhea, fatigue and the sinus drainage was still continuing and the other symptoms seem to have dissipated. He still felt so fatigued and didn't feel the other symptoms are there. He hoped they didn't return. It had stayed the same for the diarrhea, fatigue and sinus drainage and he was still tired. Later added he did have weakness and dizziness, but assumed it was fever and chills. Caller states he did have weakness and dizziness and Saturday 03Apr2021 and Sunday 04Apr2021 were the worst two for all of the symptoms at the same time. It had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021 evening. Outcome of weakness and dizziness: Caller initially confirmed it had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021. However, he later stated he was still experiencing slightness there. He still feels some weakness, and feels about 60% right now.  He thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated because he had family members that had contracted covid-19 and be less weary of the virus. He was hesitant now to get the second shot. He was taking ibuprofen because he had issues with a tooth. He was taking Benadryl for the sinus and hadn't taken it in 36 hours and hadn't taking anything else. He was already taking Ibuprofen for the tooth issue, but was also using it to relieve some of the symptoms and if it was indeed that he may have contracted something after that.

Felt very Fatigued the day after getting the Vaccination: Lasted several days. But, got better with time.  Adverse event I wished to report: Seems this Vaccine might have, temporarily, hindered the effectiveness of a medication I take.  I'm on Amytriptyline 25mg, 2 a day at one time, for Postherpetic neuralgia on the right side of my face & right ear. This Amytriptyline medication has helped to cease all pain, including migraines, that I get from the Postherpetic neuralgia, and has also helped with the pain of pinched nerves in my back. Due to that, this medication has really helped improve my quality of life.  After getting the Vaccine, I went home and felt fine the first night. When waking up the next day, I found myself experiencing pain on the right side of my face and in my right ear. Thought this was odd as I took my medication the night before. But, as the day went on, it got a bit worse. That night i had trouble sleeping due to it. Then, the next day, I awoke with not only the pain at a level that it was before having treatment for it, but it also caused light sensitivity, migraines, and I could feel the right upper part of my jaw hurting as if teeth were aching that have been pulled years ago. I was also having vertigo when the ear pain got too bad.  This went on for several days and then faded away around the 20th of April 2021. Although I was confused as to why the Amytriptyline didn't seem to work as well on those days, I figured that it must be something to do with the vaccine effecting my nerves, or interacting with this medication. I did not seek medical advice for this reaction, as it went away. But just wanted to report it using this form.

It was like three days later that she suddenly became violently ill. At the time she did not tie it to the vaccine administration, she thought she had food poisoning or something. She then had severe diarrhea. She cannot recall the exact onset date of when the diarrhea began. She can't get the dates together because she knows she became very sick.

She said she spent a week in the hospital to build her INR level back up until she could go home at an INR number that was safe. She said she talked with the doctor, who was the head of the heart failure unit at the hospital. She said both the doctor and her felt the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine shot caused her INR problem. She said she now knows that she needs to bump up her warfarin dose if her INR were to drop after she gets the second Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

A 73 years old patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (lot/Batch: EN6206) on 13Mar2021 at single dose on left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was High blood pressure (Treatment of high blood pressure: ""Lisinopril dose one a day and dose is 12.5 according to it, it says here is HCTZ 10-12.5 mg it's oral tablet takes one at breakfast time); And then something else he takes because we had a storm earlier in summer, he was working where he works and wind just blew him face down into concrete side wall, but he put his arm up to resist it off, so he has been back and forth with his neurologist on this."" There is another one that he does take because of hitting the side walk when I told him the wind blew him the side walk, he put his arm up but he gets a little dizzy once in a while because of that. It's Meclizine 25 mg, tablet, afternoon and evening 2 times a day."" Concomitant drugs included Lisinopril, HCTZ and Meclizine. This past three weeks ago, 'my husband and I' (not clear) had our first injection for the Pfizer and within 4 minutes he was showing all kinds of reaction to it and he know he does not have reactions to very much of anything. I have no idea like it was something within the Pfizer medication that he was allergic to, allergic reaction. He stood on the floor I didn't figure out why he was standing up, he said the floor doesn't look steady to me which meant he was a little weak or dizzy whatever I don't know, so I reached over and I looked at his forehead and I said his forehead was dripping and I touched his forehead and it was cold, so the cold sweat coming from the forehead."" He was excessively tired for almost 2 weeks. Like I said he kept on standing up the couple of times and I said what's the matter and he said I don't feel like I am standing on a solid ground and I said yes you are, then he told me a few days later that his feet bothered him after that shot, he couldn't really describe what it was, but he told me it went right down to his feet and that's probably why he didn't feel right. So, anyway I end up calling over an RN and she and another RN had to take him over to take his blood pressure, his blood pressure went down and now only he had high blood pressure, he took his medication (Unspecified Medication) that morning like he always does and it went down to 107/70 and when they gave him a small bottle of water to drink and they said just stand up and take it. Took the medication stood up and it was 132/80, it was probably more than his normal. So, I mean I couldn't understand what was happening that he was tired through, excessive tired to the point that he didn't want to go to work, so I mean I didn't question what's wrong specially when I looked over and his forehead just dripping, for approximate 4 minutes after the injection. So, I mean I really don't know to have been that way. Then often had, he told me he had 'more' (not clear) saliva for a week and a half, it's just saliva in his mouth that kept on foaming up. I had noted to if this was anything that was never him, he has never had lot of saliva in his mouth anyway. But, this side of him of course it showed it was working and that lasted almost 2 weeks as well, 2 week I think 2 weeks. And now he is starting to feel better but he didn't feel well but better than 2 weeks after the first injection. I had taken that was on 13th, 13th took him to his doctor and he recommended to not take a second one. He felt very weak, I mean this took 2 weeks to go away. He did mention that when he stood up he didn't feel like he was standing on solid ground and I know this as I have been there probably for more than 50 years, so of course he was. He received them, his blood pressure dropped to a 107/70 went that down, changing back to 132/80, actually they gave him a bottle of water in between and he did drink water for it so. And his forehead was dripping cold sweat and he told me later that he felt something strange in feet and that's why he was standing up I couldn't figure that part out in fact he was on solid floor or solid ground, so I am thinking the weakness set in him very quickly. So, that he was really dizzy, I don't know and that's why I said I called over the RN and she grabbed another RN and they helped him over to take his blood pressure they took it down it was almost 107/70. Now if he has got high blood pressure, it just the blood pressure going to be really in morning and this is at 5:30 at night, doesn't mean like and he is a lot to me. And he had excess saliva in his mouth seem to be foaming in his mouth. I don't know if you had any of these reactions or unless it's just him I really don't know. When probed for the start date of the events (event not specified), reporter stated, ""Approximate 5:39, maybe 5:39, 5:40 in the evening which was last month, that on the 13th."" Reporter confirmed that patient would not go for second dose of vaccine and that reporter is due for second dose on this Saturday. And according to what I understand and what I was told 107/70 wasn't trending down, to me it was, but I am not a doctor nor a nurse or any other professional to have said not in medical field but when his forehead started dripping cold sweat and he was acting little strange and standing up and what is wrong because I was right next to him, I said what is wrong, he said I feel like I am falling down. The biggest one that bothers him beside being also retired for 2 weeks. He keeps on getting this foam in his mouth from saliva, excess saliva foam and that has no idea what's close to. High blood pressure, he had taken that tablet (Unspecified Medication) that morning. Actually the tiredness is gone away, the blood pressure is back to normal, like I said he was absolutely tired for 2 weeks and I think it coincide with Pfizer's 1 to 2 days. He is also having a headache and he just take Tylenol for that. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow up attempts needed.

A 74-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration at right shoulder on 27Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.

Patient has history of seasonal allergies and its prime time right now so its compounding. Relevant medical history includes, both knee replacement, pulmonary embolism, bad blood pressure problems maybe 5 years ago all on an unspecified date. The patient historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EN6198), at Right shoulder on 06Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  On 27Mar2021, When the patient got home from his shot, he had no problems at all and he went to bed. Being an old guy, he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and he lost his balance and took a nasty fall, so has a bummed up knee and stuff too, so that is what aggravates it. He clarifies he has a bum knee and nose after having the fall. Since he took the fall and has the bum knee, it is kind of a chore going up and down stairs.  On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced general sense of weakness , general tiredness. It has been over a week and he wants to know if that is unusual. Patient adds there was kind of a brain fog thing From: 28 Mar 2021  going on. The brain fog concerns him because he has to get his taxes done. He was still having trouble with the nose bleeds, which sort of compounds his misery, but he is getting better. It seems the side effects are getting incrementally better every day, but its not like he wakes up and its completely gone. It's like some prolonged illness. His side effects are getting marginally better. He is fairly clear headed today and he even had the nerve to take a short drive to the supermarket and stuff, although he wouldn't want to drive cross country in terms of being able to concentrate. But doing his taxes, will take a little work. Patient stated in the beginning he had muscle aches and chills from: 28Mar2021, but that went away after a day or two. Patient stated he had muscle aches/chills for a couple of days. He feels he has recovered completely as far as he knows. He never had nausea. On an Unspecified date patient mentions feeling a little short of breath, but states that could be more of the asthma thing. He does not recall having injection site pain at all. The tiredness is definitely ongoing, but has improved. He clarifies it has probably improved incrementally but doesn't really want to classify it as improvement because it might be temporary. He did not have a headache until he was waiting on the phone to speak to this call handler. On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced muscle pain for a few days and that sort of cleared up. This was the same with joint pain. After the big bang, clarified as the fall, everything proceeded. He still feels the muscle and joint pain, only in his knee, but its starting to fade. His knee was really a beautiful shade of purple, but it seems to be fading and hurting less so that is recovering, too. This pain is secondary. The side effect was the dizziness, stiffness, and inability to keep his balance. Caller states he was stiff as a board and he just couldn't move fast enough to get one foot in front of the other, and he landed on his knee, so the pain in his knee was not directly caused by shot. He felt fine at the center where he took the shot. He had to wait 15-20 minutes after the shot. He felt fine, drove home, went to bed, and in the middle of the night, it all started. He still feels a little dizzy and unsure and has been using a cane. He got both knees replaced and is worried that he damaged the actual replacement joint as opposed to just the muscle tissue. He just doesn't trust himself without the cane. He hasn't fallen over and hasn't passed out. He feels stiff all over but that could be from not getting to the gym and working out and not doing his regular work outs. Patient stated that the lethargy might be slightly better. He was making himself do more but he still gets really tired and it was really hard for him to get motivated, like to get out of the chair and go downstairs. He went to the supermarket and had to unload his car in stages- he took the perishables out and rested for a while and then went back out and got another couple of bags and then rested again. He just could not work straight through like he normally does. States he is in pretty good shape normally. He does not feel particularly great and that is the reason that he called to find out if this should last this long. Patient stated that he does have high blood pressure and heart problems. In fact at the end of the month, he will be going in for a catherization with Dr. (Name) so that was another reason he wants to have this stuff cleared up and out of the way. He still has dizziness and weakness. Patient stated that last night was the first night of decent sleep he had got. He has insomnia actually and he takes two sleep medications, but even taking those and washing it down with a glass of wine, he could not sleep for a whole week. He clarifies even with the Halcion and Ambien CR, it didn't work for a whole week- he could not sleep which adds to the brain fog. Typically, he goes to sleep, wakes up after a couple of hours, and then he is awake so he reads for a few hours and then takes the second medication and then sleep the rest of the night. He ends up getting a full 8-9 hours of sleep normally and he did that last night.   On 08Apr2021 he developed a pounding headache but it was probably independent of the shot. He took Tylenol and he is okay now, but he just thought it was ironic that he had one while waiting to talk to Pfizer when he hadn't had one before.

States he is not a fan of it and he doesn't like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it.

The patient previously received Flu vaccine and Tetanus vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. She got the shot on 25Mar2021 on Thursday evening at 1800. She is 49 years old and has had all the flu shots and tetanus shots. She has never had one hurt so bad. She stated that the vaccine was given up high on her arm, not 2 fingers down. She thought they had hit bone. It was reported that the patient experienced immediate pain when needle went all the way in and worse when vaccine went in. The whole time it hurt really bad and her arm hurt severely for 2 days from 25Mar2021. She still has pain in shoulder joint. That aside wasn't a big deal, it went away even though the joint is sore. The following Monday 29Mar2021 in the evening, her legs felt heavy and she had trouble going up the stairs. Then she had complete numbness of her left leg, from her hip or butt crack to the tip of her toes. It was on the same side she had the shot. It was further reported that the patient's legs felt heavy climbing stairs then she woke Thursday morning with her left leg numb. She couldn't feel herself starting to have a bowel movement because the numbness went all the way up to that area. She went to the ER (emergency room) on Saturday night (03Apr2021) because she was afraid of a blood clot. An ultrasound was done on her left leg, CT of head and neck, and blood work with nothing found. She has numbness and less range of movement in her left foot with trouble walking and have had no improvement with calf being numb. It was further clarified that when she was Easter shopping, there was numbness in her foot was causing her to drag her foot around the store. It was like someone who had a stroke, with slight impairment on one side. Her foot slaps the floor. She doesn't have control of it, she can't flex her foot up and down at all and she has little movement in her toes, even now. When she went to the emergency room, she thought she had a blood clot. She is a kidney donor and is healthy over all except for anemia that gives her tingly toes since she was 30, off and on. She never had a body part felt so numb, other than when she sits on her leg wrong. They did a bunch of tests there. They did a doppler, CT scan, and an EKG (unspecified date) which was abnormal. Her EKG has never been abnormal before. It said possible septal infarct undetermined time. The doppler showed no deep or superficial blockages noted from her groin down to her toes/ankle. The doppler was to check for blood clots. They referred her to her primary care provider who said that she will do a neurological exam. She has weakness in her left arm as well. The weakness in her left arm was only told by the neuro touch test. The patient further clarified that she doesn't have less range of motion, it is really just pain (arm). She can still move her arm all the way. Her left side is weaker or less sensitive as far as the neuro test. She wasn't aware she had less feeling on her arm until the nurse said she did. Her arm pain is nothing significant, it can hurt when moving her arm. She had no leg pain or anything like that until later in the week. She still had symptoms of losing her balance. Getting in and out of the chair she almost fell down. She didn't realize the numbness. Monday, she felt heaviness going up the stairs. For 2 days she had the worst pain ever in her arm. She had the tetanus shot and didn't have anything like that. It went away, when she raises her arm off from the side, she still has pain in the joint. She has migraines, it is nothing that is causing difficulty. She is more concerned something else happened. Patient thought maybe it is MS (multiple sclerosis) and asked if it is peripheral artery disease. She did smoke half a pack every other day. She is 49 but didn't start smoking till she was 36. It is a terrible habit and her doctor is aware. She also had her good and bad cholesterol which was just over 100. She is just reporting it because it happened on only the left side and she is a healthy person. She never had high blood pressure and never been treated for it, but she has had high heart rate before. It is not something that has ever caused any issue. She doesn't have something like peripheral artery disease, when she (software company name withheld) that is said plaque in the arteries. The doppler showed no signs of blockage superficial or deep on that side. She doesn't have an appointment until 29Apr2021. She doesn't know what to do to get more urgent care. The pain in her arm was better after the first 2 days. It is like a tooth ache, a dull ache. It is not all the time, just when moving her arm. Her legs were worse to where Thursday, she woke, and she was numb from the top of her leg to the tip of her toe. She can still lift her leg, but when she walks the tip of her second toe which is longer will drag on the ground. When she walks it is hard to hold her shoe on the left foot or put her shoe on. She can't maneuver her foot. When her foot hits the ground, the ball area of her foot smacks the floor because she doesn't have control over it. It is laboring to walk and is hard. She was kind of limping and pulling that leg on the left side. Her laboratory tests were BMP, CBC auto diff, CBC with diff, CT, angiogram of the head and neck, EKG 12 lead, and they did a venous doppler of the left lower extremity. It all came back good except the EKG which says septal infarct undetermined date, which has never come up on any tests before.

She further clarified that she got her first injection on 16Mar2021 and realized when she went on a flight, which is not that far she developed that clot and was having problems shortly after flight home on 24Mar2021 where her leg swelled up and she is on blood thinners since she went to the emergency room. She added that she developed the clot sometime between that flight and 02Apr2021. She had a doppler study on an unspecified date and it showed a blood clot.  She stated that the outcome was she does not have the blood clot (as reported) but she will be on blood thinners and she needs to follow up on her scan to see if the clot issue is resolved but she will not have a doppler scan for another month or two and the blood thinner she is taking is Xarelto.

Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that's what breath sounded like.

Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn't told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it's surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn't have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face.

Patient said she won't be able breath with them and that was what they did, they 'reflect' her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2' o'clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can't as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don't give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn't get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn't give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn't given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don't agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were.

Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn't have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it's most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it's phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn't have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that's it happens also.

Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that.

She has gotten the flu shot without eggs and been fine. The administering RN asked the med led to further assess. We discussed that she is at a higher risk for anaphylaxis than most people given her allergy history. She said that she was not Allergic to any component of the covid 19 vaccine when shown the list, and this was double checked. We discussed that if she gets the vaccine and has a reaction, she will need emergency room treatment and that she may want to consider being vaccinated at a hospital where they have more resources. However, given she did have known anaphylaxis to a component of the vaccine we will give it to her if she so chooses. It was explained that if she gets the vaccine, we will monitor her for 45 minutes, and if she has a reaction, she will be treated and sent to the E.R. She verbalized consenting to getting the vaccine after being thoroughly educated.  She was vaccinated at 1337 with 0.5 ml of Moderna Vaccine in the left deltoid. I was not present upon the administration. I was informed shortly after administration that she had cold sweaty palms and felt a little lightheaded. She was placed in a wheelchair and taken to a private observation tent to be further assessed. Initially in the tent she was not showing alarming signs of anaphylaxis and appeared stable. She had clear lung sounds and her oxygen level was 99% with no respiratory distress or airway compromise. At 1405 she felt her lips and throat get tingly and slightly bigger, although upon assessment they did not appear swollen. She was fasting and refused to swallow water or Benadryl when offered. She was able to swallow her spit with no issues. We explained to her that we are going to keep monitoring her, but if things change at all we are going to have to call 911 and administer epinephrine. She kept saying she is fine and that she did not want it and that her boyfriend would take her home. Currently her VS were BP 94/70, HR 72, O2 99%, RR 22. She was rubbing her back and her lungs were clear.  At 1410 her bp was 90/62, HR 74, o2 98% and RR 24. Again, she was rubbing her back. Her lungs sounded clear. At 1415 her BP was 84/60, HR 80, O2 93%, and RR rate of 30. She had small expiratory wheezes when listening to her breath sounds. She appeared to be in respiratory distress as she was coughing and rubbing her chest. She stated her chest felt back, neck, and chest felt tight. She still stated she was fine, and she did not have insurance. She was informed that this was a life-threatening emergency  At this time 911 was called as it was determined she was having an anaphylactic reaction needing epinephrine. Her Emergency contact was notified as he was on the phone with her. At 1417 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered into the left deltoid, which is where I was informed, she had received the vaccine. At 1420 her VS read 118/74, HR 122, O2 99%. Her respiratory distress appeared to be improving, and her VS improving.

Both injections were given at Cancer Center's Covid vaccine clinic. I began developing all-over itching and rash soon after the second vaccine and had a Teladoc appointment with Dr. on February 10th. He prescribed predniSONE 1 mg oral tablet and it basically did nothing. I then had another Teladoc appointment on Feburary 14th with Dr. and he prescribed predniSONE 20 mg oral tablet and the visit was short and I didn't feel heard and I decided to have a second opinion before taking more steroids. I then saw a Nurse Practitioner on 2/15/21 and she prescribed cephALEXin (Keflex) and methylPREDNISolone (Medrol Dosepack) and I began taking these prescriptions and the rash was still itchy but didn't seem to spread as much while I was on the steroid. As soon as I stopped the steroid, the intense itching returned and started spreading more. The rash and itching got even more intense, so I consulted another Teladoc physician and this time he was a dermatologist, he prescribed me a 21 day course of high dose steroids. This treatment made the itching subside and I didn't notice a rash while I was on the higher doses of the steroid but the itching and rash returned as I went to lower doses of the steroid as I was tapering and it completely returned even worse as soon as I was off of the steroid and I tried to just deal with it but it got worse as time went on. I then made an appointment with NP on March 22, and she took a skin biopsy of one of my spots and prescribed me Triamcinolone Acetonide cream to use all over my body to stop the itching. The biopsy results came back on March 30th and the results said it was a possible drug reaction/hypersensitivity reaction. The only thing new for me this entire time has been the Moderna Vaccine.

I was very hot and sweating through my clothese. My sister took me to the ER because the pain became intolerable. I went to the Clinic, Hospital ER for the chest pain (lot so heaviness and tightness in the sternum) and shortness of breath. My blood pressure was really high in the 140s/90s. I was in a lot of pain. I had a temperature. They did an EKG immediately that showed PVCs and a slight pause. Then, I had an XRay of the chest and lots of bloodwork. They did give me fluids and pain medication. The bloodwork had elevated d-dimer and low potassium levels, so they did a CAT scan with contrast to rule out a clot. It showed no clot, but had very enlarged lymph nodes on the left. They believed all of this response and chest pain was due to my 2nd dose of Moderna's COVID 19 vaccine.

1257325,04/25/2021,CA,66.0,66,,M,,"Possible COVID Vaccine Reaction  Introduction I am writing this because I think all of the issues described under the ?Current Situation? section may somehow be tied to an adverse reaction to my second COVID shot.  Until today, I had thought they were separate incidents with no common thread.  I now can see the possibility that they may be related.  I am asking for competent and engaged medical help to determine whether this is so, and if not, what the causes are for my issues.  I will give a brief medical history to give some current perspective.  Health History Current Vital Statistics ? Age: 66, Gender: Male, Height: 6?3?, Weight: 245  Hemorrhoidectomy ? In 1999 I had a hemorrhoidectomy to stop episodes of severe bleeding.  Heart Attack ? In August 2000 I had a heart attack, diagnosed as unstable angina, while on vacation.  They did further tests, found blockages and inserted stents in two arteries.  I was sent home with instructions to contact a cardiologist.  AICD ? After returning home, my new cardiologist did further tests and found evidence of ventricular tachycardia.  I was sent to a specialist who did an electrophysiology study and immediately implanted an AICD.  I have had it replace twice, with the latest one in April 2012.  It has never gone off.  There are close to five years left on my current battery.  Knee Replacement ? In January 2015 I had a total knee replacement of my right knee.  That was a result of several injuries and four surgeries, which left the knee without cartilage.  The knee replacement has worked flawlessly, and I am able to pursue athletics, especially playing tennis, without limitation.   Current Situation February 23 ? Received my first shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Other than minor soreness around the injection site, I had no other reaction.  March 29 ? Received the second shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Again, there was minor soreness around the injection site.  April 2 ? Had major pain in my tightness in my chest and major pain starting in my left shoulder and radiating down my left arm.  It caused significant discomfort, and I was awake a large part of the night deciding whether I need to call 911 for a possible heart attack.  I decided against that and instead went to urgent care in the morning (April 3).  My EKG was normal, my blood pressure was elevated (158/96 sitting, 157/91 standing).  Doctor could find nothing to suggest heart attack.  Prescribed a course of Prednisone for the shoulder/arm pain.  Had blood work ordered, which all came back normal.  April 5 ? Played doubles tennis as usual.  Noticed some weakness in my left shoulder and arm but played through it successfully.  The pain level was very low.  April 10 ? Played doubles tennis again.  From the first ball I hit I was aware of major weakness in my shoulder and arm.  They had no power at all, and I was almost unable to get my serve over the net.  I played through it again and played very poorly.  The interesting thing was that the pain and weakness did not worsen during the play or afterwards.  The pain remained after I had finished playing.  April 11 ? Chatted with the athletic trainer while I was officiating their women?s tennis match to look for clues as to what might be wrong.  He suggested in may be a shoulder impingement.  April 15 ? Had a phone consult with my primary care doctor.  I suggested the possibility of the shoulder impingement and he was willing to start there since this was a phone visit.  He referred me to orthopedics and physical therapy and prescribed meloxicam for pain.  The pain has continued unabated during this time.  April 21 ? Pain level was very high to the point where I was unable to work.  Went home and slept most of the day.  Meloxicam was not having much impact on the pain compared to my usual regimen of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (which I had stopped using when I was taking the meloxicam).  After this I stopped the meloxicam and went back to the other drugs as required.  I had an initial visit with the physical therapist that afternoon.  She did not find anything which would suggest a rotator cuff or labrum injury.  Range of motion was normal.  She noted weakness in my left side compared to my right, which is unusual since I am left-handed.  She gave me three exercises to do daily.  April 23 ? Pain had been back to a more tolerable level.  I had a COVID test in the morning for a treadmill test I have next week, and also got an x-ray of my shoulder as requested by my primary care doctor.  After I went to bed, I had an incident of severe incident of chills which left me freezing and short of breath even with sweats on under my bed covers.  I called my wife in to check my vitals.  My blood pressure was a bit higher than normal but not critical.  My blood oxygen was 98 and my pulse was 70.  My temperature was 99.7 with an oral thermometer.  We called the after-hours nurse hotline and spoke with a nurse.  By that time, it had been about 30 minutes of chills and they were subsiding.  She said she would have a doctor call in the next couple of hours.  The doctor called back, and after going over everything, said to come in if the symptoms reoccurred.  Thankfully they did not.  All the while I am still having the pain in my left shoulder and arm.  April 24 ? Again, slept most of the day due to being worn out from the previous night issues and lack of sleep.  No change in the pain and discomfort.",,,,,,,,,N,03/29/2021,04/02/2021,4,none,PVT,,"metoprolol, allopurinol, atorvastatin, fexofenadine, esomeprazole, aspirin",none,"Heart attack (2000), AICD (2001), Knee replacement (2015), GERD, sinus allergies",,,2,04/25/2021,,,,none

1257956,04/26/2021,MI,42.0,42,,M,,"On 4/22/21, approximately 1 hr after the Moderna COVID-19 first vaccination injection, I started to encounter allergic reactions that I used to suffer about 20 years ago. My air intake decreased, and my skin began to become irritated. I formerly had environmental allergies that would reduce my air intake, and the first place I noticed the effects were on my skin and I would become irritable. Physicians told me that when my oxygen levels were low, the body would channel the air to where it was most needed, which is generally not the skin, so my skin would become irritated. When this used to occur, I would respond involuntarily with facial twitches and pulling at my face and hair. Physicians explained that these twitches and pulling actions would draw air to the surface of my skin where I was air depleted. When I took the Moderna injection, this happened again -- I found myself with low air, my face was twitching, and I was pulling on my face to draw air to the area. The result when I was 19 and dealing with allergies is that I would remove small patches of hair from my head or eyebrows or eyelashes, and this would happen almost unconsciously as I tried to stimulate the areas and draw air to the surface of my skin. I did the same thing on 4/22/21, and found later, when looking into a mirror, that I had removed a section of my eyebrow unconsciously. It all comes back to oxygen depletion. A different and more intense event occurred in the night of Friday, 4/23/21, and the early morning of Saturday, 4/24/21. I went to bed at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Between that time and approximately 1:30 a.m., I had difficulty sleeping, and I dreamed of pain in my chest. I finally woke up about 1:30 a.m. and found the pain in my chest was real. I was having difficulty breathing deeply. It felt as if  the lower part of my lungs (at least on one side) was solidifying or inaccessible. What I did was begin forcing myself to breathe as deeply as possible. Over a period of 30 minutes or longer, I was able to gradually reclaim the use of the deepest part of my longs. With every forced deep breath, I was able to chip away at the area that felt like it was freezing up. Finally, I felt that I could access the deepest part of my longs and breath normally. The pain and lack of use in my lower lungs were very concerning.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/22/2021,04/22/2021,0,,PHM,,None,None,Seasonal Allergies -- effectively treated 23 years ago,suffered the flu after multiple flu vaccines,,2,04/26/2021,,,,None

1258185,04/26/2021,TX,48.0,48,,F,,"Before I start, I've really tried documenting this to you earlier and it kept timing out on me. Hopefully the third time is a charm! On Saturday, April 17th at approximately 11:55 am, (45 mins after my shot) I started experiencing partial paralysis to the left side of my face. My cheek bone started to go numb, within the hour, after a weird tingling sensation, it went from my cheek bone down towards my jaw (all becoming numb). This lasted all weekend. I used cold compresses for a little bit at a time just to make the heat coming off of that side feel a little better as my face was flushed. On Monday, April 19th, my lower cheek started to not be so numb. The tingling sensation would come and go from my eye brawl, then the side of my mouth/lip area. I developed a headache that Monday evening. Tuesday morning, my headache was gone. This tingling sensation and partial numbing would last through Wednesday, April 21st. That day, I called my doctor's office and told them about my reaction and to see if they could do some blood work or something. They said that I needed to go to the ER at a hospital for help and to get it documented. Out of all weeks for me to have a side effect, this busy mom had too much going on to schedule an ER visit. My daughter is going into high school and she had auditions and clinics where I had made the choice to figure out I will try to go there on another day. By Thursday, April 22nd, my cheek bone started to become un-numb. The affected side started to feel like the other side of my face. During this entire time, I didn't take any medicine. By Friday, April 23rd, I felt much better. I have more control of my face muscles and I feel like this might be something that was just temporary, but I told myself that if it comes back in any way, I will go to the ER regardless of what is going on in my life. It was a scary thing and now as I look at my card, it reads that the second shot is May 8th at 11:15. I am really scared to get that because who knows what will come from it and I wouldn't want to get anything permanent. I know with traveling, some countries are making it mandatory to be vaccinated. So does this mean that I will not be able to travel if I don't get that second shot. I have no idea what to do with this appointment. Any advice would be great! As of today, April 26th, I feel 95% better on my left side of my face but if I sleep on it for too long, it tends to feel heated at my cheek bone. Aside from that I'm much better. Now onto the second side effect, my left arm muscle was in excruciating pain and I could not lift my arm for two days. It effected my elbow to my shoulder. After Monday, April 19th, my arm started to get better every day. This was the arm that I got my shot in. Today, April 26th, is the first day it seems back to normal. I know you can have a sore arm with this shot, but this was much more than a sore arm. My left side of my face, my left arm, and a headache were the only abnormal events that took place after my first Covid shot. I am thankful to be feeling much better, but will continue to monitor the situation of my face as that is what is most concerning about this vaccination.",,,,,,,,,N,04/17/2021,04/17/2021,0,N/A.

I also got the coughing towards the end of Covid and then had Covid pneomonia and was hospitalized for 4 days as my body just needed oxygen. I was hoping to take the vaccine so I wouldn't get the full Covid illness again. I took my first dose of the vaccine Wednesday morning, 4/21. I only felt tired Thursday morning, 4/22 however by middle of the afternoon I began to have shivers and was very cold. As the night went I was feeling terrible and had first seen a 104 temp but thought I took it wrong. Later took my temp again and was 102.5. After taking some ibuprofen my temp went down to 99.8. I had terrible leg pain and restless legs and couldn't get comfortable the entire evening, full body was in pain. It was worse then having actual Covid, I've never had my body feel that bad before but very glad it was for a shorter time period. Very sore and stiff, almost as if I couldn't get up to use the restroom. I was sleeping in and out (trying atleast) and woke up with night sweats around 11pm. I do think my fever had finally broke around then. I was in communication that night with my friend who is a nurse and we both hoped I would be better by the next morning. Thankfully I did sleep the rest of the night and only felt very tired and exhausted Friday & Saturday. Friday, it was still hard to get out of bed, alot of soreness but glad the fever was done. Saturday was better just tired and started to feel almost back to normal again on Sunday (5 days post my 1st vaccine dose) just still tired even today on Monday, 4/26.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/21/2021,04/22/2021,1,No medical tests,PHM,,"Womens Daily Vitamin, Vitamin D supplement, Hair Skin & Nails supplement with Biotin, Vitamin C gummy",None,"PCOS: poly cystic ovarian syndrome, heart surgery at age 2 due to born with a hole in left coronary artery, overweight",,,2,04/26/2021,,,,None known

The adverse effect date and time is a mandatory field. This is the reason I filled adverse date and time. I had my 2nd dose of vaccine on April 25, 2021 at campus at 1.20 PM. I just felt the syringe just touched the peripheral of my skin. I told the nurse that I do not feel I get the shot. Later, I do not feel any side effect any effect. I had no pain, or the site of injection was not swollen. I am worried I did not get the 0.3ml dose. During the first shot on April 4, 2021 at 1.43 PM, I felt pain on shoulders. I felt my tongue got thickened/ some tingling sensation on tongue and a little slur in speech. After 6 hours, I felt headache, a little chill, light head, nausea, more pain on shoulders and the next day, I felt light headedness and I felt tired for few days. I consider these as normal side effects and nothing unusual from what I read in internet and what I heard from others. So, I did not report it and it was a normal thing for me. Since I experienced this in first dose, I expected a more severe reaction than first dose. But I did not even feel pain at the site of injection nor any usual symptoms that usually appear. This made me to doubt I got required dose or the vaccine was correctly withdrawn from the vile. I do not know how to confirm that I got correct dosage. If I have not received the full dose, I am ready to take an additional shot and I would be flexible to take the shot at the available time near to my living place on any day.

Adverse events experienced and are they still occurring now: Pain on left side mostly on moving, unable to describe the nature of the pain (ex unable to clarify if aching, sharp, etc), not in the arm, but generalized all over mostly on the left side, no numbness no tingling, pain comes and goes, not getting any better or worse, Acetaminophen helps. Acetaminophen to treat (Q 6 hours 500 mg x 2). I adv Acetaminophen is fine but don't exceed this amount. Can also alternate with other OTC pain relievers as needed. Also try a heating pad for the pain. Advise that if pain doesn't start to feel better in the next few days and resolve in a week, consider this may be unrelated. FU with HCP if pain worsens/persists.  Provided phone # for FU. I asked if ok to follow with her, but pt. declined us calling her. However she would like to call us back herself, and speak directly to me.  I adv to call back Friday after 7 PM in that case when I'm back. I'll put in a FU for Friday at 10:15 AM in case she doesn't reach out.  4/25-Pt calling back, pain is improved by about 50% since we last talked but persists. No fever.

Didn't see her long time PCP in person, just gave him a call and is expecting a call back on Monday. Is ""100% confident"" that this issue isn't medical and is related to the shot.  Got the shot at hospital. Still doesn't have the CDC card unable to provide lot number. 93 lb wt.  Pain was very severe on the first half of the week starting on Monday. Should she still get the second shot? I adv the second shot wouldn't be contraindicated in this case, but adv to discuss this with her doctor more to discuss risks and benefits. Informed the patient that there are no existing case reports with this type of severe or persisting pain so would recommend an in person evaluation with either PCP, urgent care, ortho, etc.  Agreed with caller to discontinue the IBU and Acetaminophen if it doesn't work, can try some heat to try and help relief.

1258564,04/26/2021,NY,51.0,51,,M,,"State opened Covid vaccines to 50 and over on Mon, March 22. I immediately scheduled my appointment for a first shot at a Dept of Health site near me for Wed, March 24. I had no immediate negative side effects. When I woke on Fri, March 26 and commenced my day of remote work from home, I noticed my left eye vision was blurry. I proceeded to work that day and continued my normal activities into the weekend assuming my vision would self-correct. By Sunday, March 26, my left eye vision was still noticeably problematic so I scheduled to see an optometrist whom I had seen before. I saw him at 12:15pm on Tues, March 30. After running numerous vision tests, optometrist let me know my vision loss in the left eye seemed to be the result of a stroke that had cut blood flow in the optic nerve and damaged my vision in the lower portions of the left eye. The center and upper portions of my left eye were generally unaffected at that time. He suggested I see my primary care physician to check for vitals, such as blood pressure and do other blood work, and more importantly see a neuro ophthalmologist urgently.   The next morning, Wed, March 31 I saw my PCP, who informed me my blood pressure was normal, requested blood work, and gave me a prescription for an MRI of my brain, with and without contrast. I am 6'2"" and I weighed at 239, about where it has been for most of last 15 years. I also complained of pain and stiffness in my front right thigh and lower right back. She said if I didn't get an appointment to see a neuro ophthalmologist that same afternoon, she recommended I go to an ER. With the help of Optometrist's office, I was able to get an appointment that day with Dr., neuro ophthalmologist at 2:15pm on Wed, March 31. His office repeated numerous vision tests and confirmed the left eye vision loss (essentially the lower half excluding the center) and diagnosed it as a NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. With this diagnosis, there was no treatment, and I scheduled a follow-up for May 12. He said that my optic nerve into my left eye would slowly reduce its swelling over the next 6 to 8 weeks and in that time, my vision could remain the same, or improve. At that point, I didn't think it would worsen, but sadly that later happened. In addition to the the first MRI that PCP prescribed, Neuro ophthalmologist prescribed a second MRI of orbits, with and without contrast. He also suggested I begin taking a low dose Aspirin daily, which I did.   The next week, the blood work revealed a very slightly elevated cholesterol reading. I was told by my PCP on April 5 that this would normally not be considered as a problematic level of high cholesterol, but should be improved or lowered. The blood tests taken at Lab on Fri, April 2 revealed a LDL Chol, Calculated as 111, whereby <100 was considered desirable range. Other than that, there was nothing of concern in my blood work. The two MRIs were done on April 9 and April 20, and did not reveal findings which doctors felt would have impacted my optic nerve swelling or had caused the eye stroke. Out of precaution, I scheduled to see a cardiologist on Tues, April 13. She recommended I start taking Crestor for cholesterol, and do a series of tests which I completed on Friday, April 23 - echocardiogram; holter monitor; transesophageal echocardiogram; and ultrasound carotid bilateral. As of today, Mon, April 26 I do not know the results of the cardio work-up, but both neuro ophthalmologists I saw felt that a problem related to my heart would not have caused this stroke in my eye.   Finally, on Fri, April 23 I had a consultation with a second highly recommended neuro ophthalmologist. After a series of vision tests, she agreed with other doctor's diagnosis of NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. She also said there was nothing I could do to treat except wait for the next 4 or more weeks for the optic nerve swelling to go down. She also confirmed my fear which was that my left eye vision had worsened since March 31 as my vision loss was no longer limited to the lower portion of my left eye, but now included blind spots throughout the upper range of my left eye vision, making my loss of peripheral vision worse and more widespread. She said in some cases with NAION, a patient's vision could remain the same, could improve or could worsen in the 6 to 8 weeks after the event. Four weeks after the March 26 event, by April 23 my left eye vision had worsened. I still hold out hope that it can improve some in the next four weeks... My right eye vision was not affected in any way, although one risk of NAION is that there is a 20% (?) chance it may recur in the next 5 years, and if it does, it most commonly affects the other, good eye.   None of the doctors I saw directly attributed my vision loss to the Moderna vaccine taken on March 24; however, there has also not been a clear cause determined by my doctors. While most of the doctors I saw seemed to think it coincidental, none also was able to absolutely rule it out either as a cause or a trigger. Dr. suggested I follow through with this idea, which other medical professionals suggested, to submit this vaccine adverse event report. Without a doubt, this was an adverse effect and/or problem that occurred soon after (36 hours approximately) taking the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.",,,,,,,,Y,N,03/24/2021,03/26/2021,2,"explained in description of adverse event, treatment, and outcome.",OTH,,"lithium carbonate, occassional ibuprofen or ibuprofen PM",none,"bipolar disorder, diagnosis 2005",,,2,04/26/2021,,Y,,none known

She was ?curled up on the floor in the closet.?  The suicidal ideation resolved after 1.5 days at the same time as the body aches resolved.  She is not sure if the suicidal ideation was a side effect to the injection or triggered by the body aches from the vaccination.  She had not had any suicidal ideation in the timeframe prior to the vaccination.  Her last suicidal ideation prior to this event was about one year ago.  She has not had any suicidal ideation since the 1.5 days after the vaccination.  She was also having trouble recalling information during the 1.5 days after the injection  or ?form complete sentences?I would forget things mid-word.?   The cognitive effects lasted 1.5 days.  She did not have any adverse effects after 1.5 days.  She did not cut or have any urges to cut.  She last had urges to cut a couple of months ago.  She did not have any illicit drug or alcohol or marijuana use during that timeframe.  She thinks the body aches and suicidal ideation developed at the same time (as compared to one starting before the other).  She also had chills but did not check her temperature.  She did not take any NSAIDS or Tylenol.  She did not experience any other acute psychiatric symptoms during the 1.5 days.  She did not have psychosis, mania, depression, PTSD or OCD triggered.  She did not have any new medications during this timeframe.  Her COVID 19 infection was in March of 2020.  She thinks it is possible that the vaccination was a ?trigger? to suicidal ideation because during her COVID-19 infection she wondered if she was going to survive.  She did not have suicidal ideation back in March of 2020 during her COVID-19 infection.  She said her ?resolve? to kill herself was unique for the 1.5 days stating, ?the only reason I didn?t do it was I couldn?t get up.?  She did not go to the hospital ?because I had no way to get there.?  She realizes she should have called 911.  The experience was ?scary.?  She said she did not think about calling me adding, ?I didn?t know what to do?I couldn?t think straight...I couldn?t even remember my birthday but I do that a lot?my birthday was never celebrated.?  She had the Pfizer vaccination.  The only side effects after the first injection of the vaccine was congestion and a sore arm (both of which lasted three days).

In that moment I was just concerned with not having that area disinfected, but since I felt no pain I was happy and I thought she was the greatest. In that same evening I began experiencing pain in my arm. My arm has been in so much pain and my range of motion with that arm is about two inches. When I first stared to feel that my arm was hurting I attributed that to the vaccine. I then stared noticing that I was loosing the range of motion with that arm and yet I had no other symptoms from the vaccine.  Every night the pain is intolerable as my arm hurts so much, even when doing nothing. Even the pull from gravity makes my arm hurt. I went to the Health Department on April 19, 2021 to let them know what was going on with my arm and that I have no other symptoms and they totally dismissed my concern, they said, that since it is not bruised or swollen there is no reason to be concerned. They did say that the shot was given to me in a unusual high spot, but that it  was nothing to be concerned about. They also said that it was totally normal to have arm pain after the vaccine and didn?t even acknowledge that I can?t move my arm and that I am in so much pain. I ended up going to urgent care and the doctor there gave me a splint and said that this was normal pain due to the vaccine. He put me off of work for two days, but my arm is not getting any better. On 4/21 I went to follow up with my primary physician as the pain on my should was expanding and now I have shooting pains toward my neck. She gave me tramadol and ibuprofen for the pain, she also told me to ice my arm and do range of motion stretches. I went back to the doctor on 4/26 as the pain has not gotten better. I have some improvement in my range of motion as I have been doing the stretches that the doctor advised me to do but the pain in my shoulder is still very intense, especially at night. I was told to continue taking tramadol and to now apply heat to my shoulder.

By the next morning I was feeling better and the soreness in my arm was gone but instead I felt  pain that starts from my upper arm and goes all the way down to my forearm. Sometimes, I feel a tightness that starts around my neck area and goes down to my upper arm and will always linger on my forearm. I get this sharp, intense pain throughout the day. I tried icing it, I tried tylenol, aleve, ibuprofen, Icy Hot, ben gay, and salonpas. None seems to work. After about a week, I went to see my doctor and she prescribed Gabapentin for the pain. My doctor didn't really know what was causing the pain in my arm since the vaccine is still new. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking the medicine in about a week since it didn't help with the pain and it caused me to have blurry vision and insomnia. It is now April 26 and I'm still experiencing the same pain in my left arm. I have not been able to sleep on my left side and have a hard time sleeping at night due to the pain.

Patient was in her usual state of health until 3/1/2021, when she developed sudden-onset pain ""across the entire chest"".  She shares that her symptoms ""came out of the blue"", as ""suddenly one day, everything just hurt"".  She saw her primary care physician, who initially felt her symptoms were due to acid reflux.  As such, the patient started ""eating antacids and omeprazole like candy"".  However, her chest pain persisted, prompting her to follow up with her primary care physician on 3/16/2021.  At that time, ECG reportedly showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute changes.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed abnormal enhancement and thickening of the pericardium with trace pericardial fluid, consistent with pericarditis.  The patient was therefore started on colchicine and an ibuprofen taper.   On 4/5/2021, Patient sent a myVM portal message to her primary care physician and cardiologist, expressing her belief that her chest pain has remained unchanged over the past month.  She continues to experience a constant burning sensation throughout her chest, aggravated by deep inspiration and alleviated by lying flat on her back.  She shares that walking up the stairs at home leaves her ""breathless"".  Associated symptoms include subjective fevers, chills, and night sweats.  Given these symptoms, Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed findings consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion.  Patient was then advised to present to the ED for further workup as an inpatient.   At time of hospital admission, patient endorses persistent chest pain during inspiration.  Prior to 3/1/2021, she has never experienced these symptoms and reports no history of pericarditis.  The most strenuous physical activity she has undertaken in the last month include working in the garden and caring light boxes down the stairs.  She is most concerned about the fluid around her heart.  Patient reports no nausea, vomiting, palpitations, constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

Doctor's report back on test results: I have received and reviewed your lab results. Your comprehensive laboratory evaluation for your joint pains is quite reassuring with no significant concerning findings. Your complement level (CH-50), CRP, & ESR are elevated, which are all acute-phase reactants and can be elevated due to a number of reasons. However, given recent vaccination and rather robust response to vaccination, I would be most inclined to think that this is due to vaccination with a robust immune/body response to vaccination. CH50 or individual proteins, such as C3 or C4, may increase up to 50 percent of baseline values as part of the acute-phase response, or response to infection, inflammation, or in this case, vaccination. Beyond this, an elevated CH50 has no specific clinical significance. This is an expected part of your body's immune response. High levels in themselves do not lead to tissue damage, as the proteins are not in their activated state, and regulators tend to increase in parallel. Low levels are much more concerning for a complement deficiency. Thus, I do not see any clear reason or indication for further evaluation or intervention at this time.

About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life.
