Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read ""normal"" and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm>leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of ""wave"" of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.)

Alternative consideration would be a focal encephalitis, which is felt less likely. No abnormal enhancement is seen in this region. Consider repeat MRI upon resolution of seizure activity to document resolution of imaging findings.  MRI 5/16: 1.  Asymmetric, subtle right cerebral gyral swelling and increased signal. In the associated regions there is prominent sulcal enhancement which may be due to secondary vascular changes (slow flow or hyperemia) versus leptomeningeal enhancement.

While I recovered from the ache and fatigue the next day (04/11), the neck pain continued for a couple of weeks. On 23rd April, the pain aggravated and I took a 2 Advil's (2 tablets of 200mg each) which made the overall pain extremely critical. The pain was mainly in the neck, upper arm, tingling in the fingers, grinding jaw pain, all symptomatic to a cardiac pain.  I visited the Urgent care and they suggested I rush to Emergency care. See the notes attached. I was detected with Myocardial infraction or Heart Inflammation (as there was an increasing Troponin). They did an Angiogram to detect any blockages but was cleared of all blockages or major heart conditions. Was hospitalized for 2 days and was on observation for any new pains, repeat or increase in symptoms.

On 4/29/21, I had a virtual appointment with a naturopath about a completely separate health issue (mold illness), and she asked me to check my blood pressure.  I checked my blood pressure using my father in law's at home cuff, and it was 149/99.  I continued to check over several days and had persistently elevated readings, ranging from 122-165/93-107.  My last known normal BP reading was in February of 2021 and was 110/70, which is my typical BP.  I had not checked my BP at any time between February and April because I had no reason to believe it would be elevated.  On 5/2/21, I had a reading of 165/107, which prompted me to go to the ER.  At the ER in triage, my BP was 188/144.  EKG was normal and troponin I was normal.  I was monitored for a few hours with BP around 155/100, and after a dose of Nadolol, my BP came down to 122/79.  I also had chest pain/tightness during this experience, which may have been due to anxiety.  My BP has continued to be persistently elevated (now coupled with anxiety about what is going on, which doesn't seem to be helping the numbers!), and I had to return to the ER on 5/5/21 after getting an at home reading of 180/122 (this was about 1 hour after taking a dose of Nifedipine).  At the ER triage, my BP had come down to 140/109, so they sent me home.

I was vaccinated in the passenger side of my car in the left arm. As such I had to twist around (with difficulty due to some of my conditions) and the vaccinator had my arm wrenched up and backwards at an angle nearly perpendicular to by body.  After getting my first shot my arm was in immediate significant pain. It started swelling immediately and I was monitored for 30 minutes but told I was not having an allergic reaction so I was likely fine. The pain in my arm worsened into and over the evening and felt as if my arm had been mangled or crushed in some sort of accident. I assumed this normal arm pain. My arm was very swollen. The joints in my hands, fingers, wrist, elbow, we?re also very swollen, red, and painful. The pain at the injection site did not dissipate and I was bruised for several weeks. It was difficult or impossible use my arm and hands (both). I checked in with my doctor after a week. She believed this was an over immune reaction related to my chronic health conditions and believed it would settle itself in time for my next shot and advised me to check in if it did not go away in two weeks. A few days before my next appointment the symptoms had not abated and the pain in my shoulder appeared to be getting progressively worse.  I had radiating pain down my arm at this point and continued swelling all over along with continued swelling and pain in all the joints in my hands, fingers, wrists and elbow. I was advised by my doctor to go to urgent care (I am out of state from staying with my mom). They checked for blood clots and infection and found no signs of either and believed the problem to be an over reaction of my immune system to the vaccine. I was prescribed a Medrol pack. I went to my scheduled second vaccination but was told that they would not vaccinate me after they asked about my reaction to the first shot and looked at my hands and arm. They wanted me to take the medrol pack and reduce the inflammation in my arm before administering the second injection. I took the medrol pack and had mixed success. The first days on the high dose helped reduce the pain and swelling all over but on the days with the lower dose most of the symptoms came back. I contacted my doctor and was prescribed prednisone starting at 40mg/day. At this time the pain in my shoulder was continuing to get progressively worse so I returned to the urgent care. There I received a physical exam and x-ray and the doctor believed I had a shoulder injury (impingement/rotator cuff issue) and bursitis. My shoulder has a stabbing sensation like a knife around the injection site that radiates down the the side of my arm and up over the top front and back of my shoulder. It hurts when I touch it, raise my arm, bend it, try to hold or lift anything, when I am physically active (such as going for a long walk), or sit or lean in certain positions (mostly very forward or back into objects, like the back of the sofa).  All of this makes this area painful but also makes the all over swelling worse and worsens the swelling and pain in my hands, fingers, wrist, and elbow. I have not had any other accident or injury. Due to my chronic health issues I am extremely cautious and have a very precise and conservative exercise regimen (just walking, gentle yoga movements). This shoulder pain very definitely started at the time of the vaccination and has progressively worsened over the course of eight weeks. I have been told to treat it with rest, pain meds, gentle movements, and ice, all of which I have been doing, however the pain and impairment persist. I started the prednisone after the visit to urgent care but on day three began experiencing severe pain in my right eye, face, back of my head, and blurred, unfocused vision. I also had a complete loss of appetite and upset stomach. I was advised by my doctor to immediately stop the medication. I experienced several days of withdrawal symptoms, and the head pain and visual problems have gotten better though they have not completely gone away. The prednisone alleviated some of the arm swelling and pain but the joint pain and swelling in my hands, fingers, wrists, elbows, while a bit better, still remains. While I was diagnosed with arthritis in a few joints (first, second, and thumb knuckles and have had some wrist problems) they were never this severe, as long lasting, or this painful (usually just brief hour long irritation of a knuckle or two). I had not been treated with medication for this ailment because the problem had not been very bad. I am also now experiencing pain in many other joint I have never had problems with (such as other fingers). Sometimes the swelling and pain are debilitating and I am unable to use my hands at all.

Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller reported that she received her first Pfizer COVID vaccine dose on Friday at 5pm. She reported that right away she got a numb nose, numb top lip then it spread to her chin and her cheeks and to her forehead. Saturday and Sunday her face was still numb, and she also had tingling in her hands. Caller explained that the feeling was like when your leg fell asleep and was waking back up. Caller also reported that her arm hurt. Caller stated her face still was not feel correct, still numb or tingling. During this call the caller mentioned that her husband's co-worker got a swollen face and needed a shot of Benadryl after getting her vaccine. And another report from the News that showed a woman's whole face got swollen. She reported that she read that people should not take Benadryl prior to getting the vaccine because it might mask effects. She reported that she did not take anything prior to the first one and was asking whether it was ok to take Benadryl while getting the COVID vaccine. and whether there were the contraindications to taking Tylenol prior to getting the vaccine. Caller stated It did not take long to produce a vaccine, we need more, they keep saying there was a shortage, it took 3 weeks to make an appointment. Pfizer need to do something about encouraging a lot of people to get the vaccine, I did not see many minorities getting these shots, this was very concerning to me as a pharmacist. Also, they were gone come up with something better or not so hard to handle for pharmacists. This whole ultra-cold thing was too much. Caller reported of being upset at Pfizer and the CDC stating 'Pfizer and the CDC said it was ok to use the overflow as a 6th dose. It's a 5-dose vial, people were pulling from multiple vials to get that 6th dose'. That's just not right, she did not see them, but she heard that now Pfizer was charging for the 6th dose. Pfizer really should put out a statement to these facilities giving the shot that the nurses should be taking names and lot numbers and sending a list to Pfizer of people who have a problem. No one was taking down adverse events at these places. She inquired that why was Pfizer putting PEG in their vaccine. It should not be in there. Caller was asking about the Bell's palsy - How long can it before someone could potentially have it after getting the vaccine. Caller was asking where her vaccine was manufactured.  Follow up (15Feb2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. This pharmacist reported that: nose and upper lip got numb, it spread through her face, her cheeks and kind of her eyes and forehead. both hands were tingling a little. arm was very painful. She was calling about COVID vaccine, wanted to let Pfizer know, she had the shot on Friday at 5PM, the 13Feb2021 and shortly after, her nose and upper lip got numb, it spread through her face, her cheeks and kind of her eyes and forehead, and on Friday it was still numb, and today, on Sunday it was a little bit, and today, she was still slightly numb, it was kind of tingling, like if she was outside shoveling snow a few hours like that was how the face feels. She did not want to forget, both hands were tingling a little and her arm, at night, when she came home her arm was fine, she had full range of motion, she was ok, then at night it was very painful, she woke up in the morning, it was ok, but felt like an ACE bandage tied around too tight. But she was very concerned about numbing of the face and tingling. She was a pharmacist. No none knows anything about this, it was very sad, in fact, she was concerned about the fact she had 2 nurses come over, both stood and were chatting, and no one took her name, the lot number, or took down the adverse reaction she had to it, it was not right at all, and she went on Sunday, she went with her husband, as they wouldn't let then have it at the same time, which was a joke, and in inclement weather, and there was a nice nurse and he helped her, but no one knows anything, she waited for her husband, and she specifically asked, she said she was concerned about the second shot, she did not want a reaction with the second, as she was not near a hospital, they were having massive vaccine areas, and a nurse came over and she said she knew nothing about it, said it could be a reaction, it could be the doctor, but caller said it was not a reaction, it happened immediately after she got the shot. If this has something to do with this nurses and doctors should be reporting back. Height and weight declined. States she did not want to provide all that. Primary care doctor information declined, she did not have one, if she goes to her cardiologist, he will say ask the doctor or pharmacist, she is a pharmacist, and no one know anything, nurses know less, her concern was; she was already on the phone for a long time, and she was afraid with the second shot she would have a worse reaction, she did want a reaction where she cannot breathe. This was an experimental drug, no one knows anything about it, it was approved for emergency use, and not FDA approved. She was the patient and could not get a question answered. Stated she spoke to USMI already, stated one nurse said plenty of people were having the same thing, stated to just document that someone should be at least looking into the lot numbers, then caller abruptly disconnected the call. There was a Product Complaint. Caller reported side effect and said someone should be at least looking into the lot numbers, then caller abruptly disconnected the call.

Medical history included seasonal allergies (had it his whole life), sore arm and a family history of shingles (he's had an uncle or something that had shingles before but nothing with his parents). The patient had no allergies to medications, food or other products. Concomitant medication included loratadine (CLARITINE) from Feb2021 for seasonal allergies. The patient wanted to know on what he should expect after receiving the second dose of the vaccine and if he was eligible to receive the vaccine. The patient reported side effects on v-safe. He heard from other doctors that shingles had been reported from the first dose of the vaccine. He wanted to know if shingles would impact the antibodies that he may develop post vaccination. The patient stated that the fact sheet indicated that the second dose should be administered 3 weeks after the first dose, he was scheduled to receive the second dose 4 weeks later and wanted to know if it was safe to receive the vaccine outside the of the recommended time frame. The patient stated that he should be trying to take loratadine everyday (usually takes at night before bed) 1 since he does get kind of bad allergies sometimes. On 12Mar2021 (8 days later after the vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with shingles after breaking out in a rash on his scalp, chest and neck. The patient met his doctor and was recommended to report the adverse event. The patient went through CDC V safe and was provided with an information sheet that from Walgreens that listed the number for Pfizer to call if he needed further information. The patient reported that the noticed the rash (present on his scalp, chin, neck and up around his neck on his right side) on 06Mar2021 or 07Mar2021. The patient stated that the rash onset was ""two fold"". He noticed it when the back of his head on the right side started to become agitated in Mar2021.  He stated that he sleeps with an eye mask on due to block out the lights from the baby monitor for his 6-month-old and originally thought that it was the sleep mask that was bothering him. He mentioned that on 06Mar2021 or 07Mar2021, he felt like he had a scratch on his scalp and his wife told him that it looked a little swollen. He then reported that the rash on his scalp started to get more and more uncomfortable. When the patient came home on 10Mar2021 around 17:00 or 17:30, he removed his shirt and his wife looked at him and asked what it was. He then reported that the rash appeared on his neck and chin and showed up overnight or that morning. He then stated that the rash on his chin and neck was not painful or anything. The patient then stated that the rash on his head was getting pretty agitated as of 10Mar2021. The patient thought that the rash on his chin, neck, and chest was eczema or heat rash, but thought it was odd because heat rash is normally flat. When he woke up on Wednesday (10Mar2021), the rash was looking worse but was still not bothering him except for the rash on his head. He considered going to urgent care on Thursday (11Mar2021) but didn't follow through. On Thursday night to Friday night (11Mar2021 to 12Mar2021), he couldn't sleep. His rash felt like a sunburn or if like he was hit with a cactus, and the rash on his neck started to bother him. The patient went to urgent care on 12Mar2021, and when the nurse practitioner walked in, looked at him and said that it was shingles. The patient saw 3 people at the urgent care, a nurse, nurse practitioner and a resident doctor as a doctor was needed to confirm the diagnosis. All three of the staff members said that the rash was shingles where the rash was following a nerve pattern. The patient used a cream to treat the rash, he mentioned that he tried diphenhydramine HCl 2%, zinc acetate 0.1% (Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream, Topical Analgesic Skin Protectant; Lot 1790LZ/3, Exp: May2022) briefly on the back of his scalp for 1 night as it was starting to itch and feel weird. He mentioned that it did sting some but didn't think anything of it as sometimes the cream will sting when put over a scab. He also used Aquaphor Healing Ointment Baby Advanced Therapy (Exp: Aug2022, UPC: 0 7214063386 8; NART number 63386), taking slabs of it and putting it over the rash. He then stated that neither did anything. After going to the urgent care, he was put on antibiotics (late described as an antiviral that should clear up in 7 to 10 days since he was young and healthy) that day and essentially said there was not much he could do. The staff also recommended that because he had 6-month-old he should call his son's pediatrician but that his infant son should be okay. He followed up with his son's pediatrician and his doctor, who stated that it should be fine, just to minimize contact with his son. The rash was still visible on his chin, neck and chest. On his scalp was harder to see because of his hair. He stated that going on feel, outside of one spot it felt significantly better. He can now wash his hair and lay on that side of his head without pain. The rash on his neck looks like some are starting to scab over.  He reported that not one patch has disappeared yet, but his wife said that it was looking less red and inflamed. His doctor scheduled a routine blood draw for 08Mar2021 during his physical and stated that he was willing to go through test results as he was unsure what would be helpful, but there were numerous results for each lab test (CBC with auto differential, Lipid panel with reflex to direct LDL, Comprehensive metabolic panel, PSA, total, Urinalysis, and Vitamin D (25-hydroxy) total).  He reported that his doctor had sent him a message in the evening on 08Mar2021 that said ""results all normal"". The patient didn't require a visit to the emergency room but required a visit to physician office. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He stated that there was no history of his parents experiencing an adverse event with vaccines, just the usual sore arm, stuff like that.

A 60-year-old female received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: unknown, Expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered at an unspecified anatomical location on an unspecified date (age at vaccination was 60 years) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included she had an anaphylactic reaction twice in her life, once to macadamia nuts, and once to ""an allergy shot with dust stuff in it"". She had a complicated allergy history. Also reported allergies to corn and Benadryl and allergic to an ingredient in benadryl, originally reported as ""polypropylene glycol"", but later corrected to ""polyethylene glycol"". The patient was allergic to corn and poly-something in BENADRYL so she couldn't take it anymore. Co-suspect medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She stated that after the first dose, she had fever of 101F (her normal body temp is 96.8F), a rash on her forehead, and a headache, and noted that on the second day she 'had a little trouble breathing' but said it might be from seasonal allergies. Pretty normal reactions- her normal body temperature was 96.8F had a fever of 101F that's one of the regular side effects and a little bit of a problem breathing- on the second day. Rash on forehead right away, headache too. kept a cold compress and kept switching it every couple of minutes b/c of the fever little pustules. When she put the cloth on regularly it soaked her skin. Rash went away after she had 2 anaphylactic rxn - macadamia nut & allergen shot that had dust stuff in it. She treated the fever and forehead rash with cool compresses and kept switching it every couple of minutes, putting the cloth on regularly it soaked in skin and noted that the rash had what appeared to be 'little pustules"" and thought the rash may have been caused by the fever because they resolved at the same time. She had a side effect after the first dose of the vaccine. She asked whether she could receive the second dose and whether she should get the second dose. The nurse that gave her husband his shot said that the reactions to the second dose were more severe. She received the response stating that provided contraindications and discussed potential signs and symptoms of severe allergic reaction as listed in 'CONS-what are the risks of the vaccine (v5.0)' and when they would expect them to occur. Confirmed that fever was commonly reported and that common AEs were more frequently reported after dose 2 in clinical trials (Tables 1-4).  Referred caller to her HCP or vaccination site for additional guidance and monitoring. Confirmed that polyethylene glycol is an ingredient in the Pfizer Covid19 vaccine. She should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if she had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if she had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. They referred her to speak to her healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Her healthcare provider knew her health situation and had access to information that can better help inform that decision. The caller was unsure if she should take 2nd dose of COVID vaccine. Bendadryl no longer Pfizer but unclear when she developed allergy to it.

It was reported that, patient was reporting on herself and had a question. She got the first vaccine on 25MAR2021. She had the second dose on 15APR2021. She asked the doctor about it because she does have several autoimmune issues. She mentioned she had gotten a flu shot in the past but the flu shot made her unconscious. It had no after effect, and it did not do anything. She had not received the flu shot in the last 20 years and had not gotten the flu either. For the flu shot she didn't have the Lot, NDC or EXP. At that time, she was working in healthcare and made everyone do it. It was a fluke and no after-effects. She also mentioned she had lots of allergies. Anaphylaxis was a concern for her. With the first shot, she couldn't describe it, but first 10 to 15 seconds less than a minute started feeling dizzy but not really, states it was like when you first wake up from surgery where you are confused. It was an odd sensation. Then it went away. She didn't think much about it. She didn't even feel the needle prick then half hour later it felt like someone punched her 10 times, which lasted for two or three days. She decided to sit extra time in the waiting room area. She later confirmed later that this was regarding the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. She mentioned that she takes Tylenol on a daily basis but did not take it the day she got the vaccine. She went on to explain that she had a list of what to expect but the first dose it wasn't that bad. Within 8 hours of both vaccines experienced crazy fatigue and was so tired. She has joint pain normally and was in a flare due to psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis but after the vaccines the joint pain had increased. After a couple of days, it went back to how her pain normally was. Her main issue was with the second vaccine. The second shot on 15APR2021 did expect it to be worst. Dizzy: It went away. It was less than a minute and then it was gone. It happened while she was sitting in the seat. It was so strong and then it went away in a minute, it was gone. She felt like someone punched her ten times at the injection site: occurred with both doses, the first time it occurred starting 25MAR2021 She didn't even feel the needle prick, the injection itself did not hurt, then it felt like someone punched her hard 10 times. This started 20 to 30 minutes after getting the vaccine. When she got home no redness or really even swelling. Later confirmed no swelling. She had arm pain that lasted for 2-3 days and then it went away. The same thing occurred with the second dose on 15APR2021. Then it resolved on its own. She used icepack as a treatment. it did not kill the pain but made it more tolerable. She was just more sensitive. She confirmed that she recovered completely from the feeling like someone had punched her 10 times from both the first and second dose. Fatigue: It started 8 hours after vaccine on both 25Mar2021 and 15Apr2021. She thought she was home free. It was weird. She also mentioned with fatigue she started having a fever, muscle pain, and horrible joint pain all at the same time. They lasted 2-3 days and then she recovered completely.

She confirmed she recovered completely after both occurrences. Caller initially stated she was taking Tylenol and then later clarified she was taking CVS brand acetaminophen. She mentioned she takes this one because she had a lot of allergies and cannot take the regular Tylenol brand due to the fillers in it, Tylenol bothers her.

Joint pain: It started within the same time. Within 8 hours of both doses. She had joint pain every day but it amplified after vaccine doses. She felt disabled like she can't move. There was a difference. First time mostly was in her knees and hips. The second time it seemed to last longer, it aggravated the flare already there. She felt the pain in knees, hips, wrist, and elbows with second dose. States the wrist joint pain was really bad and she sometimes gets that with her rheumatoid arthritis but she was not having pain in arms, in her wrists and elbows before the injection. She has pain now but its the normal pain that she had felt prior to the injection. Lymph Node swelling: on saturday the 17APR2021 noticed her lymph nodes were swelling. She had a mammogram appointment. It was located under her left armpit. She called your doctor next day on the 18th because it was getting more painful. She was also having lymph nodes on the left side of the back of her neck that were swollen. That was part of the reason that she was calling because she wanted to see if that was normal. The lymph nodes swelling are all still there and they hurt. When probed for outcome caller did not clearly provide. She just mentioned that she was aware that it could happen under the armpit and figured that it would go away. But then she got one on the back of her neck which is also on the left side. She knows overtime that side effects have been added to our list. The doctors said if its persisting longer to call back and come in. Asked if it was normal. She did not have a cold or anything that would be causing it. she thought that the shingles vaccine was due next for her since she would turn 50, but she did not think she would get that.

With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything.

No adverse events following prior vaccinations were reported. It was reported that patient was calling about the COVID-19 vaccine.

Patient stated that she had a question. Ever since she took the COVID-19 vaccine she kept an ongoing rash. The odd thing was, the rash will turn up on any part of her body as a tiny red circle, like the size on a pin head. The rash was very intensely itchy. If she touched the rash, it opened and it bled. She did not know if this rash was coincidental after the COVID-19 vaccine so she was wanting to ask if this rash was in the range of common side effects. It was almost 2 months to the day since she had received her second COVID-19 vaccine. She reported her pajamas get bloody from her touching or scratching these spots. The spots were totally isolated. She got one on her eye lid last night and she knew not to touch it. She was never had anything like this before in her life. She had an extensive history of skin cancer. She got full body exams every 6 months and just had skin cancer removed 5 months before the present report. She never had anything like this rash until the COVID-19 vaccine. It was a mystery. She's recently moved from different areas and she's made every excuse as to why she had this rash. She was blamed the water and the fabric softener. She asked if the rash was a common side effect. She last saw her dermatologist in Feb2021 and her rash didn't begin until Mar2021. The itching was so intense and annoying. She had not seen her doctor or dermatologist since the rash appeared. She was calling Pfizer to make sure she had all the correct information before making an appointment with her dermatologist. She provided the following information in a historical context. She was providing this information because she was trying to rule out reasons she had this rash she was calling to report. She reported she was bitten by a tick about 5 months before the present report. This occurred prior to her receiving either COVID-19 vaccine. She had no circles at her tick bite. She did not think she had Lyme disease. She looked up the symptoms for Lyme disease. Even at the time the tick was removed, it was head stayed in her skin but she had no fever or exhaustion. She did not think her rash was residual from the tick bite. She did not feel afraid. She was not feeling any kind of discomfort. She got a little tickle like at her knee or somewhere on her body and the tickle turned into a red welt and started bleeding. It was very annoying. The rash could show up anywhere but not on the palms of her hands or on the bottoms of her feet. She was retired and she was living her new life. She was itchy all over and she tried not to touch the rash. She was hoping the rash would just resolve, it was very peculiar. She didn't feel real concerned because she had access to a good dermatologist. She was just trying to eliminate causes of the rash so she didn't waste her doctor's time. It seems like the doctor's only wanted to spend about 5 minutes with her anyway. She reported the rash started within a week after she received the second COVID-19 vaccine she believed. It started with the second vaccine, not the first vaccine. At her age she was trying to be orderly but she was still sometimes forgetful. Second COVID-19 vaccine given in the right arm on 09Mar2021, Lot number EN6198. She didn't even get a sore arm from the vaccine. Patient would like to know whether their side effects were related to the COVID vaccine.

They were usually singular and about 6 of them which are active. Sometimes it appeared on her toe, and sometimes on her eyelids Unsure if it was directly related to any vaccine as she had a few other changes recently such as moving from one area to another and also a tick bite but they have eliminated that as a cause.

The patient had no medical history.  The patient had no concomitant medications.

The device associated with Afluria Quadrivalent was Luer Lok syringe.   On an unspecified date in Oct-2018, unknown amount of time after vaccination, the patient experienced a frozen left shoulder, pain in the left arm and had limited range of motion and strength.  At the time of this report, the pain was improved, but the patient still had limited range of motion and strength. The outcome of 'frozen shoulder' was not resolved.   Product technical complaint (PTC) number 1055541 was assigned to this case.  Based on the Quality Assurance Investigation it was concluded that although a definitive root cause could be not determined as part of this investigation, there was no indication of a systemic manufacturing or syringe raw material defect.  It remains possible that the Luer Lock adaptor may had detached from the syringe as a result of the end user over-torqueing the needle into the attachment prior to administration and caused the Luer Lock to detach. To this, BD has provided a memorandum outlining recommendations for optimal syringe preparation.  This detached Luer Lock was unlikely attributed to a systemic manufacturing defect. On this basis, the final risk rating is 'Low'. Beyond the individual dose, the reported defect presents no residual risk to the remainder of the batch as is now expired and should no longer be available for patient administration. This was the only PTC for lot YF41208 and a detached Luer Lock for the NH 2018 - 2019 Influenza campaign. All material passed required testing against approved specifications for each component and was found to be satisfactory for use. There were no damages noted on the transport.

The nurse continued to give the full shot to the patient as the needle was already in his arm. The device assocated with Afluria Quadrivalent was luer lok. The batch number reported was P100257535.   The full dose was administered to the patient. There was no leakage and the vaccine were stored in the refrigerator, as reported.   The outcome of event 'laceration of thumb' was not reported.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Afluria Quadrivalent. The reporter assessed the events as related to device luer lok.   Quality assurance investigation (QAI) of Afluria Quadrivalent vaccine, batch number reported as P100257535, (PTC number: 1067455) determined the most probable root cause of broken finger flange on 1 syringe in Afluria_P100257535 in the 2020/2021 campaign was due to packaging equipment at the fill/finish facility. Shipping of the product was also a possible root cause for the event, as it could not be completely ruled out. Since the packaging line was the most likely root cause, the root cause had been assigned as 'Equipment Malfunction' and the complaint was justified.  Additional information received on 04-Dec-2020 from manufacturing quality assurance department: QAI provided. Reporter's information added. Narrative was amended accordingly.  Company comment: Skin laceration and syringe issue were associated with the use of Afluria Quadrivalent. Causality is assessed as unrelated for skin laceration since the injury was a result of broken glass of syringe. Syringe issue is also assessed as unrelated to Afluria Quadrivalent, per company's conventions. 'Laceration of thumb' and 'syringe broken' are assessed as related to device luer lok.; Sender's Comments: Skin laceration and syringe issue were associated with the use of Afluria Quadrivalent.

Syringe issue is also assessed as unrelated to Afluria Quadrivalent, per company's conventions.

I had taken a couple of regular strength Tylenol - a little before 06:30 pm mostly to prevent soreness in my arm. Around 7:15 or 7:30, I felt this wave of fatigue wash over me and I was chilled and I crashed on the bed - blankets around me with hot water bottle. Fatigue and chills lifted around 11 pm; headache, aches and sore throat remained. Around midnight, in addition, my chest started to tighten up again although not as bad as the first time; tooth pain and jaw pain and tingling down both of my arms. It was worse on the right. About 1:30 am on the 9th, the tingling started moving up over my scalp and over my head. My heart was pounding again and it was like having an anxiety attack without the anxiety. I had pretty much all the same symptoms as I had the first vaccine but it wasn't as bad - it was a milder version of them. I couldn't fall asleep until 07:30 am and slept until 2:30 pm and the symptoms persisted. Later that day, on the ninth, my lungs were off gassing chemicals it seemed and I felt it is a mist was going off in my brain. Both of these things, I have experienced before and they seem to be kind of random and they don't really have a cause for them. Same thing for the symptoms continuing - note on April 23rd - diminishing slowly. Heart pounding continued - Pulsometer showed it around 70 or so but it felt it was really pounding. I had the nausea, headache, sore throat, achiness, blah feeling - flu-like symptoms again - these would pop up randomly for a few days and then go away. They were gone when I saw my doctor on the 3rd of May but they had not been gone long. (So between the 23rd of April and May 3rd they went away.)

Lifting it forward showed no signs of pain. Then during the day and night, pain in both knees and ankles needing to hold the banister to walk up or down 1 step at a time.  Also developed swelling and in my lower legs. Bought special circulation knee high socks. Also pain in both feet. Went to the doctor and they prescribed medication I chose not to take. Opted for Tylenol 650 mg. I am not one to take medications, especially when they cannot determine the root causes. Dr. prescribed an ultrasound, right shoulder and also legs for circulation issues that I did not have before. I walk a lot in my job and do many physical tasks with no fatigue of pain before the vaccination. Am overweight but healthy and strong. I was a competitive bodybuilder in my late 20's and early 30's.

It has been over a month since my second dose of the Vaccine. As a note ... I had a fall at work in March where I injured my right hand, no fractures were noted in x-rays. Just a bone/muscle bruise in the thenar region. I went through physical therapy and after 3 weeks it healed. My 1st vaccine dose was March 9, 2021 and I chose to have the vaccine administered in my left arm. 800 Mg of Ibuprofen was given but stopped taking it by the time I had my first vaccine. No other complaints until after my 2nd dose in April.

The second dentist wanted me to come back after NOT taking any pain meds to make a definitive diagnosis.  So, I stopped taking pain meds and the dental pain wasn't coming back.

He stated the MD told him that ?he had several other issues with the shot so the MD said it was a ?bad batch??.  * I made sure that the patient was comfortable about getting the Covid shot and he agreed that he was fine to get it. At that time the patient did not seem overly nervous about receiving the shot.  * I administered the shot to the patient and he went directly to the seats next to the pharmacy. I asked him to stay there because he had a past issue with another vaccine.  * Approximately 2-3 minutes later, the patient came back, looked troubled and said he didn?t feel well and was feeling the same way as the other shot. I brought him back into the pharmacy immunization room, sat him down and put his head between his knees. I did a quick check on him to be sure he was breathing OK and that there was no apparent allergic reaction.   * After a minute I brought his head back up and put patient into regular seated position. At no point did he completely lose consciousness or faint. I asked him at that point if he wanted me to call an ambulance or a family member and he declined. He sat there in the chair for approximately 15 minutes- part of the time his head was in his hands, part of the time looking at his phone. He asked for a glass of water and I got him one (he had completely drank it by the time he left). I kept checking on him and it seemed like every time he saw me check on him he put down his phone and put his head in his hands again. He could have been embarrassed by the situation, unsure though. I tried to make him as comfortable as possible.  * After 15-20 minutes I asked him if he wanted me to call someone and he said at that point he wasn?t sure he wanted to drive home so he would call his mother to pick him up, which he did.  * I sat down with him for a couple of minutes and explained that this was called a vasovagal response and was quite common (I even empathized with him by explaining that I have the same response when I get blood drawn at the doctor?s office). He seemed to feel a little better after I explained it to him.  * His mother came in 15 minutes later and I brought her back as well. She explained the same thing happened at the MD office 4 years ago and that it was the Meningitis shot, not Tdap. I explained to them going forward that it would probably be best to get his immunizations at the doctor?s office so that he could lay down after the shot and they agreed.  * He and his mother then walked out of the immunization room and left the building. He left under his own power and without assistance from his mother.

Headaches began to get stronger and there was less time in between them; my right ear began to have intermittent fluttering inside; this went on day and night - I could not sleep with the severe headaches and the inner ear noise - both progressively got worse through 3/1/21 when I called ophthalmologist  and complained about my vision becoming blurry and blocked vision in right eye. 3/2/21 ophthalmologist appt revealed a retinal he. CONT: retinal hemorrhage in the right eye and a large floater break off tissue in same eye that  blocked vision.  She did not know if that was connected to the vaccine however I will note that at my annual eye exam with her last Sept 2020; I have NONE of these issues. She told me to come bck in 2 wks to see if bleed continues or gets absorbed and to contact my Doctor ASAP about the headaches as I was crying in pain while in her office. 3/3/21 I began an extremely severe headache @ 2:30 am, did not subside and was taking max amount of pain meds 6x 500 mgs of tylenol per day and 2x Naproxyn 500 mg 2x/day - called my cardiologist as her was the last Dr to see me in person on2/5/21 the week before my 2nd Moderna vaccine on 2/13/21 The triage nurse at the practice asked me questions, then said to come in at 4p, then my Dr heard, and said to come in ASAP - I got to his office at 11am; he came in exam room, took one look at me; and sent me to Hospital Emergency  Still, on 3/3/21, I went to ER with Dr having phoned them in advanced - I had a CT scan of the brain area - they tried IV pain meds but they did not work - they sent me home with referral to Neurologist. THIS WAS NOT MY CHOICE - I had to wait from 3/3/21 with referral from hospital to Dr  neurologist in the hospital system BUT Diagnostic would NOT allow me to make appt with him until they had another referral as well - You CANT make this  stuff up. Finally I had my cardiac Dr/Surgeon send their office a referral and was able to make appt. YES I SUFFERED GREATLY from 3/3/21 in the ER to 3/25/21 on appt day - I wanted and almost went to ER 2 other times inbetween but they couldn't do anything the first time that helped. 3/22/21 Followup appt with ophthalmologist, the retinal hemorrhage in right eye was being absorbed - good news, the floater was still an issue but nothing could be done. I filled her in on the ER visit etc. 3/25/21 First appt with Neurologist after exam and noting my timeline and ER results of which he had access to being with Hospital he prescribed the AMITRIPTYLIN and ordered 2x MRI's of my head. He suspected that this was an ""auto-immune"" response to the Moderna vaccine. He told me the medication would hopefully help the severity of the headaches and/or duration. Began that night taking the AMITRIPTYLIN and am still on it. 3/26/21, 2x MRI's of the head a Touchstone Imaging. 4/5/21 followup with Neurologist - the MRI's did not show any current clots in the large vessels; I still had headaches although they were hurting the AMITRIPTYLIN kept them tolerable and that medication also makes me drowsy and heavy sleep so I was much better off with the AMITRIPTYLIN as I could not function without it at all. The Dr wanted an additional 2x MRIs of the smaller vessels to completely rule out any clots that could be in those areas 4/6/21 2x MRI's of the smaller vessels at Touchstone Imaging  4/7/21 appt with my gastroenterologist [every  6 months] as one of my underlying conditions and reason for disability is idiopathic acute re-occurring pancreatitis [confirmed diagnosed 1997] this condition makes it difficult for me to digest many oral prescription medications so it adds a layer of difficulty in treatments not to ""induce"" a pancreatic episode.  My gastro Dr has had me as a patient since 1997 and knows me well - went over all the Moderna issues and he was ok with the meds. 4/8/21 call from Neurologist that the last 2x MRI's of the smaller vessels were clear - no clots - a HUGE relief - he said to continue the AMITRIPTYLIN which dulls the nerve sensing pain; saying being an ""auto-immune"" response, that IF this Moderna vaccine follows other types of vaccines auto-immune responses, that the severe headaches will hopefully subside from 4-6 months and that I would continue the medication until there are no further headaches. CURRENTLY - I have been taking the AMITRIPTYLIN since 3/25/21 - I still have some severe headaches ""push through"" However, they are intermittent - I cannot up the dose of the AMITRIPTYLIN as I am already having difficulties with the meds side effects, drowsy and sleepy, dry mouth and eyes, low energy, etc - there is no choice, the meds or crying with headache pain;  FUTURE I have 6/14/21 followup appt with neurologist - that will be the 4 month mark after Moderna 2 vaccine, I pray the  headaches are gone but as of now; they are still with me. OH note, as soon as I began the AMITRIPTYLIN, the ear fluttering  stopped within 2 wks, yay! I also have to carry water for the dry mouth and I use lubricating drops for the dry eyes.

1328221,05/18/2021,OR,57.0,57,,M,,"Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA For the first days following my 2nd shot my side effects where pretty standard.  I tinfoil taste in my mouth after the shot, I had numbness in my left arm during the first night, I felt light headed on the 13th and had a fever over 100 F that evening.  The 14th I was just sort of ""floaty"" and unfocused. I was fine while sitting, but if on my feet for more than a few minutes I got light headed and had to sit down.  By Saturday the 15th I was pretty much back to normal and felt normal on Sunday the 16th.  I went to work on Monday the 17th and worked a full shift from 5:00AM to 4:00PM without any noticeable side effects (maybe a bit higher fatigue than normal). On Tuesday the 18th everything went to (Bleep)  I had a normal start  arriving at work at 6:00AM and felt fine until about 7:30AM when I noticed that the panel I  had just taken out of my machine looked bent.  I grabbed a straight piece of wood to check it and it was straight.  I then noticed that the line of holes also seemed to bend, that shouldn't happen.  I raised my head and looked around a bit and noticed that everything looked a bit bent, sort of like looking through a fish-eye lens.  It was a mild bending, but there.  I took off my safety glasses thinking maybe they had gotten warped somehow, but it didn't change anything.  Shortly after this I started feeling dizzy and unsteady on my feet.  I reported this to my supervisor who told me to sit down and make sure to drink some fluids and rest during my 8:00AMbreak.  I took a granola snack bar during break and drank half of my thermos of water.  I sat for a good 10 minutes and started feeling better.  I walked rather unsteadily back to my station and finished the job I was running at the tool, sitting down after starting each piece and then standing up to pull it off when it was done cycling.  I got the job finished but still felt light headed and slightly dizzy.  My supervisor told me to go home and I clocked out just before 9:00AM  I went out to my car and rested for a few minutes then went over to the cafeteria to pick up my lunch and rested some more, then went back to the car.  I waited awhile to see if I still felt dizzy and then left at about 9:30.  The drive home is only 5 minutes, so I felt confident I would be OK as long as I took it slow and kept my vision fixed on the road directly in front of the car.  I arrived at home and checked over my Covid-19 EUA and decided to call my vaccination/healthcare provider.  They scheduled me to come in at 1:15PM and see the PA.  I had a light lunch at 11:15AM and then took a nap until 12:30PM.  My son drove me to my appointment, I was fine walking out to the car, and I didn't have any nausea or dizziness while in the car.  When I was first led in the assistant took my weight, pulse, and BP.  Surprise my blood pressure was 164/110!  I've had slightly high blood pressure before, that is why I am on Lisinopril, but it is very mild, this surprised me!  It apparently surprised the assistant as well since she took my BP again to be sure, and got the same result.  I then stayed seated and waited for the doctor.  She showed up a few minutes later and checked my blood pressure again.  This time it was normal.  Weird.   She checked my eye tracking and heart rate and looked in my ears.  General consensus is that it is high blood pressure and possibly inner ear.  Most likely related to my covid-19 vaccine.  She gave me a blood pressure monitoring sheet and told me to go home, rest, and drink lots of fluids. She sent a prescription for some nausea medication to my pharmacy (I haven't been to the pharmacy yet to pick it up). She will call me back to check up on me on Thursday after 4:00PM.  In the meantime, I am to check my BP three times a day and anytime I am having an episode, and write it down on the form she gave me.  I have a BP cuff at home, so no problems doing just that.  I wrote about my symptoms on my Facebook page and got a reply from my daughter that said she had blurred vision issues after her second shot that lasted for almost the whole week.  It may be something genetic.  My son had his second shot on the 16th at 12:45PM.  So far, other than a sore arm, he has shown no side effects at all.  He had the Pfizer vaccine, while I had Moderna.  It may have made a difference.

In Apr2021 the patient experienced vision changes in right eye/vision complications/getting a dark spot in the bottom part of the vision of his right eye, loss of his peripheral vision, the peripheral vision in his right eye was getting cloudy/eyes go in and out of focus while reading and his vision was getting a little worse. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient was a retired pharmacist who called to find out whether there had been any reports of vision complications after the COVID-19 vaccine. He received the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 15Apr2021 and as of about 2 weeks ago, the peripheral vision in his right eye was getting cloudy and the patient was getting a dark spot in the bottom part of the vision of his right eye. He did not know if Pfizer had any types of reports on that type of side effect. He made an appointment with his eye doctor for tomorrow, 04May2021. He wanted to have any information that Pfizer might have. He knew that his eye doctor was going to ask him questions to try to determine what was causing the vision changes. He wanted to check with Pfizer before he went to the eye doctor so that he had an answer to the doctor's questions. The patient reported that his vision was getting a little worse. He was now having a little trouble with the computer. He had to refocus every time he moved his eyes. Yesterday, 02May2021, he had what could have been a problem driving. He was driving on the highway and there was a lighted sign. He could not read the sign because it was on the right side of the road. By the time he could focus on the sign, he could not read it because he was right by the sign. Something like that could be a big problem. He reported that his eyes go in and out of focus while reading. He had to re-focus when he was going to the next line of text that he was reading. He just got an eye exam and new glasses in Feb2021. His problem in Feb2021 was with focus. He was having problems more or less with reading. In the bright light, everything was fine, but that in regular kitchen or incandescent light, he would only be able to read a paragraph or so. He would then have to refocus in order to read more. It became a real problem and the new glasses that he got were not solving it. The patient stated that the last Pfizer representative he spoke with said that Pfizer did not have any vision changes listed as a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine that the representative knew of. The Pfizer representative informed the caller that there may have been calls that have come in reporting vision changes, but vision changes were not listed as a side effect yet. The patient stated that he saw about 5 doctors. His primary care physician did not know about the vision changes as the changes had just occurred in the last 2 weeks. The patient had absolutely no reaction to either dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He did not even have a sore arm following the COVID-19 vaccine injections. The vision changes started about 2 weeks ago and he wanted to wait to see if it was going to clear up before he made appointments with his physicians. He reported that his vision did not clear up and that he was now getting concerned, especially with driving. The adverse events required a visit to the physician office. The clinical outcomes of the events vision changes in right eye/vision complications/getting a dark spot in the bottom part of the vision of his right eye, loss of his peripheral vision, the peripheral vision in his right eye was getting cloudy/eyes go in and out of focus while reading and his vision was getting a little worse were not recovered/not resolved. The patient reported that he did not believe (doubted that) that the COVID-19 vaccine caused his vision changes.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information available the changes in vision in this 84-year old patient is attributed to  patient's advanced age and assessed unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).",,,,,,,,,N,04/15/2021,04/01/2021,,Test Name: Triglycerides; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Low; Test Name: PSA; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:9; Test Name: PSA; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:3.1; Test Name: Total cholesterol; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:170,PHM,,FLOMAX [MORNIFLUMATE]; PROSCAR; LISINOPRIL + HIDROCLOROTIAZIDA; PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]; ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM,Blood pressure high (diagnosed with high blood pressure 12-15 years ago.); Eye disorder NOS (His problem in Feb2021 was with focus.); High cholesterol (he cannot remember when he was diagnosed with high cholesterol); Prostatic disorder (For probably 15 years.),Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Blood pressure abnormal; Heartburn,,USPFIZER INC2021493755,2,05/18/2021,,Y,,

The patient reported that recently, she received her COVID vaccine and about a month later, on 13Mar2021, she was hospitalized due to abnormal uterine bleeding. The patient has no significant medical history gynecologically, so she wanted to see if there was any correlation with receiving the vaccine and her abnormal uterine bleeding. The patient further stated that she was bleeding heavier than normal and was hospitalized because she had a heavy uncontrollable bleeding that started on 16Mar2021, and also had larger than normal clots, started on 15Mar2021, which presented like fibroids or endometriosis, however, she does not have any of these. The patient had three episodes. On 16Mar2021, the patient went to the emergency room due to bleeding. The patient was there most of the day and was sent home later on. On 17Mar2021, she went to the emergency room by ambulance and was admitted to the hospital. The patient lost so much blood that she had to have five transfusions. The patient was also treated with blood pressure medications because everything was coming out. While in the hospital, the patient had a uterine artery embolization. After discharge, she followed up with the gynecologist who followed her through the hospital. She had no gynecological history of any kind prior to this. The doctors were unable to give a definite explanation as to why this happened. It may have been hormonal at this time in the patient's cycle. She was over a year post-partum from having her last child and she had two C-sections with no issues. The patient stated that this could be completely coincidental. At the hospital on Mar2021, the patient had labs and an ultrasound. The results were in her patient portal online. She had blood work drawn a few days after hospital discharge ordered by the gynecologist and another blood work several weeks later, ordered by her primary care provider. The patient was placed on Iron 325mg by mouth twice daily and was prescribed pain medication, but the patient never took it. The patient was currently taking doxycycline 100mg tablets every 12 hours for inflammation response from the uterine artery embolization procedure that she had. The patient was unsure if this was coincidence or related. The vaccine was the only thing she can think of that may have been a contributing factor.

On 27Apr2021 the patient experienced had a blood clot in her lungs and she had tripped and fallen and on unspecified dates the patient experienced had headaches and felt nauseated. The course of events was reported as follows: ""After the second dose of the vaccine the patient felt fine, she felt pretty much okay. She attributed that to her having had COVID back in Dec2020 based on her biological knowledge. She ran this idea past a pharmacist that said that generally people might take the first dose of the COVID vaccine and be fine and then be worse on the second dose. But since she had COVID in Dec2020 her second dose of the COVID vaccine was the problem like how people's antibodies were already built up and had that reaction so that is why she was fine. She was walking out of the hospital on 27Apr2021, there were people that had crossed in front of them very quickly and her foot had hit the foot of a lady that was pushing a gurney. The patient tripped and fell down and she was taken to the emergency room. In the emergency room, a doctor did some tests and shockingly the doctor said that the patient had a blood clot in her lungs. A physician's assistant told the patient that she needed to have a computerized tomography (CT) scan done. The patient needed to go home to take care of responsibilities there, so she walked out of the hospital. She did not know if she had a blood clot in her lungs or not. Her doctor said that the blood clot in her lungs was based off of two blood values. One was the d-dimer that had a reference value of < 500 and her level was 1,079 and the other blood work was troponin-I but it looked like it should be in the normal range because her level was less than 0.03 and the reference range was 0-0.04, so she would think that she would fall into the normal range. The d-dimer one was kind of scary. She had other tests done. They did a regular complete blood count (CBC) on her, another kind of test and another set of blood values but from looking at the results she was only a little low on a couple of things. They did not do the test with the contrast, but they did take an x-ray of her lung. The technician had found out that she had not had a Computed axial tomography (CAT) scan in a while, since she apparently needed them periodically, and she felt uneasy because that technician was urging her to get a CAT scan. The patient she did not know if these results were relevant or from the COVID vaccine. She did not understand this but when she was looking at the lab notice there was a note that the patient should be monitored for B Type Natriuretic Peptide (b/np) levels. It had the reference range on that one but when she read it, it looked like hers lied within the normal range. After the second dose she just had a headache but did not feel sick, but a week later they were telling her that she had a possible blood clot in her lungs. The patient was concerned at this point because she had no reason as to why she would have a possible blood clot. When she gets exhausted her oxygen drops and sometimes it will without her being exhausted. She was scared to go back to that one hospital. She was thinking about going to another hospital that was 60 miles away. If they would need to keep her overnight, she would need to make arrangements for her animals. She has had headaches, but they may be due to stress. She did not feel sick, other than she had been nauseated. The patient stated that she was not saying that what was reported on report 1 of 2 was due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why would they say that she had a blood clot too.""

The clinical course as following: This past Wednesday was two weeks and then Thursday, her eyes started bothering her, the right eye. She thought it was seasonal allergies, because she has those, that kept bothering her and and she had a very runny nose. Saturday she woke up she felt like her face was kind of numb. She called the nurse and they told her she should go to the emergency room. She was diagnosed with bells palsy and so they gave her treatment and they explained to her what it was all about. She had been working out in the yard and she came in and her eye had a little burning sensation and was irritated. She thought it was because she was outside. She also had a runny nose. She says again, she thought it was seasonal allergies because she has that. Felt weird around her mouth, felt kind of numb: second dose: This past Saturday, she woke up and stated she felt weird around her mouth, it felt kind of numb, it was hard for her to drink, she couldn't smile correctly, her smile was lopsided, one side was droopy. Caller states this began 01May2021.  She went to the emergency room that same day and they diagnosed her with bells palsy. She was discharged from the emergency room because this time the lady doctor gave her the procedure with a stroke. The doctor could tell that it was not a stroke because of the eye, the doctor did something with her finger, they say can you see my finger, can you touch your nose. The doctor told her what she had is bells palsy and prescribed some medication.  The eye is worse, but she doesn't have a runny nose anymore.  With her eye, she can raise the left one, but the right one not as much. They gave her a patch for the right eye. She has to wear it in the evening, because it doesn't close anymore. She has to wear it to sleep with and during the day she has to wear glasses and if she goes outside, she has to wear sunglasses. Her eye is not really irritated, just kind of stiff, it does not really do much, she did some exercises to try to stimulate the muscles. The eye is just there, it doesn't really blink, it is beginning to blink a little bit but when she tries to close both eyes, she can close the left but it's like she can't completely close the right, she has no control of that part of the face, it's numb. She clarifies her eye started on Thursday 29 Apr because it was the first day she was outside. on the 30 Apr it was pretty red but she kept working. On Saturday morning she worked and she had a runny nose then too. Caller states they gave her some medicine at the emergency room. That night, she took Acyclovir and after she took the first one, she didn't have a runny nose anymore. Her eye is a different kind of bother now, it doesn't burn, its just there. They told her to get artificial tears and put the patch on. When asked if her eye is improved, persisted or worsened, she says the eye is not burning anymore, it's just kind of stiff. Bell's palsy: Caller states it's ongoing, when she smiles its the same. Caller states it's lopsided and when she raises her eyebrows, she can raise the left one, but the right one only goes up a little bit, but not as much. Caller states it's persisting, it's not getting worse, not getting better. Caller states she just started the medicine yesterday. Acyclovir: It was 400mg 5 times a day by mouth, one tablet for 10 days. Methylprednisolone:  the other thing they prescribed me was Methylprednisolone. She tried taking both the Acyclovir and the Methylprednisolone yesterday, but she had a really bad stomach ache and couldn't eat anymore. She had no appetite and her doctor, she told him she couldn't take both it is too much, so he just said she should continue the Acyclovir so she is not going to take the Methylprednisolone. The Methylprednisolone is a 4mg dose pack, 6 day thing. Yesterday she was supposed to take two before breakfast, 1 after lunch, 1 after supper and 2 before bedtime. She couldn't take all of that, it was too much. Today would have been different, it tapers off. The emergency room visit on 01May2021, they didn't do any testing, she just had observation. the doctor did this thing with her finger where she could see her finger and she pushed back and held onto the doctor's hands and showed her strength.  she raised her eyes, closed her eyes, smiled, but no other testing was done. she had her second emergency room visit on 01May2021.

A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 16Apr2021 10:00 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation.

The patient previously took morphine; he had a shot of morphine in the emergency room sometime before his COVID vaccine. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 25Mar2021 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility was PRIVACY she thinks. Prior vaccination (4 weeks prior) were none. The patient's sister reported that they both had their second dose and she forgot to tell the other woman she spoke to about herself because the caller's focus was on her elderly brother who was 72-years-old. They both received their COVID vaccines in the morning of 16Apr2021, a Friday, and within hours her brother felt very bad. She went downstairs and saw her brother vomiting in the trash can and he just said that he hurt and that he felt nauseated. This continued for a few days, in fact it continued for 4 days. He was beginning to feel better on Monday, but he was still not up to par. Then Tuesday she guesses her brother was feeling better. On Wednesday night she went downstairs and heard him around 2300 to midnight talking to the dogs and then the next morning she found him unresponsive (22Apr2021). Her first thought was that maybe her brother had a stroke so she called 911. In the emergency room he had a CAT (computerized tomography) scan and at first they said that he didn't have a stroke. But something very unusual was that her brother had a rapid heartbeat and his normal was around 60 but in the emergency room his heartrate was upwards to 120 to 130 to 140. He was then transferred to another hospital where they said the next evening that in fact he did have a stroke even though that first doctor said that he didn't have a stroke. The doctor didn't find any further information until 2 days later when the doctor thought her brother already had some blood clots that were thrown into the frontal, temporal and parietal region in his brain. She was a biologist so she can't say that the COVID vaccine caused this but she thought that Pfizer should be aware of his situation and then she was so focused on her brother that she forgot to tell the other woman the really bizarre things. She had asked certain questions to the doctor based on what her sister was telling her to ask. The caller asked the doctor if her brother was going to be seen by a neurologist and the doctor gave a rambling evasive answer and then turned on his heels and walked out and kicked her out of the hospital. They both had their COVID vaccines in the morning around 1000 or so and she doesn't know if he was vomiting still the next day or not but her brother felt really bad. He has chronic conditions and he generally just felt bad and he had thought that something was wrong with him. He felt malaise, fatigue, his head hurt and he was nauseated. He ate one bowl of soup that the caller had made for him but he wasn't really eating. That lasted for about 4 days and then he started to feel better on Tuesday, confirmed to 20Apr2021, and then he felt even better on Wednesday, confirmed to 21Apr2021, because the caller did take him on some trips. He doesn't drive. Her brother said that he felt feverish and the caller says that he felt feverish to the touch as well but the thermometer said that he didn't have a fever because it had an error sign when she took his temperature. Unresponsive: Her brother was fine Wednesday night around 2300, maybe midnight, she had heard him downstairs talking to the dogs and she knew that he was okay. Then the next morning, 22Apr2021, she found him slumped into his rollator (his wheelchair with a seat) and he was slumped over and had stuff that looked like had came out of his mouth and he had vomit on legs. He was unresponsive so she called 911 and said that she thought her brother had a stroke. The operator said to lay him flat and the caller was finally able to get him up and then his arm got hung up and the operator said again to get her brother on the floor and get him flat. She understands that this was important and she was able to do it but they all fell down, her brother, her and the rollator. Shortly after this the ambulance had shown up. The ambulance took her brother to the emergency room in town and they said that her brother's heartrate was fast. She gave them all of the relevant information but she didn't think to tell them about the COVID vaccine. They said that her brother's heart was acting eradicate and it was very fast. Again, his normal heartrate is in the 60s and it was going from 110 to 140s and it wasn't coming down. She told them that when he was unresponsive that she thought he was having agonal breathing. In the emergency room, her brother's breathing was still not very good and she heard the doctor say that her brother had stopped breathing but then he came back so that's when he was intubated in the emergency room. They did a CAT scan of his head and his neck and the doctor comes back and said that her brother didn't have a stroke. But that was not the case according to a different doctor's later assessment. Approximately around 1430 to 1445 on that Thursday, 22Apr2021, they transferred him to PRIVACY,  where he was in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). His heartrate conditioned to being very fast. He went from the emergency room to the ICU. Thursday when he got transferred to the ICU they didn't do any diagnostic tests that day, he was still intubated and his heartrate was still up into the next day, Friday, 23Apr2021. It wasn't until late in the afternoon that a doctor came in and said that her brother did have a stroke he has even had prior strokes too. They had done an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) on Friday of his brain, which was not what they did in the first emergency room, that showed that he had a stroke in his temporal, frontal and parietal regions of his brain. At first caller states that on Saturday, he opened his eyes but he was still unresponsive essentially but then she says that this statement was wrong because he actually didn't respond that quickly. He has gone into a coma once before and when he had came out of it a very unpleasant thing happened that was very personal so she was not going to tell it. On Saturday and Sunday the doctor didn't want to answer the callers questions, this was a different doctor than the first ICU doctor and this one didn't have good bedside manner. Finally on Monday, 26Apr2021, her brother started responding. He was moving his legs with purpose, he had tried to kick the nurse, and he had made some words. The day before this, on Sunday the caller had brought the priest in to bless her brother and he sort of nodded and he seemed to make movements but he was still not able to talk. Monday he said what sounded like words and then Tuesday he made, what seemed to her like, meaningful statements. She was told that he had an ultrasound of his neck to see if he had any clogged arteries or veins and the nurse said that the test results came back good that their were no clogs. But this was where the whole story just becomes awful. Caller discusses how there were issues with a cousin having power of attorney from 2015 that was supposedly no longer valid according to the caller and she had spoke with administration and then she got kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday because of a question she had asked the doctor about her brother seeing a neurologist. The doctor said that the neurologist makes his own schedule and it might be 10 days or more if he even decided he wanted to see her brother. When the doctor asked the caller how would she like her brother's care to be she mentioned that he was in a coma before and was being treated for similar circumstances from PRIVACY and that he was seen by a neurologist and she said that maybe her brother should be seen by PRIVACY and the doctor walked out and within minutes she was being escorted out of the hospital for belittling the doctor and calling administration. Now they won't even let flowers be delivered to her brother. Unfortunately the person who has been involved with him the most, the caller, was now barred from him. She was not saying that this was all due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why were they saying that she has a blood clot too. She has had headaches but they may be due to stress. She didn't feel sick like her brother. She has a question and she was really scared about the answer. She was just now reading that if you're on immunosuppressant drugs then you're not supposed to have the COVID vaccine. She asked was that true. Well her brother was in remission for leukemia and he was on a cancer medication called imatinib. Caller declined to speak to medical information about this and says it was already too late because he was already taking it and she doesn't know why he didn't stop them. Her brother's friends have tried to call and they were all getting the same statement, which she believes the hospital was stone walling, but the hospital says that they don't have a patient by his name and they have even told the florist the same thing. So caller was unsure if her brother has been discharged or not. He didn't seem to be in the shape to be shipped to a care facility but she doesn't know. It was hard for her to piece it all together. The hospital wasn't feeding her brother enough before she left so for all she knows they could be starving him to death and holding nutrition from him. History/ Investigations: His medications were ones that he has been taking for years and she doesn't know exact start dates for any and if she needs to she can get the dosage information from the pharmacy. Her brother has hid his pills before and he puts them in different bottles, it was a nightmare. He takes a gout medicine and she doesn't know the name of it. Those were the main ones that he takes other than the cancer medicine she said earlier. And he also takes gabapentin for some of his neuropathic pain and he takes something at night and a few others she thinks. For medical conditions the only thing that she knows was that many years ago he had a blood clot but she can't really say what year it was. She does know that her brother wasn't on any blood thinners to he knowledge and not long ago he had an ultrasound of his legs to determine if he had a blood clot but she was not 100 % sure if he had that but she thinks he did. Her brother told her that years ago he had blood clots that were due to weight lifting causing varicose veins and later they collateralized and they found out that the other secondary vessels took over for pumping his blood so it wasn't a problem. Her concern was can someone from Pfizer talk to her about what's going on with her brother, she knows Pfizer doesn't have his records but how will Pfizer be able to determine if this was from the COVID vaccine. She guesses that she was curious about what may of caused the blood clots. She mentioned the COVID vaccine to one doctor and he didn't seem like she respected her knowledge. She asked was there anything that can be done to help her brother if it was a blood clot. She was upset that the hospital and her wanting her brother to see a neurologist and beginning with a claim that he didn't have a stroke and then a claim that he did. She thinks that they were not doing enough for her brother and they were just saying oh well, it was all due to a fast heart rate which can happen as a result of the COVID vaccine. She was going to be honest, she was exhausted and she can't keep talking for a long time. She asked if she can call medical information back later when she was more refreshed. Consumer further stated that her brother had complaints of feeling ill, feverish and having no appetite. Caller stated that the next Thursday she found her brother unconscious, heart rate was elevated 120 to140 beats per minute and that her brother had a stroke. The outcome was recovered on 21Apr2021 for the events Malaise, Nauseated, Fatigue, Headache and Appetite absent; recovering for the event Vomiting; and unknown for the rest of the events.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right upper arm on 27Apr2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EWO171; Expiration Date: Aug2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history including hearing was about 80 percent in the left ear/loss of 20-30 percent which started 10 years ago when the patient was 51. The patient has no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. After receiving a dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 27Apr2021, the patient experienced hearing loss in his left ear, it was barely noticeable but today (04May2021 12:00) there was a dramatic shift and he experienced hearing loss on both ears, it was instantaneous. The patient wanted to know if there are any reports of hearing loss and when could it go away. He has a hearing issue in his left ear that he has had, his hearing was about 80 percent in the left ear and in the right ear it was a 100 percent. Today, at noon he has almost lost his hearing in his left ear and his right ear seems like there is water in there or it is underwater. His left ear sounds like everything is echoing but, he can hear the call handler just fine. His right ear was perfect and now it is messed up. He is worried about that. The patient wonders why that happened and why did they both go. He reported that the shot may have had something to do with it and if it does, what should he do or maybe he is just getting old. He cannot hear in the left ear much; he was just testing it while on hold listening to the music to see how much he had. He felt like there is water in it, not a little, a lot of water and it echoes a little bit and seemed like it's underwater. Started 10 years ago when he was 51, he lost 20-30 percent and it stopped as far as he could tell. He did not get checked out then because he could hear clearly. Today at 12 pm, and it was not gradual, it was like turning a light on, immediately things were muffled. Even when he was putting his hands over his ears, there was like an echo. He was on the phone with his wife at the time. He did not know what happened, so, he went to work, and nothing is changed. He told her something just happened to his ears. He thought of doing something in the meantime and not trying to wait for it to get better. Right ear feels like it is underwater, maybe the left ear is affecting the right the or the weaker ear is being affected more. The right ear is the stronger ear over the left ear. That is what bothering him. His weaker ear is being affected more than his good ear, which his right ear has always been the stronger ear and he never had problems before with his right ear. It was a dramatic switch today at 12pm and his ears have been that way ever since. The left ear feels like its underwater, so much even if he blocks that ear with his finger or his palm. Still there is something going on in both ears. He did not notice the right ear because the other ear was such a shock and he was just dealing with that. He noticed the right side too after trying to see if he could hear out of the left. He had no baseline to go off of for sure or a history. No baseline to go from other than this hearing change of event, which may be totally him. He wanted to see if there is anything related to this because it was so dramatic.

At the ER they admitted me to the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days with hemolytic anemia. After a lot of testing and ruling out any infections, they discovered I have a rare blood disorder: hereditary elliptocytosis. The pfizer vaccine created an immune response and since I have this blood disorder I was predisposed to this event occurring from the vaccine (hemolytic anemia/juandice) without knowing it. It was a result of the vaccine. I was told to not get the second shot because there is no guidance, but that I am a high risk individual now.

Pt agreed and came back to sit down with me in the vaccine clinic.  Dr. was called and I spoke to him reviewing the aformentioned event to inlcude the patient's VSs. He agreed that when blood pressure initially 191/109 she should've gone to the ER. He then said since the BP was now192/85 that he was okay with her leaving, driving herself back home and seeing him at 1830 tonight, where he would address her hypertention.  Pt was then with steady gait and back to baseline, per friend, escorted back to waiting room nd to her car, where she stated she was going to drive directly back to home.

During night between 16th May and 17th May, I developed these shingles rashes.   I had first dose of Astrazeneca vaccine (called Covishield) on 14th April 2021. Nearly a month later I developed shingles. I am Type-2 diabetic for the last 20 years with excellent control and no organ damage so far. Still on 2500 mg metformin chloride per day and 10 mg Jardiance per day. I also have high cholesterol and high triglycerides since 15 years and I am on 10 mg Crestor a day. I also suffer from Hashimoto hypothyroidism (an auto immune condition) since 15 years and take about 70 mcg of levothyroxine a day. I am otherwise a fit person with regular exercise and a BMI of 20.5. I have been taking Vitamin C 500 mg for last 20 years, and regularly take Zinc and Vitamin D. Vitamin D level 60 ng/ml.  Looks like Covid vaccine induces shingles in people with auto immune disorder that was not thoroughly checked and studied due to urgent need of vaccine roll out. If stress reduces immunity and is the reason for eruption of shingles, I have been suffering stress from the last one year due to job loss and threat of job loss. But why Shingles erupted only after Covid vaccination? I should have suffered it earlier! It takes two weeks for covid vaccine to become active which could have caused body to fight it and thus lowering immunity. May be immunity is lowering more than necessary when compared to other vaccines. Advantage is taken by shingles virus due to this lowered immunity and causing shingles.  I have never suffered chickenpox during my entire life as I could have been vaccinated as a child for chickenpox. But I still got shingles now after Covid vaccination.   Four years ago, due to job requirements, I had to take multiple vaccinations such as rabies, etc. At the time I did not suffer shingles? But now only after Covid vaccination from Astrazeneca! Seems quick rollout of vaccine has created additional problems for certain groups of populations.  Luckily, I began treatment within 24 hrs with antiviral medication. My friend suffered from shingles 5 years ago. He complained about terrible shooting pain which is the case with shingles it seems. Surprisingly, so far I have not had any shooting pain, no itching, etc. A mild discomfort and a slight burning sensation on upper left chest, left back where shingles formed. But it shingles as confirmed by doctor.

Shortness of Breath        History of Present Illness   Patient is a 64 y.o. yo female presenting to the ED with shortness of breath.  Patient has history of COPD and asthma.  She uses inhaler daily and also uses nebulizer as needed.  She got her first Covid vaccine on March 1.  Approximately 6 days later she spent a significant amount of time around her son-in-law who unknowingly at that time had Covid.  She presents today with worsening shortness of breath, nighttime chills, productive cough.  She also feels that she has been wheezing and using her inhaler recently.  She is concerned that she potentially has Covid and that she may have a more severe version because she got the vaccine and was exposed to someone at the same time.  She endorses some vague right-sided chest pain that is only present while coughing.  Patient is Spanish-speaking only so translator is used for history gathering.        Medical Decision Making     Patient presents emergency department complaints of shortness of breath.  Recently got first vaccine for Covid but shortly thereafter was exposed someone with Covid.  Has been coughing, having nighttime chills, and chest pain with coughing.   Bedside exam reveals stable vital signs other than tachypnea.  Pulmonary exam does reveal diffuse rhonchi and wheezings.  Heart is regular.  Abdominal exam is benign.   We will get CBC, BMP.  Check chest x-ray and EKG.  Will give patient DuoNeb and steroids.  Will check a Covid swab.

Diffuse bilateral Covid 19 pneumonia as described. Pulmonary Artery Embolism: None. Cardiomegaly: None. END OF IMPRESSION: INDICATION: Ataxia, cough. Assess for pulmonary artery embolism. TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scan chest is performed per pulmonary embolism protocol, after IV contrast administration, using 2.0 mm intervals reconstructed in axial plane. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images are also obtained. Post processing 3-dimensional volume rendered views are created at an independent workstation, under concurrent supervision, and subsequently sent to the PACS system.   CONTRAST:  80mL of IOHEXOL 350 MG IODINE/ML INTRAVENOUS SOLUTION administered INTRAVENOUS. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from earlier today. FINDINGS: On soft tissue windows, there is adequate contrast opacification involving the pulmonary arterial system. Mean Hounsfield units of the pulmonary artery measure 293. This is best seen on axial series 402, image 65. There is no convincing evidence of an underlying intraluminal filling defect, to suggest pulmonary artery embolism. There is no thoracic aortic aneurysm or thoracic aortic dissection. There is no mediastinal hemorrhage. Mild to moderate ASCVD. Calcified plaque involving the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. Post processing 3-dimensional volume rendered views best demonstrate the degree of calcified plaque. Left chest wall cardiac device. Leads terminate in the right atrium, right ventricle. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pericardial effusion. There is no axillary or intrathoracic adenopathy. Limited images to the upper abdomen demonstrate small hiatus hernia. On lung windows, imaging findings are consistent with Covid 19 pneumonia. This is identified with peripheral groundglass parenchymal opacities. This involves approximately 50% of the lung parenchyma. Lungs otherwise clear. Central airways are patent. There are no endobronchial lesions. On bone windows, no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.

It began 1-1/2 weeks ago with her crying and her watch that her heart rate was 208.  They went to the ED, where she was given some fluids and her heart rate improved so she was sent home.  She had had prior episodes of mild tachycardia up to the 140s in the past but which has always improved with fluids.  Mom states that she used to have a lot of trouble maintaining her hydration and would not drink a lot of water.  Since the last 1-1/2 weeks, she has been having these episodes 1-2 times a day that last about 1 to 2 minutes with a max of 5 minutes.  When it comes on, she feels dizzy and lightheaded, and after the episode she feels a big rush of blood to her head.  She also has some associated shortness of breath.  She denies having any episodes of chest pain at all.  She has never passed out, she has never felt like she was going to pass out, she has never felt like she was out of balance.  She denies any nausea or vomiting during episodes.  She denies any headaches during the episodes.  She does have history of migraines, but has not had one in the last couple weeks.  Her prior resting heart rate was in the 80s per her watch, and lately it has been in the 110s to 120s while awake in 80s while asleep.  Along with the episodes, she also feels some pulsating sensation in her abdomen.  She does not have any abdominal pain.  Today, her heart rate was again in the 200s, but it was worse than before because it lasted about 30 minutes total.  Lately they have been using an app that continuously monitors her heart rate.  Since these episodes started, she has cut down on her caffeine intake and she has increased her water intake.  Does not feel that this helped.

1331005,05/19/2021,OR,53.0,53,,F,,"I received a flu vaccine at a drive-thru vaccine clinic on Friday, October 9, 2020 at approximately 5:15pm, sponsored by my insurance provider. I was sitting in the driver?s seat of my car and the nurse who administered the shot was standing up outside of my car. I received the shot in my left arm. By Sunday afternoon, October 11, 2020, I had a very sharp stabbing pain in my left shoulder. I first noticed it when I was outside with my son and we had to stop the activity we were doing. It hurt so much when I moved that I screamed out in pain. It felt as though part of my shoulder was out of place, and I kept asking my son what injury I was not remembering. I also remember specifically wondering out loud with him if my vaccine may have had something to do with it. Over the course of the next two weeks, the pain intensified greatly, and little by little I seemed to lose my ability to move it. I started icing it, and was working on massaging it, thinking I could move whatever was out of place back where it should be. A week or two after my vaccine seemed to be the height of the pain ? I am not a medicine person at all; however, I was taking ibuprofen several times a day hoping for some relief. At that time, I was only able to lift my arm as high as the kitchen counter and had a lot of difficulty getting dressed. For the next couple of weeks, I continued to medicate and massage, and I started to do my own stretching. My son often helped me as I couldn?t move my arm very much on my own. Sometimes it seemed to offer some relief in the moment and there were hours of time when I thought perhaps things were getting better. Finally after weeks of trying to assist through my pain and lack of movement, my son convinced me to reach out to my doctor?s office to get an appointment. It had been a month since the beginning of symptoms at that time. There was a height of pain and ?frozen-ness? at about week two, followed by a plateau. The pain and range of motion have not changed since that time, despite my self-recovery attempts. PRESENT CONDITION: There is a constant throbbing pain in my shoulder, with intermittent stabbing pain depending on how I move and which direction my shoulder is facing at the time of my movement. Because I have been in pain for many months, the muscles and nerves in my entire upper body are on high alert and are also constantly throbbing ? from my neck, down my left arm, and across my entire shoulder blade area. With my arm out straight, I can only raise it to shoulder level at this time (whether in front of me or to the side). I can only raise my left hand about 6 inches above my head. If I am trying to reach behind my back with my left arm, I can only reach as high and as far as my left back pocket. I had an in-person with a doctor on Friday, April 30, 2021 and was diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis (commonly referred to as frozen shoulder). I have my first appointment with physical therapy on June 1, 2021, so until that time I am continuing to exercise my shoulder as I am able to, treat it with heat and topical ointments, and using hot water and ibuprofen to ease the pain. I am taking cyclobenzaprine periodically to ease my muscles at night and help me sleep.  It is unknown at this time whether the pain will subside and I will regain mobility, or if this is something I will be dealing with for the rest of my life.",,,,,,,,,N,10/09/2020,10/11/2020,2,X-ray of left shoulder was taken on 4/15/2021.
