I kept checking my left rib cage and my left thumb as I was sure there was going to be hives, because I could not stop rubbing or scratching them as they itched so badly.

There was about a two inch area of my throat in which I felt I needed to keep trying to clear something that was stuck. (This made no sense to me as I was able to drink water without any issues.)

He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient's sister is here and she is a registered nurse.

History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -> 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.",,,,,Y,3,,,N,03/24/2021,04/02/2021,9,"########################### 04/02/2021 18:06 PROCEDURE: CT ANGIO CHEST FOR PE  CLINICAL INDICATION:  COMPARISON: CT chest 3/31/2021, 5/3/2017  TECHNIQUE: Helical CT was performed from lung base to apices, using 65 mL ISOVUE 370 intravenous contrast, without complication. MIP and coronal & sagittal MPR images were generated and reviewed. (DFOV = 380 mm)  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: Image Quality: Enhancement: Excellent Breath hold: Acceptable Other factors that limit exam quality: None Overall exam quality: Excellent, optimal for diagnosis  Findings: Pulmonary artery size: Normal Pulmonary embolism: None  CHEST: Lower Neck & Thyroid: Unremarkable.  Lungs: Redemonstration of focal areas of groundglass opacity predominantly in the bilateral upper lobes. The right upper lobe focus of groundglass attenuation has increased in consolidation. Progression of right upper and right lower lobe pulmonary consolidation..  Central Airway: Patent.  Pleura: No pleural effusion, thickening or pneumothorax.  Thoracic Aorta & Great Vessels: Normal in diameter. No atherosclerotic calcification.  Heart & Pericardium: No detectable coronary arterial calcification. Unremarkable cardiac morphology and pericardium.  Lymph Nodes: Stable large right hilar lymph nodes.  Mediastinum & Esophagus: Unremarkable.  Thoracic Spine & Chest Wall: Unremarkable, with normal thoracic vertebral body heights. No destructive lytic or sclerotic lesions.  Other Lines/Tubes/Devices/Hardware: None.  Visualized Upper Abdomen: Geographic hypoattenuation of the right hepatic parenchyma, similar to prior, is likely perfusional. There is cholelithiasis.  _______________________________  IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary emboli.  2. Scattered areas of consolidation in the bilateral lungs, mostly similar to prior, compatible with an infectious/inflammatory process and patient's known history of COVID. There is slightly increased consolidation in the right upper and lower lobes. A component of superimposed bacterial infection is possible as in several locations this consolidation is not groundglass, which would be more typical for uncomplicated COVID infection.  ###############    CHEST RADIOGRAPH, SINGLE VIEW, 4/2/2021 17:24  CLINICAL HISTORY: Chest pain  COMPARISON: Chest radiograph 3/31/2021  IMPRESSION:  1.

Then, much like my first shot, the pain in my shoulder started to drastically intensify.  Around hour 13, I started to get chills. Intense chills that lasted throughout that night. I had a temperature between 100 and 101. Chills, sweating, and slept fitfully, up and down all throughout the night.  Then I woke up the (Saturday) morning after my second dose, and I began to have very intense stomach cramping that was very debilitating. It felt like an awful kind of heartburn. The chills are gone. I still had pain in my shoulder. I was curled up in a ball, then stretching out my body, just trying really to not be in intense, intense pain. Finally, beginning around 1:30 PM on Saturday the pain started to very slowly lessen.   By about 5 PM I could say the stomach cramping/heartburn kind of pain was almost fully gone.  I woke up on Easter Sunday feeling still like my shoulder hurt, but all the other very very intense pain and symptoms seem to be almost entirely gone ? Well, except the headache that I really hadn?t cared much about while my stomach was cramping. But the headache had been present all day Saturday as well.   Saturday and all day Sunday, I had but one of my girlfriends describes as a ?hangover headache.?  I would say it?s something like when you have a couple glasses of wine where the tannins don?t agree with you. That lasted all this two days.   Sunday evening my shoulder pain started to increase and really really started affecting the muscle connecting my neck to my shoulder, I think it?s called the trapezius. As it intensified, I started feeling numbness in my fingers as we were trying to rub it away. I?ve had really bad knots in that muscle in the past, so the numbness didn?t scare me. The muscles in my left arm continued to cramp and just really hurt. All the way from my trapezius and the side of my neck on that side down through my bicep. And when I say cramping muscles and feeling like they?re knotted, the only way I can think to describe it is to say that they were SCREAMING.   I tried everything I could think of, but nothing helped. Finally I used an ice pack which worked for about 20 to 30 minutes and then I used a heating pad which also worked but not for very long. At this point I was just hoping I could sleep.  Around 12:30 AM, I was finally able to somewhat drift to sleep after getting in a manageable position, I guess. I woke up every hour or two in screaming muscle pain. And I woke up for good just before 6 AM today, Monday.

Around 2:30am the morning after the shot, I was awakened from a deep sleep by chills and sweats, which lasted for about 36 hours from that moment. These were moderate to severe, such that these symptoms alone would have prevented me from making it through the workday. However, things got worse. Due to chills and sweats, I took my temperate, which was about 99F at that time. Over the course of the next 10 hours the temperature spiked to 100.4F oral.  I tried to go back to sleep at 2:30am, but I could only toss and turn due to the chills. Perhaps due to lack of sleep, perhaps due to vaccine, I developed a head ache  and some nausea - both of these are extremely rare symptoms for me, as I rarely have a headache more than once a year. By 5am, with climbing temp, sore arm, headache, upset stomach, chills, sweats, muscle aches and exhaustion, I consulted my boss - a 20 yr clinical pharmacist - who advised me this would end after 24 hours. Therefore, I took no meds and waited it out.  Soon after 12:30pm, when the fever reached 100.4F, I felt the temperature break. It was almost 24hrs to the moment, and after that the symptoms began rapidly resolving. The temperature subsided completely by about 7pm that evening. Chills and sweats the next morning. Some fleeting headache and nausea the following day. A lot of dizziness and faintness over the next week or so, which I am unsure about - but it could be some sort of backup/accumulation of high dose Mg for my back, in the presence of the vaccine and/or immune response.  I say below that I visited the doctor because, if my boss were not a clinical pharmacist, I would absolutely have made a doctor's appointment.  Because I get COVID19 tested at work, I had no need to make an MD appt.  I got COVID tested, and I consulted with a clinical COVID19 expert - better than a doctor's visit given how long it takes to get in to see my PCP and how little he knows about COVID19  vaccine responses.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/19/2021,01/20/2021,1,"Only the temperature, which I took using oral route, home thermometer.",PVT,,Metagenics Inflavanoid Intensive  Care 2capsBID Metagenics Myocalm Plus 2tabsBID,,Sciatica,,,2,04/05/2021,,Y,,

1169511,04/05/2021,CA,32.0,32,,F,,"I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time",,,,,,,,Y,N,01/31/2021,01/31/2021,0,Just the treatment stated above.

On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS.

1169938,04/05/2021,,58.0,58,,F,,"Monday, April 5, 2021    Thank you for this opportunity to share my experience. Healthy, no underlying conditions, active, On Saturday, March 27th at around noon, I had my 2nd Pfizer vaccine, administered in my right arm at the  The injection was painless, I had zero symptoms initially following the injection and none the rest of that day.  On Sunday, upon waking, my arm was uncomfortable but not painful. No symptoms on Sunday.  On Monday, upon waking, my arm was more uncomfortable, I felt a little off; minor headache, minor light headed feeling, so I took 2 Tylenol.   On Tuesday, upon waking, my arm was very painful at the injection site. It was difficult to raise my arm above my shoulder.  I did not take any Tylenol although I still felt a little off. I massaged the injection site. We have a brand new 2021 hot tub that we use daily so I got in and positioned my right arm injection site on a bubbly jet to massage the area. It helped alleviate the severe pain and muscle stiffness.   I had an English muffin, 1 poached egg and banana, I showered, got dressed and my husband and I went to the bank and to store. While in store, around 12:30 ? 1:00 PM, I began to feel light headed, very hot; not a fever hot, just very temperature hot. I told my husband I needed to leave NOW. He got me a cold water and we left.   Upon arriving home ? say 20 minutes later, I was very light headed and nauseous. I went directly to bed to lie down.  By 2:00 PM, my nausea was extreme as I laid in bed. I knew I would feel better if I could throw up, but I also knew I would have to make my self do it because it wasn?t happening on it?s own.  I went to the bathroom and began to put my finger near my mouth and that?s all it took and I violently vomited 3 times.  The vomit was liquidy, and old blood red. Remember, for breakfast I had had a dry English muffin, poached egg and banana. NOTHING red!  I screamed for my husband who came in and was shocked to see the color and volume of vomit. He helped to clean me up and help me back to bed, where I immediately returned to the bathroom with severe diarrhea?the same old blood red color.  Again, he helped to clean me up and help me to lie down.  He got me cool water which I sipped.  Within an hour, I rushed back to the bathroom and VIOLENTLY threw up again. Severe convulsions, unable to breath in between each convulsion.  Old blood red, liquid, and to make matters even worse, the same color liquidy diarrhea. This went on for another 20 minutes.  My husband was with me the entire time as the extreme convulsions contorted me and I could not keep aim to the toilet. I thought I had internal bleeding and was dying! I have never been this sick!!!  Again, he cleaned me up, helped me back to bed where I was exhausted. He encouraged me to sip cool water which I did.  On Wednesday morning upon waking, I was less nauseous. My husband urged me to try a dry English muffin (my normal morning routine). I was able to eat a few bites and keep them down. I showered to clean myself up and that did me in. I made it to the couch for the day. Sipping water and trying to complete the dry English muffin. On Wednesday I did not have a bowel movement.  On Thursday morning upon waking, I was less nauseous and was able to drink a cup of tea and finish a dry English muffin. On Thursday I did not have a bowel movement.  On Friday morning upon waking, I was not nauseous. I was able to drink a cup of tea and finish a dry English muffin and 1 poached egg. On Friday I did not have a bowel movement.  On Saturday, now 1 week following the injection, I was better. Able to shower, able to eat, able to get out of the house. I had a small bowel movement that was the same dark color but somewhat in tact.  On Sunday, Easter, I felt really good. Ate breakfast, lunch and dinner. Had a better bowel movement; not dark but ?my? normal color and condition.  My theory (and I am not a scientist or medical person in ANY way!!!). When my arm was SO painful at the injection site and I got in the hot tub and placed my arm on a bubbly jet, it?s like I released the full burst of vaccine ? like a bolus ? into my system, rather than letting the muscle spasm release allowing the vaccine to gently circulate through my body.  In July and I can assure you that in my all of my years of owning this body, I have NEVER experienced any flu or sickness with this severe or this violent convulsing vomiting and NEVER experienced the color of the contents!!!!  My husband, with no underlying conditions, has also had both of his shots. He had no side effects. Yeah!!  Since this experience, I have not been able to drink coffee or wine, of which both were a regular part of my diet.   Now on a lighter note, less coffee and wine isn?t a bad thing, however since this episode I cannot fathom the thought of either of those entering my system.  Thank you again for this opportunity to share my experience. I am glad to have both shots and I hope I am NEVER this sick again!!!!",,,,,,,,,Y,03/27/2021,03/30/2021,3,,OTH,,,None,None,,,2,04/05/2021,,,,None

Pharmacy performs an inventory count at the beginning and the end of clinic to reconcile the number of doses dispensed/administered and the # of unopened vials that remain.  At the end of clinic on 3/31/21 when pharmacy was reconciling the vials remaining it was noted that there was an extra vial of Pfizer Covid Vaccine that did not reconcile with the # of doses dispensed and administered.  After investigating it was discovered that a Pfizer vaccine vial was used/reconstituted twice.  Therefore it was determined that of 98 patients, 6 patients received normal saline instead of Pfizer Covid Vaccine. This included 90 second doses and 8 first doses. It is not possible to know which of the 98 individuals received the vaccine or normal saline.  After consultation with the Department of Health and the CDC's Vaccine task force, it was determined that the best course of action is to offer all 98 vaccinee's the option to repeat the vaccine dose.   We will be offering vaccinee's an additional dose of Pfizer or J&J/Janssen at an interval of 21 and 28 days, respectively.  This is being done by direct notification of the patients via phone call describing the error and the optional recommendation for repeating the dose. Providers of the patients have been notified. All vaccinees will be informed of the potential of  experiencing more pronounced side effects with an additional dose. For patients who decide to receive the extra dose, the previous dose will be removed from the Registry.   The root cause analysis of this event revealed that the incident was related to a pharmacist not discarding a used vaccine vial as soon as it was used.  Pharmacy implemented corrective action plan, which included reeducation to all preparing vaccine and new measure to assure pairing of one vaccine vial with one normal saline vial for each set of 6 doses prepared and discarding used vials as soon as the preparation and checking process is complete.",,,,,,,,,U,,,,,PVT,,,,,,,2,,,Y,,

I reported the following symptoms, which I attribute to the COVID-19 vaccination, to my spine surgeon.  I had my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, March 29th at 5:45 PM.   Lower back pain in the general area of my surgery (07/09/2020) woke me up from sleep around 4:30 AM Tuesday (03/30/2021) morning.  Being woken up from sleep had never happened previously - not before surgery, following surgery, ever.  I recall the pain being a dull throbbing ache, nothing sharp.   I recall being generally pain free Tuesday during the day and went for a mile and half walk Tuesday evening and hit  about 20 40-yard (or less pitch shots) Tuesday evening.   I woke up Wednesday at my usual 6:45 AM.  Although I don't recall being in pain getting out of bed, I do remember being in excruciating pain the remainder of the day.  It hurt to walk (landing either foot) and the only position that I had any relief was sitting at work.  The pain was frequent, sharp, and up to a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I felt exhausted and feel asleep at 7:30 PM Wednesday night.   I was in significantly less pain Thursday, although it was still uncomfortable rising from a seated position and bending at the waist (to assume a putting position in the office) caused pain to the extent that I chose not to fully bend.  Thursday night was generally OK but there was one point, while seated on a couch, where I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the general area of my surgery.  I tried to change positions to alleviate the pain, but it persisted for 30 seconds before finally subsiding.  The pain felt like I was being stabbed and it was a 8 or 9 on a 1 to 10 scale.   Friday was a repeat of Thursday.  Generally, I have very little pain except when I stand from a seated position (1 or 2 on a 10 point scale) or bend slightly at the waist (3 or 4).  The pain is dull but the pain from bending does prevent me from bending comfortably.   All of this pain is new this week since Monday.  This past weekend I worked in the yard, including some heavy lifting and digging.   Is there any chance this is a side effect of the vaccine?  Should I schedule an office visit to evaluate the pain?

I assessed once again for angioedema, anaphylaxis, hives, redness, swelling, but didnt see anything. Since the pt was dizzy I did not offer her benadryl liquid but instead offered clairitin. The pt was merely having a panic attack post immunization and said she could swallow tablets and was feeling better. I gave her one clairitn tablet otc. She wanted to sit up so I assisted her to a sitting position while she was on the floor. She sat there for additional ten minutes then moved into a chair and was brought food by her husband because he said she did not have breakfast and thought that could be why she was dizzy. She was not a diabetic so I was not concerned about her BG. She said that this never happened in the past when I reviewed her PCQF form prior to giving her the vaccine. She has had zero history of syncope so this was rare for her. After an additional 10 minutes she had a bp reading of 98/60 and left the store feeling much better",,,,,,,,,Y,04/05/2021,04/05/2021,0,,PHM,,None,None,None,,,2,04/05/2021,,,,None

The patient came to our pharmacy to receive his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during a COVID vaccine clinic day.  He does not normally fill prescriptions at our pharmacy.  The patient weighed above 260lbs, so I chose to use a Safety Needle that was 1 & 1/2 inches in length.  The safety needle and syringe that was used was manufactured by DPS.  The Safety Needle UPC was 6958697604640, Lot 20201110, Exp 2025-11-09.  The DPS 3ml Bare Hypodermic Syringe that was used was UPC 6971352283639, Lot 2010058, Exp 2025-10-09.  The dose was appropriately pulled up in the syringe as 0.5mls.  When I went to inject the patient the needle did not insert into his skin easily, and when I applied extra pressure my thumb must have been on the plunger and a small amount of vaccine discharged from the end of the syringe prior to entering the patient.  A drop of vaccine rolled down the patient's arm for approximately four inches, and the drop was large enough that I did have to wipe it off of his arm following vaccination.  I estimate that the patient did receive definitely half, if not 3/4 of the vaccine dose, as I did have a fair amount in the syringe to push once the needle did break the skin.  One thing that another colleague and I noticed about the syringes is that the plunger slips in and out very easily.  It could be said that it is even too loose.

Patient reports his symptoms started on Saturday and failed to improve.  He contacted his PCP and he was recommended to go to the ER for evaluation.  Patient had his COVID-19 vaccine-1st dose 2 weeks prior and was concerned that he might be having 1 of the rare side effects from the vaccine. On admission patient had normal vitals.  His labs were within normal limits.  Patient's presentation was discussed with Neurology who recommended admission for stroke workup given his comorbidities-hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity.  Patient received 1 dose of prednisone 80 mg in the emergency department for treatment of Bell's palsy (patient's symptoms more consistent with Bell's palsy presentation).  Patient was admitted to medicine service for workup of stroke with MRI brain without contrast and monitoring for any worsening of neurological symptoms.  Patient's CT head on admission was negative for any acute abnormality.  CTA head and neck showed near occlusion of intracranial left vertebral artery.  MRI brain without contrast was negative for acute infarct.  Patient's facial paralysis slightly improved with 1 dose of 80 mg prednisone.  Patient's presentation was consistent with Bell's palsy.  Patient worked with PT OT and speech therapy and was recommended outpatient physical therapy and speech therapy.  He was discharged home in stable condition on oral prednisone 80 mg daily for 7 days and valacyclovir 1000 mg 3 times a day for 7 days.  Patient was recommended to follow-up with Ophthalmology as outpatient for possible left eye patch if his symptoms fail to improve.  Patient's Lipitor dose was increased to 40 mg daily from 10 mg daily due to finding of atherosclerotic changes on CT head and neck.

They recommended follow up with GYN and a biopsy.  I continued to have significant bleeding and cramps until the next week when I called the nurse line and they set me up with a virtual visit with GYN provider.  She started me on progesterone and scheduled a hysteroscopy and D & C for the following week.  The progesterone slowed the bleeding down but I continued to experience abd cramps.  I had the D & C and after getting home started to have heavy bleeding and bad cramps again.  The following week I called the GYN provider and she had me come in for another Abd US and checked my HGB which was 9.3.  She also checked for infection and other labs which were all within nml range.  The pathology from my D & C was neg and the GYN really was not worried that is was anything other than a period but was surprised that it was lasting so long.  She gave me TXA and after 5 days on that the bleeding has now stopped but I am still having bad cramps in my lower abd and a lot of bloating.  Also having lots of jolting pains in lower abd.

She reported it not being blood and too much to just be some condensation underneath the bandaid. Therefore, she thought it was the vaccine that didnt entirely get into her arm. Unclear how this could have happened, I directed the patient into looking into getting an antibody test in 2 weeks to see if her body produced any post vaccination. She called back two weeks later and said her test came back negative. I called the CDC confused and they reported that antibody tests would not show antibodies produced through vaccination and would only show that produced naturally through previous infection. The CDC then suggested that if there was a device malfunction and that the full dose was not administered, that the dose should be readministered. Patient was adamant that she did not get full dose and after talking to her Dr, it was the pharmacy's decision to revaccinate due to full dose not being administered.

I looked for other symptoms of allergic reaction but couldn't find any. This continued for about 20-30 minutes and then the husband stated she has never been in this state for this long. I reached out to my store manager to ask him to call the paramedics. The patient opened her eyes for a few minutes but then would return to her unresponsive state.

I also don't have  any history of GI problems.  I have been eating a bland diet to try and help with the stomach issues, which have improved somewhat but are still not resolved.

However, the throat swelling is new.  I took a single puff of an Albuterol inhaler around 5 minutes after the injection,  but it had no effect (usually the case for me when the cause is allergic in nature).  About 37 minutes after the injection, medical staff advised me to take an antihistamine.  I took approximately 6 mg of doxylamine succinate (orally).  However, by this point, the breathing had already started to ease slightly.  Approximately 30 minutes later, my breathing was back to normal and the throat inflamation was gone.  It's uncertain how much of that would have occurred through time alone and how much of it was the antihistamine starting to take effect.  My BP was very high when measured during treatment.

Upon arrival to emergency depart patient is well-appearing and nontoxic.  Vital signs reviewed.  Patient is fairly hypertensive.  She describes the symptoms coming on immediately after shot.

She is given 0.1 mg of oral clonidine.  Blood pressure show significant improvement.  Patient is feeling much better at this time.  Certainly may have been a component of blood pressure here so I am unsure if this was related to her COVID-19 shot.  I did discussed follow-up with primary care physician as well as return criteria.
