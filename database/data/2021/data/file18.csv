Within about 10 minutes she began experiencing shortness of breath, throat felt restricted and severe nausea. Myself, another pharmacist, and several members of the staff met them in the parking lot and assessed her condition. Because of her symptoms, we determined it was appropriate to go ahead and administer the EpiPen 0.3mg and call 911 at that time. About 10 minutes later we gave her a 25mg oral dose of Benadryl while we waited on the ambulance to arrive. The ambulance arrived within the next 10 minutes and by then the patient stated she was feeling much better. The EMT examined her and declined any further medical assistance. I called the patient at her home 2 hours later and she said she had some light itching and dizziness. I told her the dizziness could be due to the after-effects of the EpiPen but if it worsened or there were any other signs of an allergic reaction to report to the ER immediately or call 911. This may have been more of an anxiety related reaction due to there being no signs of swelling around the lips or mouth, but we decided it would be best to be overly cautious in this situation.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/09/2021,02/09/2021,0,none,SEN,,"ALEVE ONLY WHEN NEEDED; VITAMIN C, VITAMIN D3, B12 ORAL, ZINC",NONE,MILD ARTHRITIS,,,2,02/09/2021,,,,"ERYTHROMYCIN, SULFONAMIDE ANTIBIOTICS, AND SOME FOODS"

My Obgyn and I suspected that this was herpes and possibly had been dormant for many years.   However, herpes tests came back negative.

Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped.

That same day I called my Asthma doctor and did a video call and was prescribed Breo inhaler, spiriva inhaler, xoponex nebulizer treatment and xoponex rescue inhaler. I couldn't go to work because of my shortness of breath and coughing. The treatment didn't work. On Tuesday 1/26/21, I called my asthma doctor again and another video call was made. She changed my inhaler to symbicort, still continue spirirva inhaler and nebulizer treatment. I also contacted my primary doctor who asked that I schedule an appointment with him so he can see me. On 1/28/21, I saw my primary doctor who did blood works to see if I have any blood clot and to see how my heart was doing. I was given phenergan with codeine to help with my coughing and it did help me to go to sleep. My blood works came out negative and he ordered CAT scan of my chest since I can't get rid of my SOB and coughing. I had the CAT scan on 2/3/21. He called me the next day and I was told that I had mucous plugging. He told me to go home and he prescribed Duoneb nebulizer treatment 4x a day and spiriva inhalers 2x a day.

Numb feeling, tingling in extremities for 2-3 days post vaccination.  Still some occasional numbness and tingling in nose, facial area, and back of head/neck.  Diarrhea for a couple of days.  Continue to experience mild nausea 1.5 weeks later.  Did not have problems with nausea previously.   Moderate fatigue for about a week following vaccination.  Still noticing mild fatigue, getting tired easily and earlier than usual.   Arm was sore from the day after vaccination until about 4-5 days had passed.  Still otice an occasional pain  when moving arm around a certain way.   For 4-5 days following vaccination noticed various body pains.  Pain in lower back- not muscle pain but something else.   Chest wall pain when breathing in from 1-2 days to about a week post vaccination. Headache for a day.  Brain fog feeling, forgetfulness beginning the day after vaccination and was noticeable for about a week.  Still noticing this mildly and feeling more lightheaded than usual.   Over the last few days, I've noticed chest tightness and some mild coughing.  It's also below zero here, so this could be related to weather and dry air, or possibly related to the vaccine.   Generally, I recognize that the above symptoms are possible after this vaccination.  However, the existing literature seems to suggest these symptoms should last 1-3 days and be mild.  My experience has been that they were worse than mild, most lasted at least a week, and some seem to be continuing.   I am also breastfeeding a 19 month old.  He had a brief bout of redness on about half of his body (underarms, forearms, thighs, knees) for about 30 minutes a week after I received the vaccine.  He has never had that before for no apparent reason, and it did not continue, although he has reacted to lotions and certain brands of diaper wipes in this way previously.  We have also noticed that he's been more irritable lately- throwing tantrums easily, sleeping more often, and getting inconsolable.  We haven't tied this to any illness, although we do recognize that toddlers can through periods where they have more challenging behaviors.  This is unusual for him though, he's generally happy and agreeable.  I thought I'd mention it just in case there's been some sort of pattern that other breastfeeding moms have noticed.",,,,,,,,,N,01/29/2021,01/29/2021,0,None at this time.,OTH,,Postnatal Vitamins- New chapter.

She is not questioning if the vaccine was given correctly or not.  She asked if there was anything that states how many people had no side effects. She had the second vaccine Pfizer, last Wednesday. And she had heard that it gives one some fever and may be chills or small things that shows that one are taken it and what worries them was they had no symptoms at all.

He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn't remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn't know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had ""sore arm for a couple of days"" after the 1st injection, but ""nothing more"". However, in the last 4-5 days, he's been feeling ""miserable"". He didn't have fever. But he's been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor's appointment scheduled this Wednesday.

Still rested a lot, had diarrhea, nausea, headache off and on t/o day. --Tues. 2 2 21:  Had a planned day off anyway.  Same symptoms as Monday and same energy level.  Felt positive about going back to work on Wed. --Wed. 2 3 21:  Woke up feeling the best of the past days and went to work.  Still fever of 99 and I noticed I was ?off? all day.  Example:  I forgot my schedule book and Id tags at home (I NEVER do that).  Made weird ?forgetting? mistakes.  By 1pm I was EXHAUSTED and having diarrhea, nausea, chills, and headache.  Called the Employee Exposure Line and my manager.  Went and got COVID test at request of EL and contacted immunologist and primary MD.  Immunologist is on vacation x 2 weeks and covering MD deferred to whatever primary said.  Dr. covered for my primary MD, Dr.  She asked me to touch base with her on Thurs after results from COVID test, but she recommended that  I rest ?and let my body adjust to the vaccine?. --Thurs:  2 4 21:  Up at night from 2:30am on and off with nausea, diarrhea, chills, headache, weakness, shaking, brain fog, sweating.  I am also having some anxiety at this point.  COVID test negative.  I did send a message in MyChart to Dr. as requested.  She called me later in the day and instructed me to drinking fluids and rest.  She ordered blood work which I did go and do.  Also contacted Urgent Care though MyChart and spoke with a CRNP about my symptoms.  She felt that they were a reaction to vaccine and my anxiety. --Friday:  2 5 21:  Called out of work again due to all of above symptoms.  Diarrhea has resolved and no longer any fever, however fatigue, lightheadedness and dizziness,  headache, ?brain fog?, and cognitive symptoms remain.  I am off balance and have difficulty concentrating  and reading.  I did communicate with my neurology office and they stated that it is ?just a reaction to the vaccine?. --Sat:  2 6 21:  Called Employee Exposure line to report same symptoms as above.  Same headache (almost migraine?  Having an aura?)  I am not sure why I feel so foggy.  Did have some ?clearing? of my head in the afternoon. --Sunday:  2 7 21:  Woke up feeling worse immediately.  Horrible headache, lightheadedness, off balance, difficulty focusing and concentrating.  No fever.  Called Employee Exposure Line to report symptoms and they recommended that I call the Urgent Care MD again.  Called urgent Care MD through MyChart again and tried to go into see her at Healthcare, however it was snowing hard and I slipped 3 times so I called the Healthcare and made apt for Monday 2 8 21 for 10:30am. --Monday:  2 8 21:  Headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty with multitasking as of this AM.  Went to Healthcare and saw CRNP.  She wrote for Augmentin for possible sinus infection and I filled at the pharmacy.  She instructed me to see my neurologist regarding possible neuro symptoms from COVID injection reaction.  I communicated with workers from comp team.  I am allowed to see the neurologist from the Dr. office.  I called their office and office manager tried to refer me back to primary.  I insisted that I see the lady as I was referred from CRNP at Worker?s Comp.  They were agreeable to a telemed appointment as soon as I get my claim number.  I am exhausted, have a headache, and difficulty focusing at this point.  Sore throat started this AM and is way worse tonight.  B swollen glands near carotids.  Started Augmentin. --Tues: 2 9 21:  Cont headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty concentrating, difficulty with lights and sounds.  Trouble reading.  Saw neurology this AM at 10am in the office as opposed to telemed visit and had a MRI at 12pm.  She diagnosed a fair amount of things including vaccine reaction possibly causing intractable headache, migraine, dizziness w/o vertigo.  Wants me to start to Propanolol for the headaches.  Need to pick up from the pharmacy.  Out of work until 2 15 21 and then a partial return to work?  Not sure how that works.  Hopefully just feeling better and can go back full time.  I have to contact the neurologist through portal at the end of week to update on progress. Health care called me and wants me to have a visit with a vaccine specialist.  I need to fill out CDC form for vaccine incidents.  Bad headache tonight that started behind R eye and is now whole head.  Need to call ENT tomorrow to discuss MRI results.  Left the neurologist a question on portal about MRI.  --Wed. 2 10 21:  Woke up with light headedness, fatigue, dizziness, off balance, feeling ?off? cognitively.

No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

Within the last hour or so, the pain level has diminished a bit.  NOTE: I know how people rate pain is super subjective.  In my case working as a geologist in a quarry a number of years ago, I was struck and pinned by a large boulder.  The ER crew would not give me a pain killer, so that they could monitor how the Jaw of Life was working (it broke, the boulder was too heavy), so I not surprisingly passed out several times from the pain level before being extricated.  Needless to say, this compound fracture of the tibia and fibula accident was a 10 of 10 pain level.  Yesterday's CV-19 jab pain level was an 8-9 of 10.  Nothing I read before yesterday's jab, Fauci et al, prepared me for this pain level.  So, is this normal???  My POV is, I think, atypical in this matter of pain.

The 101.5F fever lasted for about 9 days.  I also experienced shortness of breath from 01/14 until the 22nd and I never had to use my rescue inhaler before. I had to use it and had to even call for a second one. I am very athletic and active and never need it even after my runs and workout activities. I consulted with my PCP on the 19th and again she gave me a covid test. Negative. She diagnosed me with inner ear infection (right ear). Prescribed me Levaquin and in 2 days I was much better. On the 22nd I finally started seeing the symptoms subside and started feeling better.  Also, I wanted to tell that I had a gas pain episode that almost sent me to the ER. My chest, my left shoulder hurt really really bad. I called a friend who is a physician and he told me to take some gasex first and if that did not work to go to the ER. Fortunately it worked.

I took another Benadryl at 5pm that day and 20mg of zertec the evening of the 5th along with my normal medications. Other than a headache and a very sore arm, everything seemed fine.I was happy to get vaccinated.  The morning of the 6th I had planned on taking a Benadryl and zertec again, but got sidetracked and forgot. I had taken my normal morning thyroid pills, and drank my morning coffee, nothing else out of the normal. Nothing to eat, everything was fine until 11:30am (26 hours after vaccination shot) I noticed my throat & tongue starting to shooting pain and then starting to swell. I immediately took a Benadryl & zertec, took my albuterol inhaler and grabbed my epic pen. 15 mins later my pulse was at 139bpm (according to my iWatch) and I felt like I was going to pass out. I auto injected with epic pen, but didn?t know to hold it for 3-10 secs, so I didn?t receive a full dose of the medication. My heart rate started going up again and I was having to focus on my breathing and called 911. An ambulance came and I had to give myself another Epi Pen injection as I couldn?t breathe. The ambulance crew (two people -were not EMT?s and just a volunteer crew), so I had to inject myself, as they watched and I pulled the epi Pen away again, which I learned from them was incorrect to do. Just the little amount of medication I got from the Epi Pen semi calmed things down for around 20 mins, then 10 mins away from ER  - my HR went up to 149bpm (I was informed by ambulance attendant and verified with the heart monitor on iWatch later), I was fighting unconsciousness (was told by attendant my BP dropped out and I lost all my color) and could not breathe. I went limp and couldn?t hold my head up, the attendant helped to support my arm as I auto injected myself with the last Epi Pen, and held it for a 10sec count.   [ER report has misinformation. All of my Epi Pens were expired and I knew this, but its all I had. I also injected myself with all of them unlike the ER report says. For some reason the ER doctor was not fully listening to what had happened (from the ambulance crew and from me) and made mistakes in the ER Report. I have been advised to contact the hospital and address the ER Doc actions and report issues for my visit.]  As we pulled up to ER, the epi pen had calmed most everything down, my heart rate was just slightly elevated and my breathing was still difficult and I had to focus on that. I was administered Steroids and Pepcid AC, intravenously at the ER and was monitored. Then was released an hour or two later when all my functions where at a normal readings.   Everyday since I have continued a course of Benadryl, Zertec, Pepcid AC, albuterol, 200mg Celebrex, and 11mg ER Xeljanz. I have still been experiencing throat tightness and extra phlegm and have also started to take a daily 20mg steroid course to help with remanding allergic symptoms, I have been having as directed by my allergist. I?m hoping the vaccine clears my system soon as it still seems to be affecting my system and my body is very ?hyper vigilant? it seems.

1021521,02/10/2021,CA,28.0,28,,F,,"Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) on January 31st, 2021. About 2 hours later, I had moderate-extreme pain in my left arm (couldn't raise my arm). About 4-6 hours later, I had side effects such as a red, raised rash near the shot (about, 3-4 inches in diameter), fever (99 degrees), swollen painful lymph nodes under arm pit (left arm) and fatigue. On February 1st, 2021, I continued to have pain in my arm, rash and swollen lymph nodes for about 48 hours. After that, my rash was then no longer visible. No medication was taken for symptoms.  On February 7th, I noticed in the morning that my rash near the shot came back (same location) with no other signs or symptoms. The rash was now red and flat (not raised).  On February 8th, around the 4:00PM my head felt heavy (sort of like a head cold), fatigue, loss of appetite, stuffy nose, fever (100-101 degrees). I took an Advil that night at about 10:00PM (first time taking medication to treat symptoms).  On February 9th, in the morning my symptoms (fever, fatigue, stuffy nose) were gone. My rash mostly went away in the morning (still slightly visible). My appetite in the morning seemed to return but I felt slightly nauseous after eating breakfast. Around noon, my nausea dissipated, I felt fatigued and had a fever of 101.6. I took Motrin at about 5:00PM and my fever dissipated. That night, at about 10:00PM I went to bed and was unable to sleep at all that night (extremely unusual as I don?t have any problems sleeping). I felt my fever came back at about 11:00PM but tried to go without the Motrin until about 3:00AM. I checked my temperature at 3:00AM which was 101.9 degrees. Due to feeling extremely uncomfortable I took the Motrin at that time. My fever dissipated again and I was able to get maybe a couple hours of sleep.   On February 10th, I woke up with no appetite, joint pain in my elbow of my left arm (no history of injury) and a fever of about 100 degrees at 11:00AM. I had a very small breakfast at about 11:00AM. I haven?t felt hungry since 4:00PM today, consistent with a loss of appetite. Currently, I?m checking my temperature about every hour or so and have been going back and forth between 100-101 degrees. My elbow joint pain on my left arm has only started today and it has only flared up in the morning and then the afternoon. I took another Motrin today at 6:00PM and will take another tablet of Motrin before bed to get rest.

She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated.

The vaccination facility type was reported as the clinic. The patient had no medical history. She had no family medical history relevant to the adverse event (AE). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines that day. She did get a flu shot maybe a month prior reporting or longer and again mentioned she had no problems with vaccines in the past. She did remember getting a pneumonia shot and another one that she did not remember the name of. She got flu shots every year. The patient had no history of previous immunization with a Pfizer vaccine. The patient explained she experienced vomiting 12 hours after the injection of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. She asked if her symptom was a reported side effect for the vaccine. She also asked how to avoid this experience after the second dose of the vaccine. It was further reported that on 23Jan2021 at about 23:00, when she went to bed, she felt like going to the bathroom. She sat down and started to throw up, she was vomiting, and it came so fast without warning. She made a mess and had to take another shower. This was 12 hours after getting the vaccine and the first time she had ever had this happen. She got a flu vaccine every year, since her husband was a nurse and told her to get vaccinated, but she had never had this to happen with any other vaccine in past. This was her first reaction to anything. The patient was asking if this happens to other people. She had been fine since that had happened, but she didn't have any warning and didn't feel nauseous. She had the sheet and it said you could experience nausea, but she didn't. She even checked with her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson who she ate dinner with and no one else was sick and so they think it's the vaccine and didn't come from something they ate. She had to go back in 3 weeks and was given the sheets/paperwork. The patient also reported that she did wait there at least 15 minutes after getting it to make sure no bad reactions occurred immediately afterwards and she didn't and she figured she wouldn't.

The events were considered medically significant. Details were as follows: The symptoms were quite intense and interfered with her life, requiring gabapentin prescription for control of neuropathic complaints.

Patient saw physician who performed workup for common associated etiologies of polyneuropathy, which were negative.

The burning was experienced more in the left foot than the right foot. Reports it was severe enough for the patient to reach out to her primary care provider.

The patient went into to the office, and she had a skin biopsy to rule out small fiber neuropathy. She does not have results to provide for the skin biopsy at this time, however, the neurologist feels if the skin biopsy is positive, there may be an association with the vaccine in regards to the burning pain the patient is experiencing. She is calling to ask if this is a reported side effect. Treatment was confirmed as gabapentin was prescribed by PCP, and the patient started on it a few days after the onset of the burning pain.

The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. She got the initial injection 06Jan2021 (at the age of 53 years old), in her upper left arm.

It didn't necessarily have a shape. She had a large bruise on her right buttock. Two days later, she noticed a similar in size bruise on the front of her right thigh. Then a a couple days later, she noticed three quarter size bruises on her right arm (2 on the inner part of arm, and 1 on the outer, both on upper arm). The very next day, she developed the same sizing bruise. It was about the same size on her left upper arm. Just the one. There were no other side effects besides the bruising. There was no itching or redness, no skin, respiratory, or neurological issues. She received the 2nd vaccine yesterday, 27Jan2021. She didn't have a prescribing doctor. She got it based on contact with COVID positive patients. The day before the vaccine, 26Jan2021, she noticed a 4 inch reddened area with a two centimeter nodule inside that bruise. Today (28Jan2021), the day after the vaccine, she now has, on her left side, in between her shoulder and neck area a nodule that was about 2cm in diameter. It was hard and painful. There was a little redness around it, but it hasn't went into bruising yet. This is how the other ones started. There was a little redness and a bruise appeared. All of the bruises didn't have nodules. The nodule is present now. The initial bruises have begun to heal. They were not as dark as they were. The one that was noticed the day before yesterday is beginning to darken. They started out red and then turn black and blue. The one she noticed today 28Jan2021 is just the nodule. No discoloring has occurred yet. She can't answer seriousness yet because she doesn't know how serious it is yet. She also had numbness and tingling in her right thumb and was having some chest discomfort after the initial injection that is still ongoing. That chest discomfort prompted her to go to urgent care on 08Jan2021. She had an abnormal EKG 08Jan2021. They told her to follow up with a cardiologist so she did. She saw the cardiologist on Monday 25Jan2021. He did an EKG and ECHO. The EKG was abnormal, but the doctor was unable to determine when the heart attack occurred. He also ran labs. He did a Troponin to see if anything was acutely going on, and a D Dimer to evaluate her clotting factors. Both were negative. He recommended a CT scan.
