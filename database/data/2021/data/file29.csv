I'm also allergic to the metal used in the replacement. The scar reacts by getting red, hot, puffy, and itchy whenever my allergies are bothering me.

All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient's wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.

Woke up to a less painful arm and it improved throughout day feeling almost normal by bedtime 24 hours later.  Took 2 Tylenol to ensure sleep.  Woke up Tuesday morning and arm felt almost 2100% normal.  I thought, wow, that wasn't so bad.  BUT I WAS WRONG.  Tuesday mid morning, I began to feel what I would describe as jittery.  Around 11:00 am a wave of nausea washed over me and subsided.  I thought maybe I needed to eat as I hadn't yet so I had lunch.  After lunch I began to feel nauseous again and like diarrhea was coming.  After going to the bathroom, the nausea started building again,  and the diarrhea recurred, and the nausea heightened.  By mid afternoon I was on the floor hugging the toilet bowl wanting to vomit, waiting to vomit, groaning.  It's been years since I've had nausea or vomiting and the whole experience was unexpected from what I read about possible reactions.  I wondered if it was food poisoning but my husband and I had eaten the same thing and he was fine.  Finally about 3:30-4:00, 48 ours post vaccine, I threw up multiple times, perhaps 5 times.    After about 4:30 pm it was over.  I was worried that if I ate again I'd be sick so I only drank decaf tea.  I felt exhausted from the ordeal but very wired and jittery too.  I crawled into bed hoping for sleep.  No luck.  At 3:00 am I was still watching the clock and shocked that I couldn't sleep.  I had to get up at 6:30 in the morning due to some construction at our home.  I was legit exhausted Wednesday.  I no recurrence of the nausea or diarrhea after the bout on Tuesday afternoon.

On Monday morning I noticed my whole arm was achy in addition to the top of my shoulder and the left side of my neck and  upper shoulder blade.  At 9:30 am I felt very tired and laid down and awoke 4 hours later!  My aches were still all there as though I had slept wrong.  Again I was not too concerned except that my friends all said their discomfort was gone within 24 hrs.  Today is Tuesday and evening and as I sit here I have a very tender, sore, achy upper left arm and a small black and blue spot at the site.  It's strange because it doesn't hurt when I touch it, instead it is just an ache/pain that I feel and especially when I move the arm.  The tightness and ache in my neck and back and shoulder has lessened.  I am reporting as I was not expecting this type of reaction especially to last  3-1/2 days so far.

1087215,03/10/2021,NV,69.0,68,,M,,"Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75� (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3� hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this ""illness"" before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with ""stomach flu"" where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6� hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister's friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four ""victims"" had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures� I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel �normal.'  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2� days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  ""Pain"" from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first � unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey�.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the ""adverse reaction"" field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.

Reported her mother has had no more nose bleeds since yesterday 22Feb2021.  She said her mother is still quite weak, but her blood pressure is now under control. She said her mother has been on a stroke watch while at the hospital, and her mother has not been allowed to get up out of bed as of last night (21Feb2021). She said the hospital staff are supposed to let her mother walk today (23Feb2021) to see if her mother's blood pressure stays stabilized. She said her mother's comprehension is not at the same level as prior to being hospitalized. She clarified her mother still drives a car at 92 years old and takes care of her own check book. She said she doesn't know if her mother will still be able to do that at this time. Reported her mother was checked for a UTI while at the hospital. She said the hospital went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI without knowing if her mother had a UTI. She said because her mother is elderly, a lot of times the elderly have UTIs. She said the hospital didn't want to waste time and went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI because her mother hadn't been on antibiotics recently. The caller stated she did not have any information on the medications her mother has been given while at the hospital. Reported at first she did not think her mother's symptoms had to do with her mother's first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, but then there was a new part to her mother's story that made her think her mother's symptoms had to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller stated she is apprehensive for her mother to go get her second COVID-19 Vaccine shot.

The hives came back a few days later and one of the doctors I work with told me to start taking an H2 blocker on top of the H1 blocker I was already taking. It worked well.

She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA >1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 > 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.",,,,,Y,3,,,Y,01/02/2021,01/04/2021,2,,PVT,,levothyroxine 88mcg QD,hypothyroidism,hypothyroidism,,,2,03/10/2021,,,,none

I take this drug only when needed and thought it would help the aching in my legs. Maybe it did...maybe it was a coincidence that the achiness was alleviated enough for me to go to sleep.

Part 1: I had my second Moderna vaccine on 2/16. 36 hours later I was laying In bed when I all of a sudden felt very strange- sort of faint - like I was going to pass out. Then I started feeling like my Body was going numb. We called 911. I was taken to the ER. What followed was about 15-20 ?neurological? episodes (every ten minutes or so) where my entire body from head to toe became paralyzed- I couldn?t move any of my limbs. I also had no sight. I was not blacked out Bc I could hear everything that was happening. It was also accompanied by extreme chest pain, numbness, contratcing of muscles in chest cavity that felt almost like a heart attack. Each individual episode lasted about 3-5 minutes and then slowly the paralysis would undo and I?d regain feeling. And then the full episodes would start over a few minutes later. This went on for a few hours repeatedly while in the ER.  I was admitted for testing  and monitoring for two days (EEG, EKG, MRI, Catscan) all clear. Once discharged I had lingering neurological symptoms but not the full paralysis episodes. Lingering symptoms included severe chest pain, numbness/weaknesses predominant on the left side as well as other random areas. I was very weak and tired. I started to improve very slowly - by day 10 post hospitalization I was starting to feel like things were turning the corner and maybe I was on my way to recovery. Part 2: I started to finally feel more improved from the lingering neurological issues and then all of a sudden around 5:30PM I was in the kitchen making dinner for my kids on 3/2 and the episodes started again. Called 911. Again, every ten minutes or so they came on (maybe 15-18 episodes) of complete paralysis- this time accompanied by seizure like rapid eye movement from side to side and fluttering of the eyes. I was readmitted to the hospital where the episodes repeated to happen again, maybe 15-20 times. I was admitted. They did a 24 hour video EEG which ?caught? the episodes on video and sound but did not appear negatively on the EEG in terms of abnormal brain activity. I?ve been released as they say there is nothing to do. I have lingering muscle weakness in my eyes- I can?t focus my eyeballs or ?track? on an eye exam and continued muscular chest pain.

In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the ""thrombosis"" had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.

Janssen had no recommendations for partial dosing, split dosing and we were instructed to follow up as we felt most appropriate.   We ultimately administered the additional 0.4 mL partial dose to the patient.    In reviewing incident with involved Pharmacy staff, it appears that unintentionally a 1 mL syringe was given to this vaccinator amongst the standard 3 mL syringes used to administer the 0.5 mL dose.  It was reported to me that the vaccinator self reported that when she was drawing up the intended dose of 0.5 mL she did not recognize that she was using a 1 mL syringe.  Vaccinator drew the dose back to the first major marking on the syringe (0.1mL).  On the 3 mL syringes the first major marking is 0.5 mL.    The Pharmacy staff reported that the 1 mL syringe packaging and the 3 mL syringe packaging are nearly identical.  After this incident Pharmacy staff segregated all 1 mL syringes to ensure 1 mL syringes were no longer supplied to any vaccinator.

Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barr� or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient's lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.

Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for V-Safe and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on V-Safe under other'' multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud's Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the pimple had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was seen in an outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic and diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia. I was placed on a leave of absence from work as of 2/26/2021. 3/1/2021, I was seen in-person appointment with my primary care provider hoping to provide a work note, further assessment of shingles that have spread over neck and back of neck.

The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)",,,,,,,,,Y,02/26/2021,03/01/2021,3,,PVT,,"Insulin, workout supplements and vitamins.",Diabetes,Diabetes,,,2,03/10/2021,,,,None

I went grocery shopping and when I got in the store, I started feeling sick like when you get the feeling you are going to vomit; feeling nauseous and it seemed like it was intensifying as I shopped. I was trying hard not to throw up.  I started feeling like I wanted to shake but I wasn't shaking. I got to my mom's house and I ran and vomited. I still felt tired and my mom told me I looked sick and I laid down on her couch. I felt sick for two or three or four days - felt really sick for awhile. Then anxiety set in and I thought I might have COVID and I raced to my doctor and she wasn't there and I went to Health Department and I called the CDC and the CDC assured me it was fine and it was a side affect and reassured me and relieved my anxiety.

He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.

When I woke up and opened my eyes I noticed a bilateral arborizing, interlacing dark pattern that lasted less than a second. This was opaque but without a ghost image and otherwise the wall, sheet,  and ceiling were seen clearly behind that network.   I experimented with opening and shutting either and both eyes looking at a white sheet beneath me, and found that especially with my dominant left eye I saw a pattern resembling my left eye retinal vascular tree.  The branches originated as single vessels  superiorly and inferiorly that branched down to smaller vessels  all on the right side of a disc type structure without duplication into an identifiable arteriolar and  venous system. Even with a light source moving over my left shoulder,  the image never lasted longer than a fraction of a second and fatigued quickly with repetition.  I laid back down and repeated the experiment of opening and shutting either eye while looking at a white ceiling. Then the image changed to a horizontally oriented pattern with two single black vessel type structures coming off a disc type structure.  The dark lines further branched and narrowed as they extended to the right and left off the disc type structure.  Again this lasted less than a second. It faded away rather than floated away. The image always appeared in the same area of my field of vision. It was peri-central when I looked at the wall and inferior to fixation when I looked at the ceiling.   The image would immediately move with eye movement, unlike a vitreous floater. Opening and shutting my left eye could refresh the image very briefly but that fatigued with repetition and could not be reproduced after 3-4 trials or without several hours between attempts. I did  translations of Purkinje?s description of the Tree (described here later.)  and had short term  partial success with his methods, except for pushing on  my eye, and using galvanic current,  which I did not attempt.  I declined a full exam but did  remember a lecture about Purkinje images.  He had the residents hold pen lights to the side of their eyes and move the light back and forth while he  described the Purkinje Tree. Afterwards he quizzed the residents about whether they could see it or not, with the ?humorous? disclaimer that it was a means of IQ testing if they could see it.  Half could.  It was of interest to me that  before I retired,  occasionally patients would mentions seeing the tree after an ophthalmoscopic exam.  I hoped to delight those patients by  telling them it was a form of IQ quiz and they had done well.  Two weeks later I was disappointed that I could no longer see the tree, but again declined an exam.  I am optically conversant, but physically adverse in seeking self care.   Purkinje first described the ?Tree?2) in his doctorate thesis in 1819. It was included in descriptions of other entoptic phenomena, performed mostly on himself. This was before the ophthalmoscope was discovered and before quality histological, serial sections were available.  He described holding a candle or using galvanic illumination in front of his eyes individually and moving it around.  He could see  black lines in a network that came off a central pit structure.  There were two lines inferiorly and superiorly with adjacent shadows and ultimately had size reducing branches.  He recognized these branching lines as retinal blood vessels, but could not discern any blood flow.  In 1825 he published a further volume 3) that dealt with experiments he subsequently had performed.  He found that by holding a sheet of paper with a hole in it that he moved around,  he could get a better view of the blood vessel pattern.  He could discern the macula and described anastomosing blood vessels superior to inferior.  A significant improvement in his discerning the blood vessel pattern was obtained with a safe amount of pressure on the superior lateral aspect of the eye.  With this he could recognized blood corpuscles and flow patterns and then labeled the lines as veins. He did not describe arteriole patterns.  So this leaves us with the question why this sudden awareness of the Purkinje Tree appeared in the time frame of a second Covid-19 vaccine.  This will require further reports to determine coincidence versus cause-effect.  This is a high stress time with Covid-19 deaths so prevalent. I had immediate relief after my second shot with a reduction of tension and increase in awareness of my general physical status as in the feeling of being hot or cold, sleepy or just fatigued, improved calmness, and the pertinent Purkinje Tree.  At sign in for the second series of Pfizer injections the RN on duty asked about side effects from the first shot.  She asked us to send a report in of any potential side effect then of the second shot and notified us that people were having more problems with the second shot than the first. Arm soreness, swelling, fever, chills, headache,  malaise, fatigue.  She gave us a print out list of known side effects, mostly systemic and all mild, but nothing ophthalmic.  With these things  in mind I was especially vigilant of any thing new in my general health or condition.  Most of the patients getting the shots were students and the congregating area was in a wing of a hospital.  This brought back the pleasant memory of my time in training and  my chief?s description of Purkinje?s Tree and perhaps enhanced the  brief ability to see the entoptic image.  In between times playing with this image my vision was normal and  my general health remained good, without symptoms of vascular compromise.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/22/2021,01/22/2021,0,none: Clinical diagnosis only,OTH,,none,none,none,,,2,03/10/2021,,,,none

Patient was greeted by staff, and she alerted Site Director, of the incident to check if the patient had received the Pfizer vaccine. It was discovered that the patient had scheduled a 2nd Dose of Moderna shot, was approved to enter the vaccine location upon arrival earlier this morning (greeter unknown), and was administered the vaccine by CMA and contracted employee. The patient clearly stated on his form that he had received the Istdose of Moderna on 2/10/21 but when asked by the processor at the vaccine station, if he was here for a 1st dose Pfizer vaccine he replied ""yes"" and never presented his vaccination card showing his 1st dose of Moderna so he received a new vaccination card with Pfizer 1st dose with today's date. When questioned by Site Director why the patient responded yes he would like the Pfizer, patient, stated he wasn't paying attention.Site Director also questioned both the processor and immunizer why neither of them noticed that the patient answered ""yes"" to receiving another vaccine and indicated it was ""Moderna.' Both indicated that they simply weren't ""paying attention because he answered yes to wanting the first dose of pfizer."" Site Director consulted with CDC representative, and was advised to update the patient's card and educate the patient to enact V-Safe which is a portal that allows CDC to track patients after receiving vaccines. CDC also stated the following on their website cdc.gov: ""Every effort should be made to determine which vaccine product was received as the first dose to ensure completion of the vaccine series with the same product. In exceptional situations in which the vaccine product given for the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available,any available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series. In situations where the same mRNA vaccine product is temporarily unavailable, it is preferable to delay the 2nddose (up to 6 weeks) to receive the same product than to receive a mixed series using a different product. If two doses of different mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products are administered in these situations (or inadvertently), no additional doses of either product are recommended at this time.""",,,,,,,,,U,03/09/2021,03/09/2021,0,NoNe,OTH,,unknown,unknown,unknown,,,2,03/09/2021,,,,NONE

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20's, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer's vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn't have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours.

On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn't do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient's blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient's highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient's blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient's kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn't have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender's Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Patient stated that she would wake up in the night and need three or four treatments. Patient stated that before being sick, she had horses and it would take 15-20 minutes to do her routine with the horses, but while she was sick, it took two hours. Patient stated that she would walk out and back, and it was an ordeal, she was tired and short of breath. Patient stated that the doctors called it severe respiratory inflammation, and that was in Nov and Dec2020.

I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL.

I went to my primary care providers for my annual physical and to address my concerns with the vaccination. I gave blood work. Later into my afternoon, I notice that I began to itch across my sternum and I thought it was an allergic reaction to some of my common allergies. I took some Benadryl to calm the itching to get rest. I was out of work from Wednesday February 17, 2021, @ 1300 to Friday February 19, 2021, without pay, returning on Monday February 22, 2021.   On Monday February 22, 2021, I came into work and felt fatigue, light headed, headache, blurred vision, and some great deal of body pain. Approximately 2145, I notice that I was having trouble breathing and began itching profusely. I grabbed my epi pen and gave myself an injection. I laid back on the bed and I fell asleep. The following day Tuesday February 23, 2021, I barely had energy to get up and get ready for work. I prevailed because there is nothing set in place for people who experience an delayed allergic reaction to these vaccinations. I have literally been pushing myself through my workdays because I can not afford to be off.   On Sunday February 28, 2021, I notice that the rash began to spread across my body parts. My arms, neck, shoulder, upper back, behind my ears, legs, and again I figured it related to my allergies. The condition continued to get worst throughout the next week. It was several occasions I almost lost control of my vehicle because the itching sensation had hit me instantly while driving. Once I was able to pull over, I just began to scratch every area of my body. Therefore, Friday March 5, 2021, I drove myself to Hospital too seek help.   I explained my situation, I was checked in, and I showed how the rash had spread all over my body. It was nothing they could do but give me IV fluid, did some blood work and Prednisone 10mg (5 tablets) and send me home without relief. I continue to suffer from this vaccination and no one has any answers to give me. My scar-less skin now looks unattractive and dark spots where there was a rash that came and went but left awareness that I once had a rash in that spot.   I am scheduled to see my dermatologist today, Thursday, March 11, 2021. My appointment time is 1615. I went my employer to file a notice of the outbreak and to see what if anything that they could do. It was just a standard report and they are submitting all information to the CDC.   I am a health care professional and my job requires me to stand, sit, bend, lift, push, pull and assist in all aspects of an operating room that has caused me some issues and concerns that I can not perform my duties as required due to the severely of the itching.",,,,,,,,,N,02/17/2021,02/17/2021,0,02/17-2021 Blood Work Primary Care Physician 03/05/2021 Blood Work Hospital Emergency Room 03/11/2021 Dermatologist,PVT,,BENDARYL 25MG CYCLOBENZAPRINE 10MG MELOXICAM 15MG ALPARZOLAM 10MG ZOPLIDEM 12.5MG GABAPENTIN 800MG,LEFT SHOULDER LABRUM TEAR ROTATOR CUFF TEAR SUBACROMIAL DECOMPRESSION IMPINGEMENT CERVICAL COLUMNBAR SPRAIN LEFT WRIST CARPAL SPRAIN LEFT HIP LABRUM TEAR LEFT KNEE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT,CHRONIC SEVERE MIGRAINES,,,2,03/11/2021,,Y,Y,LATEX PEANUTS DOG CAT APPLE ORANGE GRAPE TOMATO JUICES COFFEE TEA MALT GRAPE NUTS

After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.

Concurrent medical conditions included breast cancer.   On an unknown date, the patient received Shingrix. On an unknown date, 9 days after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced guillain barre syndrome (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), lower extremities weakness of (serious criteria hospitalization), fall (serious criteria hospitalization), dysphagia (serious criteria hospitalization), areflexia (serious criteria hospitalization), loss of sensation (serious criteria hospitalization) and hypophonia (serious criteria hospitalization).

The reporter considered the guillain barre syndrome, lower extremities weakness of, fall, dysphagia, areflexia, loss of sensation and hypophonia to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), in a female patient aged 66-year-old, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.     The patient was an old physically active woman with a history of breast cancer in remission. No information on patient family history or concurrent conditions or concomitant medication was reported.   On an unknown date, the patient received Shingrix (administration route or site not reported; dosage unknown, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported but it could be between 65 years or 66 years at the time of vaccination.  On an unknown date, 9 days after vaccination, the patient experienced sudden onset of leg weakness. On an unknown date, the patient presented with a sudden onset of leg weakness, which spread proximally over two days resulting in 3 falls and a mild associated dysphagia. She denied recent travel or sick contacts.  The patient neurological exam revealed decreased strength in lower extremities (4/5 hip flexion, 4/5 knee extensors/flexors), decreased sensation in the calves and diffuse areflexia of the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankles. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) and a viral hepatitis panel were non-reactive. glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), creatine kinase (CK), B12, CK, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were all within normal limits. A contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the complete spine and MRI brain were without acute pathology. Analysis of her cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) revealed cytoalbuminologic dissociation concerning for GBS: protein-53.2 mg/dL, WBCs 1. Therapy with IVIG was initiated but on the second day, the patient's weakness progressed to the upper extremities, her dysphagia worsened and hypophonia developed. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. With completion of 5 days of IVIG, the NIF normalized, dysphagia resolved, mild improvement was seen in hip flexion strength bilaterally and her upper extremity strength remained stable. The patient was ultimately discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility.  The case was considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The authors commented ""In 2004, causality was confirmed between the 1976 influenza vaccine and GBS. The association between GBS and other vaccines remains anecdotal due to a paucity of available data. The adjuvant recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was first marketed in October 2017 for the prevention of herpes zoster in individuals aged more than or equal to50 years. A pooled analysis of two large randomized trials in 2019 did not show an increased risk of developing a new potential immunemediated disease (pIMD) or exacerbation of an underlying pIMD in RZV recipients aged more than equal to 50. Our patient's GBS onset developed 9 days after vaccine administration. To our knowledge, there is only one other reported case of Zoster vaccination associated GBS in the literature."".  The authors concluded ""Although there is no established connection between RZV and GBS, our case should alert clinicians to recognize this serious adverse effect and promptly advise their patients for hospitalization. As more post vaccination GBS cases are recognized and reported worldwide, providers will be more primed to discuss this potential side effect with their patients prior to vaccination"".

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Recurrent Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), in a male patient of unspecified age, who was vaccinated with Unspecified Influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.   No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received Unspecified Influenza vaccine (administration site or route unspecified, dose not reported, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported.  On an unknown date in 2015, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with GBS. The patient required 18 days of mechanical ventilation for GBS following influenza vaccination. At that time, the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PLEX) and made full recovery. The patient was eventually discharged to a long term acute care hospital.  On an unspecified date in 2020, the patient received Unspecified Influenza vaccine (administration site or route unspecified, dose not reported, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported but it could be between 63 years or 64 years at the time of vaccination. On an unknown date, unknown period after vaccination, the patient developed paresthesias of the right hemibody and weakness that progressed to inability to feed himself and ultimately respiratory failure 48 hours later. Approximately five weeks after receiving Influenza vaccine, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) of the neuraxis showed the prior right MCA stroke (Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence showed the encephalomalacia from the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct). Initial evaluation in the neurosciences intensive care unit found him to be alert. The patient's negative inspiratory pressure (NIF) was -5cm H2O (normal more than 60 cm H2O) and right upper and lower extremity power 0/5 with 0/4 reflexes. The patient was on apixaban for atrial fibrillation; thus, initial lumbar puncture was deferred while waiting for clearance of the medication. Given patient history and examination, PLEX was started. The patient received 5 sessions over a period of 8 days. Lumbar puncture was performed and showed normal cell counts with elevated protein (108 mg/dl (normal 15-45 mg/dl)). Nerve conduction study (NCS) showed prolonged motor distal latencies and severely slowed conduction velocities with reduced compound motor action potential (CMAP). Sural sensory response was normal. F waves were absent. Electromyography (EMG) showed fibrillation potentials (+1) in the right deltoid along with severely decreased recruitment in the right triceps and right tibialis anterior. These diagnostic tests were consistent with GBS and the patient was diagnosed with recurrent GBS. At the age of 64 years, the patient with history remote right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and left hemiplegia was transferred from an outside hospital for ascending weakness of the right hemibody, areflexia, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient continued to improve clinically. By day seven, right upper extremity strength had improved to 3+/5 and lower extremity at least 3-/5 in proximal muscle groups. Patellar muscle stretch reflex improved to 1+/4 but Achilles reflex remained 0/4. The patient was successfully extubated and eventually transferred to a long term acute care hospital for anticipated long-term rehabilitation and treatment. The case was considered as serious due to hospitalization. The authors commented ""We report a case of recurrent GBS. In both incidences, separated by approximately five years, the influenza vaccine was given within 6 weeks prior to symptom onset. There may be an increased risk for developing GBS from pandemic influenza vaccinations (such as H1N1) compared to seasonal vaccination. Notably, the patient described in our case did not meet all of the characteristics. He was older and had a classic GBS presentation. His presentation, however, was milder than his initial GBS. There likely is a genetic or immunologic host susceptibility that plays a role in recurrent GBS. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices currently notes a precaution for revaccination in patients with a history of GBS after an influenza vaccine. The committee also states that influenza vaccination may outweigh the possible risk for certain patients who have a history of GBS within six weeks of influenza vaccine if they are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Although recurrence risk is documented to be low, clear risk factors for recurrent GBS have not been consistently defined in the literature. Further studies are needed to determine which patients are at the highest risk for recurrent GBS"".  The authors concluded ""The risk of GBS following vaccination is low at one to three cases per million patients vaccinated. Additionally, the incidence of GBS recurrence after vaccines appears low but has not been well described. However, despite the low incidence, it is important to carefully weigh risks and benefits of revaccination.""",,,,,Y,,Y,,N,,,,"Test Date: 2020; Test Name: Electromyography; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:See text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2020; Test Name: Lumbar puncture; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal cells,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2020; Test Name: Magnetic resonance Imaging; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:See text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2020; Test Name: Nerve conduction study; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:See text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 2020; Test Name: blood protein; Test Result:  108 mg/dl; Comments: Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) of the neuraxis showed the prior right MCA stroke (Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence showed the encephalomalacia from the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct).

Concurrent medical conditions included hypertension and thalassemia (minor).   On an unknown date, the patient received Herpes Zoster vaccine. On an unknown date, 1 day after receiving Herpes Zoster vaccine, the patient experienced rhabdomyolysis (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), influenza-like symptoms (serious criteria hospitalization), emotional distress (serious criteria hospitalization), myalgia (serious criteria hospitalization), palpitation (serious criteria hospitalization) and urine discoloration (serious criteria hospitalization). On an unknown date, the outcome of the rhabdomyolysis, influenza-like symptoms, emotional distress, myalgia, palpitation and urine discoloration were unknown.   The reporter considered the rhabdomyolysis, influenza-like symptoms, emotional distress, myalgia, palpitation and urine discoloration to be probably related to Herpes Zoster vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Rhabdomyolysis, in a female patient aged 60-year-old, who was vaccinated with unspecified Recombinant Zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient had past medical history of hypertension and thalassemia minor. No information on patient family history or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received unspecified recombinant zoster vaccination in her left deltoid (administration route unspecified, dosage unknown, batch number not provided), did not have any immediate adverse effects vaccine. The age at vaccination was not reported but it could be between 59 years or 60 years at the time of vaccination.  On an unknown date, next day after vaccination, the patient called reporting flu-like symptoms. Six days after administration, the patient presented in distress, complaining of severe myalgias in the shoulders and legs, palpitations, and dark colored urine. The patient denied dysuria, frequency, urgency, and was afebrile. Urinalysis revealed 3 plus (+) blood and 2+ protein. Laboratory studies showed a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level more than 23,000 (iU)/L with significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1265 U/L and 747 U/L, respectively. Thyroid stimulating hormone, Lyme disease titers, antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor, viral panel, blood cultures, and further immunologic workup were unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the hospital for severe rhabdomyolysis. The patient denied any previous history of rhabdomyolysis, recent trauma, immobilization, statin use, toxic exposure, and new medications. The patient's symptoms, CPK, and AST/ALT improved over the next several days with aggressive hydration and the patient was discharged in stable condition. At one month follow up, the patient reported complete resolution of myalgias and denied any recurrence of symptoms. The second dose of the recombinant vaccine was not administered. The Naranjo Score was six, characterizing rhabdomyolysis for this patient was a probable adverse reaction. The case was considered as serious due to hospitalization. The authors commented ""In this patient, there was no evidence of the common precipitating factors of rhabdomyolysis. While it may be difficult to definitively establish a direct relationship between a specific exposure and an adverse outcome, methods exist to determine its likelihood. Depending upon the cumulative score of 10 questions, a possible adverse reaction is classified as definite, probable, possible, or doubtful. For this patient, positive findings include the following: the adverse event appeared after the drug was given, the adverse event improved after the drug was discontinued, alternative causes were ruled out, and objective evidence of the adverse event was available. These results yield a Naranjo Score of six, characterizing rhabdomyolysis in this case as a probable adverse reaction. Although the exact mechanism of this reaction is not known, we believe an exaggerated immune response to be most likely. The association between rhabdomyolysis and the vaccination is largely based upon the patient's history and exclusion of other common precipitating factors such as trauma or immobilization. Considering the possible lethal complications of rhabdomyolysis and the widespread use of the recombinant zoster vaccine, this potential serious outcome must be acknowledged and symptoms not ignored. Perhaps, patients with a recent history of risk factors such as trauma should delay in being vaccinated. At the least, patients reporting significant myalgias after administration should be tested for rhabdomyolysis"".",,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,"Test Name: alanine aminotransferase; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:747,Unit:u/L,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: antinuclear antibody; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: aspartate aminotransferase; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1265,Unit:u/L,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: creatinine phosphokinase; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:23,000,Unit:IU/L,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: blood cultures; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Thyroid stimulating hormone; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: immunology test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: rheumatoid factor; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Urinalysis; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:See text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: viral panel; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:unremarkable,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Comments: On an unspecified day Lab test were performed.
