Medical history included macular degeneration (the wet kind), blood pressure high, spinal stenosis, and thyroid disorder (reported as thyroid something) she provided that it was something like hypotramea (as reported). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at the age of 88-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid on 29Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and mentioned that she had a reaction but didn't think it was from the vaccine because it was 5 weeks to the date after the second shot. The reaction was very severe, and she had to visit the emergency room. The patient experienced throat closing, tongue swelling, face swelling and a hard time breathing. She saw her primary care provider after that, and she also saw her PMR doctor- physical medicine and rehabilitation. The doctors recommended that she report this reaction to the COVID 19 vaccine five weeks later. Both doctors thought it might be from the vaccine and it was worth reporting. When asked about the symptoms and if they occurred at that same time, the patient stated yes, and they diagnosed her symptoms as angioedema in the emergency room. This happened on 26Mar2021. The patient was never admitted to the hospital. When asked if angioedema improved, worsened or was persisting, patient stated it was nonexistent now. The events happened after the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had to stop her medications because her primary care provider was unsure what may have caused this reaction, but it may be her medications. She has been taking losartan potassium for about ten years but now had to stop because angioedema could possibly be the result of that, even after ten years. She also had to stop diclofenac sodium because they may have caused that kind of reaction. Having to stop ibuprofen broke her heart as she has taken it for years. This too could have that type of reaction. For aflibercept, she mentioned that she gets the injections in both eyes every eight weeks. She had it 31 times in the right eye and 30 times in the left eye. The reaction she was speaking of, the emergency room, came exactly 2 weeks after she had her last injections, which was on 11Mar2021. Angioedema was an emergency situation, if the throat closes and they couldn't open it up, they may cut into the neck and windpipe. The description was enough to scare her. Both doctors suggested the Pfizer vaccine as just possibly a late reaction. The patient had a basic metabolic panel while in the emergency room. She reported that potassium and sodium was low. Chest Xray- the patient did not have a report on it. Nasal scan was fine. COVID nasal test was negative. Swab for many other kinds of viruses was negative. All of these tests were done on 26Mar2021. The action taken in response to the events for losartan potassium, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, and aflibercept was unknown.

The event, deathly sick, was life-threatening. The clinical course was as follows: the patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Mar2021 at 14:00 in the afternoon in her left arm. Twelve hours after the first dose, later in the night about 02:00 AM she woke up deathly sick; and severely nauseous.

There must have been something in there; she knew there must be something in the vaccine because of her reaction. Adds a few years ago, something like this happened before. She had osteoporosis and had similar reactions with other products she had tried for osteoporosis; she had terrible nausea. The other products she tried included: in 2008 she took alendronate, it made her very sick but not as severe as this time, she never fainted. She had nausea and diarrhea. Then in Dec2017 she had zoledronic acid. She went for an infusion at the hospital then went shopping, and was fine until the early morning, when she woke up with nausea and vomiting. In the ambulance, they gave her ondasetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea so the vomiting stopped. With regard to her ankle, first they thought it was a DVT blood clot. They did the xray and saw actually two fractures on her ankle but she does not need surgery. She saw the orthopedic doctor the other day and he said her ankle was healing but she still will have no weight bearing for 6 weeks and she was in a boot.

The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. He received the Covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. The following day he later noticed his elbow started bothering him that night, and around midnight it woke him up. He had intense pain in the elbow and tried to tough it out. 4 hours later he was in the ER, it was that bad. When he got there they did an ultrasound and some X-rays. The ultrasound showed his elbow was swollen, and they removed 17cc of fluid. They asked if he had any trauma to his arm and he said absolutely no way. He doesn't know what to think. He was trying to find someone to help with the issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain was a strong 10. To this day it was still bothering him pretty bad. He coundn't work because of it. He could hardly straighten it out because it is so sore. It was painful, but not as bad as Saturday(10Apr2021) and Sunday(11Apr2021) morning. On 13Apr2021, his hand swelled up. That's gone away. His thumb hurt on 14Apr2021 and that had gone away, he just aced that. He put ice on his elbow. His elbow from last night(13Apr2021) to today (14Apr2021) probably had a 30 percent change. It is getting better but it is still sore. He can't straighten it and he is trying to bend it to work it so it doesn't get stiff. With the work he does he needs to use his arms. He works in construction. He got the shot on 09Apr2021, and the pain was later in the day. He received his dose around 0945, and at about 1500 to 1530 he noticed his elbow bothering him. Later that night when he went to bed he was uncomfortable and couldn't sleep. Eventually he did fall asleep and at 0000 he woke up in excruciating pain. He tried to deal with it until 0400 when he went to the ER. His pain is nowhere near what it was. When he tries to straighten it, it is very painful, about a 6. If he bends it back it is much better. If he tries to straighten it the pain level goes up. It is still swelled up a bit. It is hard to say if it has improved, he never really saw it. He went to bed and when he woke up he was in so much pain. He had on his PJs and put on his shoes and left. All he knew was he was in pain. He presumed it was more swollen then, they did the ultrasound and found all that fluid. The pain in his thumb subsided a bit. He took the ice off of it about 30 minutes before this phone call, so about 45 minutes ago. It feels a little better. At least one part of the puzzle is solved.

Family Medical History: both parents had diabetes; mother has Protein S deficiency as well that causes blood clots. The vaccine was administered at healthcare facility. The patient did receive previous immunization with a Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination.  The patient received her first shot on Monday 12Apr2021 and was fine until 12 hours later. Her arm swelled up and she couldn't lift it. Then the swelling went to the back, the shoulder blade up the left side of her neck. She could feel her lymph nodes and so she was icing it, taking Tylenol and the swelling has gone down. The redness was gone but she still has arthritic type pain in left arm socket. She can lift and move the left arm, but it hurts, and it also hurts when she turns her head to the right. She received the Pfizer COVID vaccine in her left arm. The pain started at injection site and then went from her elbow to shoulder and then up her shoulder and up to the neck. Her family was commenting on her neck being swollen. She received her shot at 4:30 PM on 12Apr2021. The redness and swelling started at around 5:00 AM on 13Apr2021. A couple hours after Pfizer COVID vaccine injection the pain started. She waited for 30 minutes because she takes coumadin for a history of blood clots, nurse wanted to wait to make sure her arm wouldn't bleed. She has been taking Benadryl ointment and icing it for 3 days as treatment for the events. She got up at two this morning to go to the bathroom and noticed she could still feel the pain when she turns her head to the right. She had swollen submandibular lymph nodes and could feel two of them before. When she woke up, she could not feel her lymph nodes. Everything has recovered except for the pain. The patient stated that on the first day the symptoms were disabling, and she couldn't lift her left arm at all. They got better once she started icing it and rested instead of doing chores.

There was a deep ache right now in the socket that goes up her neck and down the shoulder blade to her back. Right now, she doesn't like to be in any pain and would say the pain was mild compared to how it was, the pain was so bad she was rocking and crying. Her brother gave her one of her mother's pain pills, one Vicodin because she was in so much pain. She can control the pain now with the extra strength Tylenol. She got the Pfizer COVID vaccine for lots of reasons. She has a lot of health problems, she had COVID virus last April and that was why she was having this reaction since she already has antibodies. She takes care of her mother who was sicker than she was. She was out in the real world and she doesn't want to bring anything home or get anything herself. She thought gabapentin would have made it to where she did not have the arthritic pain from vaccine. She takes gabapentin for neuropathy. She was diabetic and that may have something to do with it too. Patient stated that everyone else in her family got Johnson and Johnson and nobody had reactions. She was supposed to get at the Johnson and Johnson shot first but with the shortage it was switched over the to Pfizer COVID vaccine. This was her first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

Patient wants to know the efficacy of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after a single dose and also wants to know if a booster for the other COVID-19 variants (i.e a third dose) will be needed in 6 months. Responded as there is limited data of the efficacy of the vaccine after a single dose, efficacy data started to get collected 7 days after the second dose with a 95% efficacy rate. The need for a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine based on duration of protection or impact of variant strains has not yet been determined. Patient wants to know what is the longest time that she could wait to receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Responded as a second dose 6 weeks or 42 days after the first dose is still considered valid. The recommendation is to take the second dose as close as possible to the 3week time period.

He had gone into atrial fibrillation. His doctor prescribed Eliquis and put him on a heart monitor. He took a nuclear stress test and that was ok and now he's wearing a heart monitor. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metoprolol (METOPROLOL) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation from Feb2021 and ongoing.

No additional Administered Vaccines on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 17Mar2021, he experienced a little bit of soreness, no complaints, no issues. He was scheduled for the 2nd shot on 09Apr2021 or somewhere. However, on 04Apr2021, he started having a runny nose, coughing up phlegm. He has a history of COPD treated by CPAP. He lost his sense of smell and taste. On 7 or 8Apr2021, he took a covid test. He did not get 2nd shot. Covid test results were negative: IgM and IgG (antibodies not detected) and stated that it does not preclude acute sars-cov 2 infection. The D-dimer part of the blood work came back as 0.44 (reference says it should be less than 0.5). A t the end of Feb 2021, he had A-Fib treated by Eliquis. The doctor said it should be 0 if on Eliquis, but attributes that result to him taking the Pfizer vaccine and explaine dit as a higher blood clot risk. His 2nd shot is scheduled for tomorrow. He was told by the doctor to wait until mid May and start all over again with the [Redacted]. Caller would like to know whether increased blood risk has been reported as related to the covid vaccine. Referenced EUA Fact sheet for HCPs under section 6 OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY, Unsolicited Adverse Events: There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient wanted to know it is normal to test negative for antibodies after his initial dose. Caller requesting assistance interpreting his blood work results. Provided basic information and referred caller to his HCP for interpretation of his results. The patient had his first Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021. He had no issues with the first vaccine. About 2 weeks after he received his first Covid 19 vaccine maybe around 01Apr2021 he started sneezing, having some phlegm, and coughing stuff up. He does use a CPAP machine at night. Around 09Apr2021 he lost his taste and he lost his smell. He was scheduled for his second Covid 19 vaccine on 10Apr2021 but thought his symptoms were worse than he originally thought. He went to his doctor on 09Apr2021. His doctor did the nasal swab for the Covid 19 virus. He never had a fever or chills. His doctor gave him some erythromycin. He also did some blood tests. His Covid 19 virus test came back negative. On the results of his blood tests on the first page, the first thing it says are that his Covid 19 results are negative. His doctor told him that his body showed no response to the Covid 19 vaccine. He doesn't see that this blood test is testing for antibodies. Later in his blood test paperwork he sees that it says ""antibodies not detected, does not preclude acute Sars-Cov-2 infection"". His paperwork says IgG and IgM were negative. He provides the following in a historical context. In Feb2021, prior to receiving his first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine he had some heart problems. He had gone into atrial fibrillation. His doctor prescribed Eliquis and put him on a heart monitor. He took a nuclear stress test and that was ok and now he's wearing a heart monitor. He's reading from his blood test results. His D-dimer result was 0.44. In the reference range it says anything less than 0.50 is a normal range. But he is taking Eliquis and his doctor told him his D-dimer should be zero. His doctor told him his D dimer was elevated. His doctor believes the first Covid 19 vaccine has something to do with his D-dimer result. The caller reports that he has heard about the [Redacted] and [Redacted] vaccine and blood clots but he hasn't heard anything about Pfizer having problems with blood clots or anything of that nature. His doctor told him that his body showed no response to the Covid 19 vaccine.  Later in his blood test paperwork he sees that it says ""antibodies not detected, does not preclude acute Sars-Cov-2 infection"". His paperwork says IgG and IgM were negative.

I was moaning and crying and didn't know what to do. After they came to check on me about 15 minutes later, I asked if I could take Advil and they said I could so I did. I also told them I felt like I was going to throw up, so they gave me this bin, and I threw up twice.  I was supposed to get my period later that day or the next day, but it hadn't started yet and I felt completely fine when I first got there before I got the shot. But it was almost instantaneous after the shot that I had the sweating, nausea, and period cramps that made me feel like I couldn't walk or talk because I was in so much pain. I kept wanting to be crouched down and also to have my head down. The nurse kept asking me what I needed, and I didn't know, I just kept saying, ""I don't feel good, I don't feel good."" I eventually asked to go to the bathroom because I thought that might help even though I didn't actually have to go. They took me to the bathroom where I kept moaning and crying and felt so awful. Only a couple times did the pain subside for about 5 seconds but then came right back. I think it was probably an hour of this when they called the paramedics to take me to the emergency room. But as soon as they arrived to the women's bathroom in the mall where we were, the pain finally subsided. They still wanted to take me to the ER, but I convinced them not to because I was feeling better and worried about the bill I would receive and dealing with all the insurance stuff. They eventually agreed to let me stay in my car 30 more minutes while being monitored. The nurses were all very nice and gave me juice and snacks to help the nausea, and then they scheduled my next appointment at the hospital and told me I should come with someone next time. When I got home I noticed my arm was sore, but I knew that was normal so wasn't too worried about it. However it's now been sore almost three weeks, and I can't move it certain directions, which is super frustrating because I've been pursuing dance outside of my day job and hadn't gotten an injury from that all year, but now all of a sudden I can't move my arm a lot of ways and it's affected me being able to take class and do choreography, and also regular household things. I can't reach with my left arm to grab things, and I can't ever tense the muscle in my upper left arm / shoulder, and if it tenses by accident (i.e. I go to grab something that's falling or see a bug), pain shoots through.

Shortly thereafter, I felt very nauseous and cold clammy. I had a sip of water, than sat down next the toilet since I thought I had food poisoning and needed to throw up. Instead, I passed out and fell from a sitting position against the wall. I woke up a few seconds later, to find my right ear cut and with quite a bit of blood (not sure what I cut it on, maybe my own thumb nail?). I stood up and walked to the sink, so I could bleed over it while apply pressure so I wouldn't make a mess. My wife had woken up at this point, and shortly after I got to the sink, I passed out again while standing (fortunately she caught me) and started twitching for a few seconds before coming to (I came to while still standing up). At this point, my wife drove me to the emergency room and we were admitted. In the ER from 4:15am-7am, they did a CT scan on my head without contracts, blood work, and an EKG. All three tests came back normal and I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. I have no history of any prior vasovagal event. At the ER they also sewed my ear up with 6 dissolvable stitches, gave me a big of IV fluids, a tetanus shot, and then sent me on my way, discharging me at 7:00am on 4/16. I then saw my primary care doctor that afternoon at 1:00pm on 4/16 who reviewed by medical records/test results from the ER, concurred with their vasovagal syncope diagnosis, checked my stitches, and said I could go back to normal activity largely unrestricted.

The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can't remember basic words.

She had the ?back patch testing done? and had received allergy shots on a regular basis from a very young age for many years. The allergy testing resulted in her being allergic to weeds, grass, trees, all plants, bees, insects and more.  No medication allergies nor ingredient of medications allergies was noted, nor did pt note that she had ever had any issue with any IMZ in the past.

He went out to speak with the pt and had her sit on the floor and asked her to lye completely down on the floor.  The pt felt uncomfortable with this direction from the pharmacist and said she did not want to lye down, ---- as the floor was very dirty.  The pharmacist did not offer to get her a blanket, pillow nor did he ask any of the pharmacy associates to do so.  He also did not call the store management to assist with this ---- nor let them know she was having issues with the IMZ.  The patient said, ?she DID hold her hands up to her throat, and said she thought she was allergic to the vaccination? to the pharmacist---and he just returned to the pharmacy.  She ?thought? he was calling 911 or getting an epi-pen in case it needed to be administered. Pt stated that  returned to check on her after 15minutes, and then told her to set another 15 minutes and that her color looked better.  He seemed to think it was anxiety or a panic attack.  The patient stated that ?it was Not a panic attack? ?nor anxiety? at all.  She has taken Ativan since the age of 14 for other reasons, but she was not nervous about receiving the IMZ that day.        When the patient returned on 04/27/21, she informed the lead tech what had transpired on 04/06/21, and thought that it should be documented.  On 04/27/21, she was slightly apprehensive about receiving the IMZ, as she was worried it would happen again.  She was positive that she needed to complete the series and get the 2nd dose in spite of the concern.  I contacted the market director at the time and discussed the about events with her.  She said, ?it was OK to give it to her?, and to have the Epi-pen close by and have her under supervision at all times after the administration.       I gave her the 2nd IMZ on 04/27/21 at 9:31am and stayed by her side the entire time.  I had the epi-pen ?in ?hand"" and the patient did say that her throat was scratchy and she became somewhat nervous, but as I continued to reassure her that I was there , and do matter what ?she would be OK?  and we would do whatever was necessary to be sure of that.  The patient had taken the Ativan on both 04/06/21 and 04/27/21 -- and it was not a panic attack nor anxiety as the pharmacist concluded or assumed on 04/06/21   The patient was upset on 04/27/21 that he had her sit on a dirty floor, did not come back to check on her except for 1 time -- and that was only to tell her to stay on the floor another 15 minutes.  She said, ?I don?t think he knows the protocol ?for a patient with an anaphylactic reaction??   She was very grateful  --- after waiting until she felt comfortable and steady to get up and go.  Before I administered the IMZ, I asked her, ?If she had anyone with her that was driving??  so, I?d know she was not alone in the store afterwards.       The patient did fine, and there was ?no need to administer? the Epi-Pen.  She was still concerned, ?that pharmacist did not know the proper protocol to follow for anaphylactic reactions??  She said, if he had been there on 04/27/2021, she was not going to have it done at that time.

At around 1:40 am, patient was able to move enough to get out of bed to find a second blanket and extra strength Tylenol and took the Tylenol with some seltzer water and hid under blankets to get warmer. After about an hour, around 2:30 - 2:40 am, the shaking was reduced enough that the patient was able to relax and try to get to sleep. At 5;30 am, the patient woke up with much the same symptoms, but with the addition of the worst headache he had had since he stopped having migraines in his mid 20s and also his whole body ached like he had been hit by a truck (that [getting hit by a truck] had happened to him once about 15 years ago, so he has the actual reference to compare against).  This experience was worst overall body aches/pains ever experienced by the patient. He took additional Tylenol at 6 am and about 30 minutes later, the chills subsided and the pain was reduced enough that he could go to sleep again. Shortly before 10 am the symptoms started to get worse again and he took ibuprofen (400 mg) at 10 am, after the shakes started to come back. He has traded off every 4 hours taking tylenol and ibuprofen, which keeps the temperature perception swings to a minimum and overall body aches lower, but the headache does not go away. He feels exhausted, and has slept for spurts of 15 - 30 minutes on and off all day.  He was able to each crackers at around noon and some homemade chicken vegetable soup at about 1 pm as the nausea had subsided. Prior to that, he could only drink water and Gatorade. He is hoping that within 24 - 48 h he will feel much better, without having to take Tylenol or Ibuprofen.",,,,,,,,,N,05/01/2021,05/01/2021,0,none,WRK,,None,None,None,,,2,05/02/2021,,,,Sulfonamide drugs walnuts

Patient was refused entry to building after informing triage nurse of asthma symptoms, and was turned away due to fear of being contagious of covid-19. Was not physically screened, and was instead seen via tele-health, but no physical measurements / examinations were made. Patient was prescribed albuterol refill, and promethazine-dextromethorphan cough syrup. Albuterol inhaler helped to mitigate wheezing symptoms, but coughing / difficulty breathing still persisted. Promethazine was completely ineffective in mitigating any symptoms. ... Symptoms continued to worsen, and patient sought Emergency Department care on 01 May 2021. One hour prior to visiting hospital, patient was coughing severely and had extreme difficulty breathing. As the cough attacks would happen in waves, when the cough attack subsided enough, patient drove self to hospital while in able-body to drive before onset of next attack. At time of check-in at the Emergency Department, patient was unable to talk as talking triggered coughing attacks. Patient communicated with staff by written notes on smartphone. After check-in and triage, blood work was ordered as well as a chest x-ray. Both labs came back clear. Respiratory therapist administered albuterol/ipratropium (3mL, X1ED STA) nebulizer on 02 May @ 00:51, and patient was also administered Dexamethasone Sodium / Phasphate (could also be under the name Duonebs and IM Decadron) (10mg, X1ED STA) in right arm on 02 May @ 00:52, after nebulizer was complete. Breathing from these treatments had improved significantly, and patient was able to talk in complete sentences. Some coughing persisted, wheezing had mitigated, but was a significant improvement from intake when patient could not talk at all. Doctor reviewed labs and concluded that both chest x-ray and blood lab work showed no signs of other respiratory issues, and ruled out bronchitis/pneumonia, and was confident that patient's chief complaints were consistent with severe asthma exacerbation. According to lab reports: ""Labs showed mild leukocytosis likely 2/2 stress demargination. CXR did not show PNA or other acute process. His presentation is most consistent w/ asthma exacerbation."" Patient was discharged at around 02 May @ 02:00, and was sent with prescription for Tessalon pearles.

She waited the 15 minutes and left, and did tell the pharmacy lady her symptoms.  Her arm was red, and had a headache, but didn't think anything of it.  After 2 weeks she had a red arm, hot, shiny and swollen.  She went back to the store, and had the pharmacy lady look at it who told her she had an allergic reaction, take some Benadryl and go to her doctor.  She took that and went to her doctor as the symptoms did not go away.   She sent her to an allergy specialist.  She did blood work and went to the specialist and still taking the Benadryl.  It was kind of going away, but the rash was warm and he did allergy testing and told her that she had allergies to trees, grasses, etc.   During the time of waiting for the test results of the allergy testing she continued to have the headaches and her mouth started getting dizzy.  She thought maybe it was just allergies.  She was at work cutting hair and almost cut a child as she felt dizzy and fatigued and it gradually came on her.  She had to sit down for a while and that feeling did not go away.  Her boss told her to finish and she was about to cut a child and went to her car, and laid in the car all day as she could not drive home.  She was feeling that it was just some allergies.  Called her husband and went to a store within walking distance, and she was holding onto the basket and feeling dizzy and fatigued and was facetiming her husband and then she felt lost, did not know why she was in the store.  She didn't remember where the car was, and walked around for an hour not knowing what to do or why she was there.  She then sat down to try and get her senses and took something for her headache.  She got to the car and zoned out and tried to drive home and was not able to due to the dizziness and fatigue, but could not remember to drive and telling herself to push the gas and was only going about 5 miles an hour.  She called her husband and told him that she could not drive home, and stayed in the parking lot a little bit longer.  It took her 3 hours to get home, which was normally at 20 minute commute.   She went back to her PCP and told her what happened and told her that she did not feel safe, confused, watery mouth and headache.   She then ordered an MRI to see what was going on.  She then tried to get home again and had another episode and was not able to make it home.  She went to the ER and they ran a lot of tests, CT scan, x-rays and told her that all tests were normal.  He then looked at her and did a neurologic test and told her hat he could not send her home and told her that she did not look fine.  She told him that she did not feel safe, and was not able to function.  She gave him a description of how she felt, and told him that she has short term memory problems, and that if she is driving she does not realize that she is.  She was then admitted to the hospital and did 2 more  CT scans, an MRI, blood work and ended up having a neurologist see her, and told her that all her tests were negative.  It was even hard for her to walk and she had to see a therapist for that, and they put her on some medicine for the dizziness and fatigue.  She was in the hospital for 3 days.    She went back to the doctor on Monday and still having the symptoms, but the medicine did help some.  The doctor saw that she could not walk and fell over.  She called the neurologist again and did another blood tests to see if she had COVID prior to the vaccine and doubled up on the medicine for the dizziness which did help with that but the other symptoms were still there, but she was able to walk but not drive.   She had her go to another neurologist to do an MRI of the brain with contrast of the ear part, and she is to go to the doctor today for those results.  From 2/26/21 until now 5/3/21 she has been taking the medicine to function and be able to walk.  She tried to wean herself off the medicine but she is not able to walk and the fatigue comes back.  She still is not able to drive as the short term memory hits her and she forgets where she is and not able to keep up with the speed of the freeway and driving only 10 miles an hour.     She then called the doctor again as she was still having the episodes, she has not been able to work and was told that she probably had to see a neuropsychologist.   She also was filing out paperwork at one point and got a headache and was not able to fill out the paperwork correctly, and did not remember her 16 year olds information.  She is not able to return to work as the company she was working sold the company and she is not able to cut 2 haircuts a day without breathing hard and used to be able to cut 30 a day.  Her body hurts so bad that it feels like if you touch her skin it?s like she had a full work up.  Her doctor told her that she did not have COVID but her body is reacting as if she did.  She is also used to taking care of special needs and autism kids cutting their hair and is upset that she cannot provide for her family and used to work 7 days a week, 7 hours a day.   She is supposed to go to the neurologist today for the results of her MRI (while talking to me she could not remember why she was supposed to go to that doctor).   She was also having an episode and not able to speak to me, starting babbling.  I told her to take a deep breath and she did collect herself.  They are still trying to determine what is going on and why she is having these side effects which she did not have prior to the vaccine.

By the time I reached the kitchen, I felt woozy, like I had stood up too soon.  Stopped for a moment till I felt steady and then continued to walk to the cabinet, I also was going to take a xanax to help me sleep (prior to this I had not taken a xanex for probably 4-6 weeks).  I put the xanax in my mouth, grabbed the bottle of ibuprofen and felt like I should lay back down asap.  Took a few steps and passed out and hit my head on small round table shelf.  When I came to, I realized I had not even swallowed the xanex yet, it was still in my mouth. I'm guessing I wasn't out long but my husband didn't hear me fall so that is unclear.

Throughout the day and into the next, the swelling expanded across the entire width of my bicep, approaching the size of a softball. Sensations ranged from itching to burning (the area was hot to the touch) and pain. The paperwork I received with my vaccine indicated symptoms should resolve within seven days of vaccination and to report any prolonged or worsening symptoms. I don't have a PCP/GP, however, so I didn't have a physician to contact. I considered going to an immediate care clinic for evaluation but was afraid of potential COVID exposure and decided to wait a couple more days to see if things improved. I'm now 11 days after my vaccine and 3 days after symptoms began and can report that the swelling does seem to be flattening out, though it is certainly still there (as is the rash). Since it is certainly better today than it was yesterday, I am hopeful things will continue to improve. All the same, I thought it was worth reporting since it began 8 days after my vaccination.

The ER nurses were good, but going to the 6th floor was another issue.     Her Dr. on Saturday ordered a swallow test as they could not determine why she had no voice and could not swallow.  It was done and she was still having difficulty getting food down, but it was slow and did go down.  Since he has been back at ALF she is now better, able to walk, talk and go about her life.   While in the hospital she was having a hard time getting her medications, and was given a breathing treatment in the ER, and was still having problems on the floor and was having problems with them getting her medications so that she could breath.  She finally got their attention and told her that she was not okay with her and the lack of the nursing staff care.   She fought to get her Flonase, and by the time she was ready to leave on Saturday she had been given one treatment of Symbicort.    She did have blood tests done to the point that it was excessive, but she had veins that were blowing and there was no access points.  On Friday she refused them as she had been stuck 11 times.  On Saturday morning they came to get more blood and she refused on Saturday evening when she was being discharged, and she was prescribed a multivitamin to take, which she has never taken one before.    She has no heart issues and no chest pains but was discharged home with nitroglycerin.

As the vaccinator screened the client, some medical concerns came up so the vaccinator went over to the lead nurse for a consult. Nurse received a brief report from the vaccinator, and then walked over to the vaccination station to talk to the client. The client explained to Nurse that he received his first dose on his left arm and about 2 days later, he developed ""numbness and tingling"" in that same arm and it has not resolved. As Nurse asked further questions, she discovered that the client also started to develop that same sensation, of numbness and tingling, in his right hand. The client described that it is painful, if poked in those areas. Nurse also asked if this feeling radiates anywhere else and the client explained that, if he sits for a prolonged period of time, the numbness and tingling will develop in both of his lower extremities and he needs to get up and walk around. Client reported that it is not painful in a way that he can rate it on a pain scale of zero to ten, but he did describe it as being ""abnormal for him"" and ""not comfortable."" Client denied any known drug allergies as well as denied any past medical history. He stated he had his left index finger amputated ""years ago, but that is it."" Nurse explained to the client that there are some concerns regarding the new onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine and that she would like to get a medical consult before deciding how to proceed with the second dose. Client agreed. Nurse sent a text message for a medical consult received an answer about 45 minutes later. The medical team recommended waiting to give the second dose until the client is assessed by either a primary care provider or neurologist. They also gave the client the option of receiving the JOHNSON and JOHNSON vaccine 28 days after the first dose, if the client does not wish to receive PFIZER again. Nurse then educated the client on the recommendations. The client expressed to Nurse that he is ""very healthy and does not go anywhere,"" so he does not wish to be seen by a medical provider right now. The client asked questions regarding vaccine efficacy in the first and second doses and Nurse addressed them. The client told Nurse that at this time, he would like to hold off on getting a medical assessment and did not wish to reschedule for a JOHNSON and JOHNSON vaccine.

I went to bed early and slept little because of my high fever alternating with icy chills. I didn't have any Tylenol on hand. By morning, I decided to take ibuprofen. Fever and chills subsided. Although I was very tired, I was able to maintain my usual daily routine. Close to noon I decided that I felt well enough to go to mass. I sat in the back in case I had to leave early. By the time I walked to the last pew, I was exhausted. I decided just to sit through mass. Once it started, I realized that I was too worn out to make the responses, so I prayed silently in my heart. Shortly I began to feel lightheaded; then felt nauseated. Decided I needed to get home. Left the church and and walked and then stumbled down the corridor toward the door. Quickly I felt I couldn't get enough air through my mask; removed the string from one ear. Legs gave out. Slid to floor to get blood to my brain and give legs a rest. DIdn't seem to help. At last decided to walk to car although I felt I couldn't walk. Managed to get up, got through door to outside, laid on ground for a few minutes to rest. Trying to get to my nearby car, got back to my feet (though unable to actually stand), went about 2-3 feet, collapsed on ground again, unable to move.

1283043,05/03/2021,CA,34.0,34,,F,,"On April 12, shortly after I got my second Pfizer shot, I started my period. It was very early by several weeks, and only a week since my previous period ended, which is why I made note of it and have kept a record.  For the first week it was fairly light and mostly spotting. After a week, it progressed and became more like a normal period in terms of the amount of blood I was seeing. By April 23rd I started noticing a lot more blood clots in my period than usual--ordinarily I'll see one or two each time I get my period, but there were about five days in a row when I noticed multiple blood clots. The clots stopped around April 28th, but as of today (May 3rd) my period is still ongoing, making it exactly three weeks long, and more unless it suddenly stops today.  For the most part the blood has been red and I haven't noticed any other unusual discharge. I have noticed the past few days that the blood is more brown, like old blood.  I have not experienced bad cramps or stomach upset during this very long period--I had the same level of menstrual cramping/stomach upset that I am accustomed to over the first couple of days, but nothing since then. I have felt bloated and tired the entire time, however. I have also experienced a really low mood for these few weeks, though I can't be certain if this is worse than I usually experience on my period, because it may just be because it's lasting so long that it feels worse.",,,,,,,,,N,04/12/2021,04/12/2021,0,None as yet.,OTH,,None,None,"Fibromyalgia (very mild case, only occasional pain/exhaustion flare ups)",,,2,05/03/2021,,,,None

My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I'd have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.

After her first dose of the vaccine she immediately noticed flushing of her face and later that day noticed that she had a rash on her face.  She did not report this reaction prior to the second dose of vaccine, but she did tell her vaccinator afterwards and so she was escorted to the treatment area for observation immediately after.  Within a few minutes she was complaining of trouble breathing due to a sense of constriction and congestion in her throat, no wheezing, no itching.  She began to notice that her voice sounded different in that it was more raspy.  She visibly appeared to be working hard at breathing, although it was difficult to discern to what degree this symptom was due to her obesity.  Her O2 sat was 98-100% throughout and her BP and pulse were stable, if slightly hypertensive.  Her lung exam was CTAB. Due to the progression of her symptoms to voice changes, she was immediately administered an EPI-pen.  Within a moment or two, she noted relief in her throat constriction and her voice returned to normal.  She was observed to have decreased work of breathing and appeared much more comfortable.  She was then given 50 mg of benadryl orally.   She noted a racing heartbeat with the EPI-pen but no chest pain.   She agreed to be monitored for a return of symptoms for an extended period of time and she was informed that she would need someone to drive her home today and stay with her.

He verified he was not having any swelling of his face, lips tongue, throat, no difficultly breathing. We also called for store management to come to pharmacy. He and wife stated that he is on an antibiotic for diverticulitis which causes him to do this frequently/daily where he burps up air and dry heaves, but because he hadn't eaten today he was not actually throwing up. Also because of his history of gastric bypass he usually is unable to throw up because there's nothing in his stomach. She states he was doing this same exact thing all morning (yet stated he was feeling fine before administering the vaccine). Patient and wife did not think that it was related to the vaccine at all. He stopped burping and dry heaving and by 1:18p he wanted to leave the pharmacy.

I was diagnosed with  Scedlsporium and Fungal Pneumonia. I also have severe Lymphedema. I had a lot of swelling all over my doctor. I have also been taking Insulin since the vaccine. I had had Rheumatoid Arthritis but it was well controlled with Advil. The Rheumatoid Arthritis is flared since the vaccine and I have been seeing a specialist for that. Twelve weeks out from the vaccine and it is very difficult to work and I still have all of the problems and they are getting worse.

I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of ""waiting to see what happens"" if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.

She disclosed that her boyfriend was a marine and was vaccinated against smallpox two weeks prior to her developing the skin lesion. The specific smallpox vaccine that he received is unknown and her boyfriend did not cover the vaccine site as instructed. The patient's skin lesion was non-itchy, approximately 5 millimeter (mm) blister like rash that ulcerated with a grayish, white center and had a surrounding red border. She denied any fever, chills, pets at home, insect bites or trauma to the area. While at the health clinic, the patient's skin lesion was unroofed, and a sample was sent to Laboratory of Public Health for identification. The sample returned positive for Orthopoxvirus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was instructed to cover the area while at work, keep the lesion open to air at home, and to avoid skin-to-skin contact. The clinic also reported the event to Department of Health for possible contact transmission of smallpox. The outcomes of the events of possible contact transmission of smallpox and lesion on her right upper extremity was not reported.  The patient's medical history includes asthma. Concomitant medications include unspecified nebulizers for asthma.  Author's Comment: Recipients of smallpox vaccine have a potential for autoinoculation and inoculation of close contacts. Hence, the vaccine recipients should be well educated about proper care of the vaccination site for preventing possible contact transmission of the virus. These include covering the vaccination site, proper hand washing after bandage changes, and avoiding skin-to-skin contact.  Company Comment: The suspected drug as described, was possible ACAM2000. ACAM2000 is a live vaccinia virus that can be transmitted to persons who have close contact with the vaccinee. In this case, the female presented a lesion that was confirmed to be Orthopoxvirus.

1284622,05/04/2021,DE,,,,F,,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of inflammatory arthritis in a 10-day-old female patient who received Hepatitis B vaccine. The patient's past medical history included pre-eclampsia (Family History), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Family History), bipolar depression (Family History) (patient's mother experienced during pregnancy and treated with sertraline) and premature baby (born at 36 weeks for maternal preeclampsia).

The reporter considered the inflammatory arthritis, knee swelling, knee effusion, joint range of motion decreased, mobility decreased and joint stiffness to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine. Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Inflammatory Arthritis, in a 10-day-old female patient, who was vaccinated with Unspecified Hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unknown).   The patient was a previously healthy female presented to her pediatrician with a decreased movement of the right lower extremity. The patient was born at 36 weeks for maternal preeclampsia. The mother reported that she had regular prenatal care. The only perinatal complication was preeclampsia for which she was induced at 36-week gestation. Maternal history was significant for ADHD and bipolar depression, for which she was prescribed sertraline during pregnancy. Mother had negative tests for parvovirus, Lyme, SSA/RO, and SS-B/LA antibodies and ANA. There was no known family history of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). No information on patient medical history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified Hepatitis B vaccine in the right thigh at birth (administration route unknown; batch number not provided), prior to newborn nursery discharge.  On an unknown date, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient kept her right knee and hip in a flexed position since discharge. The patient primary care provider initially believed refusal to move the right lower extremity was due to right hip flexor tightness. A hip ultrasound was normal. On an unknown date, at 10-days-of life, the patient presented to the Hospital and was noted to have right knee swelling. Her initial set of labs were significant for white cell count 11,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin 14.1 g/dl, platelets 463,000, ESR 18 mm/hr (normal less than 15 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein 4.1 mg/L (normal less than 8 mg/L). A knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a small moderate right knee effusion and no myositis or soft tissue fluid changes. Arthrocentesis was performed; culture was negative after 5 days. The patient remained afebrile throughout the hospital course and never received antibiotics. The patient was treated with ibuprofen 10 mg/kg/dose three times a day. Additional testing included negative Lyme titer, negative parvovirus IgG and IgM, normal ferritin, normal total IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, and negative ANA; however, the patient was found to have a positive HLA B27. The patient was discharged after 2 days following the negative evaluation and some increased knee range of motion. On follow-up, the patient was noted to have improvement of her right knee swelling and increased mobility of the right lower extremity. The patient was prescribed physical therapy. After 3 weeks of ibuprofen and physical therapy, the patient had significantly improved knee swelling and movement of the lower extremity; however, there was residual mild inflammation and stiffness of the knee. Since the patient had clinically improved, the family stopped ibuprofen despite recommendation to continue therapy. The family moved out of state shortly after the 2-month visit. Discussion with the patient's mother revealed a normal interval history, meeting all milestones and with an age-appropriate gait at age 13 months. A pediatric rheumatologist at the local hospital evaluated the patient, and no joint findings were identified. They recommended monitoring for recurrence of arthritis as the patient was positive for HLA B27. The patient mother also reported that the infant received all remaining vaccines, including the hepatitis B vaccine series, without any negative consequences. This case was considered as serious due to hospitalization. The authors commented: This case presents a very young infant who developed an inflammatory arthritis believed to be secondary to the initial hepatitis B vaccine. We present the first case in the literature of an infant who developed inflammatory arthritis soon after hepatitis B vaccination, similar to reports in the literature of adults with postvaccine articular complications. We considered the possibility that this child had a very early presentation of JIA in the presence of HLA B27 positivity. However, JIA typically would not demonstrate such significant improvement within 3 weeks using just NSAIDs. Additionally, there was no known family history of psoriasis or IBD, making other forms of JIA typically associated with HLA B27 less likely. Autoinflammatory diseases also need to be considered; however, our patient had no rash or fevers, and no such features were reported at the 13-month follow-up discussion. Molecular mimicry from adjuvants used to stimulate the immune response during vaccination may also play a role in developing autoimmunity as suggested in patients with multiple sclerosis or lupus, particularly in those who carry certain HLA haplotypes. We hypothesize there may be similar processes leading to the development of postvaccination inflammatory arthritis. It is possible that our patient had very early-onset JIA with an oligoarticular presentation. The different JIA subtypes include oligoarticular arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA). Our patient's presentation would be most consistent with oligoarticular JIA, which is most frequently seen in young females, although typically the ANA is positive rather than HLA B27. Oligoarticular JIA most frequently presents between 2 and 5 years of age. A review of the literature was completed to find the youngest documented cases of JIA. Identified studies report the youngest patients are 6 months of age typically. Some young patients are positive for HLA B27 although usually associated with the ERA subtype and not typically oligoarticular JIA as would be the diagnostic consideration in our patient. There are no reports of infants as young as our patient with JIA in the literature"". The authors commented ""This is the first reported case of an infant developing an inflammatory arthritis after receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. The patient most likely had vaccine-related inflammatory arthritis rather than JIA given the significant improvement after a short course of NSAIDs and lack of recurrence which would be expected if the arthropathy was due to early-onset JIA. There are reports of increased vulnerability to developing such an inflammatory or reactive arthritis in adult patients who are HLA B27 positive as in our patient. In addition, the literature suggests that the hepatitis B vaccination can unmask autoimmune processes in adult patients although this has not been reported in children. Healthcare providers must be aware of the rare occurrence of post-hepatitis B vaccine inflammatory ""reactive"" arthritis when caring for young children, especially those known to carry arthritis risk HLA alleles"".",,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,"Test Name: Antinuclear Antibodies; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:negative,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Total IgA; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Total IgG; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: total IgM; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: C-reactive protein; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:4.1,Unit:mg/L,Normal Low:less than 8,Normal High:); Test Name: Haemoglobin; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:14.1,Unit:g/dL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: HLA B27; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:positive,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: knee magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:a small moderate right knee effusion,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: parvovirus IgG and IgM; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:negative,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:463,000,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: ESR; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:18,Unit:mm/hr,Normal Low:less than 15,Normal High:); Test Name: ferritin; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: hip Ultrasound; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: White blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:11,000,Unit:cells/mm3,Normal Low:,Normal High:)",UNK,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Bipolar depression (patient's mother experienced during pregnancy and treated with sertraline); Pre-eclampsia; Premature baby (born at 36 weeks for maternal preeclampsia),,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2021GS,2,05/03/2021,,,,

It was reported that vaccine was not administered at military facility and vaccination facility type was hospital (reported as patient drove up to vaccine clinic). The patient's medical history included acute lymphocytic leukemia from 1992 to 1996 and not ongoing (she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor). No family medical history relevant to events was reported. The patient declined being sick at the time of vaccination. No patient's concomitant medications were reported. No prior vaccinations reported within four weeks. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient previously took gentamycin, amoxicillin and flu shot, culture specific to the flu (as reported), and she experienced allergy with all three on 1996. Patient said that she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor. She said that right after remission she developed a gentamycin allergy and, because of the gentamycin and amoxicillin allergy she was allergic to the flu shot, not the flu but the egg culture, because the egg culture can be that reaction. Patient also said that she had a reaction to a flu shot back in 1996 or something, it was the same rash that was with the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient had her first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 01Apr2021. She reported side effects of heavy breathing, racing heart, feeling woozy, rash, and pain at the injection site. It was reported that she would like more information and she wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. Patient had both an event to report and a question. She said she had done application, the first vaccine was 2 weeks before the present report and she was not supposed to get the second until this Thursday (19Apr2021), she needed to look at a calendar. She said 01Apr2021 was her first vaccine and that she did already report her events. She said she had a bad reaction that borderline sent her to the emergency room but she instead took a BENADRYL and she laid down and then felt really really really poor the next 5 days. She said she had a terrible reaction, she didn't feel like her throat was shut, her breathing was heavy, her voice was deep, her heart was racing, like she really had to work to breathe, not like losing her airway passage, just that she had to work to breathe, she had a heavy chest, chest pain, a racing heart. She said she could best correlate it to how feels like low blood sugar, like you are going to pass out. It was also reported that patient experienced woozy, about to pass out. She said she ended up what she'd call a vascular rash. She said it started in the thighs and spread down her legs. She said it was not a rash at the injection site, the rash was under the skin rather than a topical rash. She said she had a photo of it, that it seems like a vascular reaction. She would like to file a report with us because she said she felt like she did not get anything out, she had logged what happened to them and there was no correlation, no confirmation. She said she could send the photo to them. She said she was scared to get second vaccine, she wonders if she should do her due diligence to do second dose, or if she should skip it. She said there was no protocol in place, she had a telemedicine call with her doctor, there was no $200 fee due, her physician said it sounds like patient had more than a normal reaction. She said there were other things that are scary, her doctor told her she should speak to an allergist, but she said it would cost her like $600. She said she didn't feel good on immediate injection, she felt like she probably shouldn't be driving her car. She looked for her notes then she said her only normal reaction was a super painful injection site but not a rash. She said the vascular rash subsided with the use of BENADRYL. She said she could not afford an allergist to figure out what's going on. She asked why someone as small as her would get the same dose as a 200 pound man and why the doses of the vaccine were not specific to size or weight based. She also asked if based on symptoms will someone in the medical Information department advised her not to get the second dose. Events onset date were reported as 01Apr2021. The case was reported as non-serious by the consumer. No events required emergency room visit.

There was a situation with a young female that received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine last week that was unable to walk on 19Apr2021. She was unsure of where the patient received her Covid-19 vaccine. She was unsure if there were any co-factors that could have contributed to the patient's inability to walk.

The pharmacist inquired if there was any help that Pfizer could provide. She reported that she did not know if IViG, intravenous immunoglobin, had a place in therapy for the patient.
