The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor's office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn't fall, but he couldn't walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn't get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn't use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn't walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn't had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom's did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn't put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can't get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn't want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.

The batch number was not reported.  On 18-Nov-2020, next day after receiving Flucelvax Quadrivalent, the patient felt kind of off and not normal self. The patient's heart was racing.  On 19-Nov-2020, two days after receiving Flucelvax Quadrivalent, the patient did not feel right and when she went to take her medicine, the water spilled down her face when she tried to drink. The patient's face appeared droopy.  On 20-Nov-2020, three day after receiving Flucelvax Quadrivalent, the patient went to emergency room (ER) as her face was worse. The patient could not close her eye and throat felt it would close up. It was reported that the patient had Bell's palsy.   On an unspecified date in Nov-2020 (since as reported), the patient went to the doctor and asked if this would be permanent and the doctor told her that they did not know and that they would need to wait and see. There was nothing that could be done. The patient reported that she had disabled son who liked blowing bubbles and when he asked her to blow bubbles for him, she remembered that she could not blow or whistle. The patient needed to drink with a straw and was afraid that this would last for the rest of her life. The patient also could not breathe, she could not swallow, and the pain was up to her ear.  At the time of initial reporting on 10-Feb-2021, the patient was recovering from all events since that was not as bad as it was before.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment.  The event of 'Bell's palsy' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  Company comment: A 49-year-old patient was administered Flucelvax Quadrivalent. Next day after receiving Flucelvax Quadrivalent, the patient developed palpitations and felt kind off and not normal self. Two days after receiving Flucelvax Quadrivalent, the patient did not feel right and when she went to take her medicine, the water spilled down her face when she tried to drink.

She then went into remission and then got the cancer back, she doesn't know when. She knows they started treating it as the cancer had returned in Aug 2020), watering eyes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine), chemotherapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she is a cancer patient on chemotherapy), fever blister from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced she had bell's palsy and she does not know if she got this from the covid shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. on 02Feb2021, droop in her lip/mouth on 02Feb2021, her eye was still watering on 02Feb2021, there was a little puffing around the eye/ puffiness around her eye on 02Feb2021, double vision on an unspecified date, the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech on an unspecified date. Caller was calling about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She said on Friday 29Jan2021 she had the first shot at about 12:30. Her eye started watering in the morning Thursday the day before and she maybe assumed she was getting a cold in her eye but it was really runny and she got the shot. She was a cancer patient on chemo and she went to the doctor because she was supposed to get her chemo. That Tuesday morning she had a droopy lip on the right side and her eye was still watering, there was a little puffing around the eye and the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech so she thought stroke but she was going to get her chemo in an hour or 2 so she when they checked her she told them what happened, she was seeing the PA that day so she left and came back 10 minutes later and said she had talked to the doctor, they were not going to give chemo today and told her she had Bell's Palsy and she does not know if she got this from the COVID shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. This was her first shot so as a cancer patient on chemo should be getting the second shot 21Feb. She was concerned about taking that when she already has Bell's Palsy now, what else would it cause and then if she does not get it would she be 50 % protected. The doctor seemed to say she thought it was from the vaccine, but caller does not know because the eye watering began the day or 2 prior to getting the vaccine. Product details: She does not have the vaccine card right with her and she was using a walker to get up and down and so she was not able to provide NDC lot expiration right now. It would be available if needed at a later time. Indication: doctor said she should have it because she has no immune system. They don't know what to do they are just following what they told her and they were scared to death. The caller states she was a cancer patient on chemotherapy. She received her first Pfizer COVID-19 injection on Friday, 29Jan2021. Prior to the vaccine, her eye had been watering Thursday or Friday morning before she had shot, it was just her right eye. On Tuesday, 02Feb2021, she developed a droop in her mouth and puffiness around her eye and so forth. Caller clarified it was just on the right side and with her right eye. She also has double vision in her right eye. She got up in the morning on 02Feb2021, and her husband was in the other room and told her that she sounded funny. She explained to her husband her mouth was dry and she was kind of slurring her speech. Her husband came into the room she was in and said, ""huh, your lip was drooping"". Since it was in the morning and she had no other symptoms besides the talking funny and the puffiness around her eye, she didn't take it as a stroke. She figured she would just until she went to her chemotherapy appointment she had the same day, 02Feb2021. She went into her appointment and showed the person and gave her information on what happened. The person wanted an MRI of the brain to make sure she didn't have cancer there or cancer anywhere else up in that area and also that she didn't have a stroke. She confirms the MRI was fine, both were negative for any signs of this. She was told she developed bell's palsy. She has a drooping lip. The caller was concerned about her second shot. She wants to know should she getting the second vaccine, because the person at the (institution name) office (where she receives her chemotherapy) believes the bell's palsy came from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was supposed to have chemotherapy that day (02Feb2021), but they wouldn't give it to her then, but she did have it done yesterday. Caller explains she has no NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the chemotherapy she receives. She isn't given any stuff with any numbers and she gets numerous medications. Patient's Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination): Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine because as she was sitting waiting to receive her injection, she remembers wiping her eye and thinking to herself, ""I wish this eye would quit watering"". Caller states she had a fever blister, but she was not quite sure about when this appeared. She doesn't know if she had developed the fever blister before or the next day after receiving the vaccine, she was not quite sure. The any events were not required a visit to Emergency Room. She went to the Oncology Office for her chemotherapy appointment. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller had the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on 02Feb2021 showed she didn't have a stroke and no cancer of the brain.

We had been reading chapter books, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory before the vaccine, about a week after the vaccine, he was no longer able to remember the names of the characters or follow the plot.  We'd been reading books like James and the Giant Peach, Winnie the Pooh, the Jungle Book, for over 6 months and discussing them at length.  He lost this ability.  We went back to reading picture books that he'd loved 2 years before.   About 2 weeks after the vaccine, around christmas, he started losing his balance.  He was falling multiple times a day.  He fell down a few half-flights of stairs. In early Jan. 2019, I took him to the ER because he said ""There was a flash of light and I lost my thinking."" and he fell down an entire flight of stairs.  I took him to his pediatrician for a follow up and to try to find out if he might be having seizures.    Both the pediatrician and I noticed an eye-roll tic that showed up about the same time. I felt that this was related to the falls and what I believe is seizure activity.  His sleep is different around the times that he has these falls, and his language is different- he regresses.  I was referred to a neurologist, and we followed up with a 24-hour EEG in 10/19. He did not have any seizures while in the hospital, he does have BECTS brainwaves.    We have no way of treating any of this, as seizure disorders can only be diagnosed if a seizure is actually seen.  His cognitive decline stopped after about 2 months, and by the end of Feb. 2019, he was again learning and moving forward.  He was able to start reading books like Charlie and the Chocolate factory in fall of 2019-- a year later.",,,,,,,,Y,N,12/13/2018,12/18/2018,5,"We visited his pediatrician in Jan. 2019.

Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .

I treated the lips with vaseline but did not see any outward appearance of a rash or redness. The arm pain lasted two days and the lip issue resolved approximately 5 days later.

I went to my PCP on 2/22/2021 who was very concerned as he had not seen anything like this before.

I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it's charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm.

Slightly elevated but not bad.  No pain.  A little itchy but not bad.  So I googled it quickly today and I find out that it's not all that uncommon and likely more common than you realize because most guys aren't going to take the time to report something like this, in my opinion.   I see that some of the health care workers are being quoted as saying it's probably either an allergic reaction to a vaccine ingredient or an immune system reaction.  In my opinion it's the latter, at least with respect to me as several years ago after being bitten by a honeybee in palm of hand in fat part near thumb a similar thing happened.where it hurt and was red for a day or two or three and then seemed to recede but then came back with a red mark bigger than before, but it didn't hurt much, more of an itch if I recall correctly.  So for some reason that's apparently how my immune system fights off something foreign.  I have type A blood I believe, if that matters.  I think I have a pretty good strong immune system for my age, as well.  Hopefully the second shot will not produce that much more of a reaction because of this or how I'm reacting now to the first shot.  No big deal just a lot of unknowns.

She said her husband's doctors know that the rash was not precipitated by the COVID-19 Vaccine, but his rash did get worse after he got the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. His second dose was due 16Feb2021. The reporter was wondering if she should delay the second dose of the vaccine, the vaccine would make the rash worse.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the rash worsened after 2 days following the vaccine use thus a contributory role of BNT162B2 might not be fully excluded towards the event onset.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product and Rash faded soon under Prednisone.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.

She states she didn't even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that's why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years.

"" Per event report provided by RN ""I was called out to the waiting room for pt that was passing out. Pt had her Tdap, Flu injections, and her 50gm glucose test 30 mins prior so she was waiting out in the waiting room. I walked out pt was lowered to the floor with the assistance of 2 CMAs after they found her shaking and rocking in the chair in the waiting room and unable to walk to a exam room. I asked pt her name and starting rubbing her back to try and stimulate her into talking because she was in and out of consciousness. I asked staff to call for assistance and to tell someone to call 911 services. I assisted pt to her side and put a pillow under her head. We tried to get a blood pressure x2 unsuccessfully Pts pulse was 61 BPM and weak when I took it manually. Dr. then came out and I gave report to her from what I saw and interventions I did to keep her talking and conscious through incident. Dr. then did her assessment and pt stated ""she couldn't breathe"" and ""feels like her tongue was swelling"" very limited communication took place because of pt being so weak and unable to exert that much energy. At that time Dr.  asked for and Epi-Pen, oxygen and vital machine. Dr.  asked staff to try to get another blood pressure reading on pt with the machine and again was unsuccessful pt pulse ox ranged to 70s-90s. Dr. then administer the Epi-pen in pt's left thigh and administered O2 by oxygen re-breather mask. Pt's random glucose reading was 140s, FHT was detected with a handheld doppler of 150s while waiting for EMT services. EMT's were taking the Pt out of the building. Report was given by Dr. to EMT's and provided snapshot of Pt's information, and gave report to OB team at the ED.""",,,,,Y,5,,,Y,02/05/2021,02/05/2021,0,,PVT,,"Glucose for OB glucose tolerance test.

1051862,02/24/2021,MN,12.0,12,,F,,"My daughter was an active, happy, healthy pre-teen. Her doctor had recommended she get the HPV vaccine and since my oldest daughter had done it I just figured why wouldn't I do it to her. I am a nurse and I just always trusted the doctors, never did any research into the vaccines, never read the vaccine papers that were given to me.  Well with my youngest daughter things possibly are different for her and I never put two and two together until I was doing research on this covid vaccine and found so many amazing people activating on behalf of all the vaccine injured people and I can't believe how many there are. So I was listening to one doctor and she was talking about ingredients in the hpv vaccine I knew from research I had done on my daughter's health that those were hormones they put in there and I had an instant red flag and bad gut feeling. So I finished listening and I truly with all my heart believe she is a vaccine injured patient that the doctors just shrugged off as stuff happens in life and that is just the card you were dealt. I don't believe that is the case.   So my daughter had her HPV vaccines starting when she was only sweet 11 on 9/18/14 then again on 11/10/14 and her last one was on 4/9/15. Well after those is when her young life changed forever and I mean FOREVER.  On March 18, 2016 she had extreme sharp pains in her lower left pelvic area and it was so bad she would throw up. Me being a OB nurse I was thinking of a cyst but many of the doctors I worked for would say they will go away on their own. Well she didn't get any better for a while but then she laid down and fell asleep and I let her rest and I said if she wakes up and feels like that again I will take her in. I knew I wanted her to have an internal U/S so I called the clinic in the morning to see if they had one and they didn't so I knew I had to take her to the ER. Well when she got up and started moving to go to the ER the pain came back again and she would throw up.  So we got to the hospital and in short it took forever for them to get her set up with an IV and give her some dang pain meds my sweet 13 year old was suffering. Once her bladder was full they did an u/s and found a cyst. So they scheduled emergency surgery and found she had a Torsed Ovary. When they got in there they saw her ovary was twisted 3 times but they were able to untie it and save it and there were some big cysts there as well that they removed. They also found she had endometriosis on her right side. The torsed ovary was on her left side. So they burnt off the endometriosis and then said she was all good. It was very scary but the doctor reassured us she was good to go and the chances of this ever happening again was very slim. He put her on the depo provera shot to help with the endometriosis which caused even more problems and now I know that was not a necessary medical intervention on his part at all.  Then believe it or not almost 2 years to the date so patient was almost 15 she had that bad pain again and started throwing up. We went straight to the ER and the doctor who did her first surgery happened to be on call again and many hours later he came in and checked on her and had her do an internal u/s again. The u/s tech couldn't find anything and the doctor did a pelvic examination and said there was nothing wrong. Pretty much saying it was all in her head. She was in so much pain and she knew in her gut it was happening again and she told him that but he told her there was nothing there. So she went home on pain meds and came back the next morning early because the pain was so bad. The ER doctor said there has to be something wrong because she was on pain meds cancer patients use but wasn't even helping her pain. I think then he hooked her up to IV, gave her some meds and changed or added another pain medicine I can't remember forsure. A couple days went by with this same pain and I called our regular doctor to see her and he ordered her a CT scan and we followed up the next day with a OB that saw patient when she was in the hospital for observation that wow they failed her that is forsure and she said there was a cyst but if she wasn't in so much pain she wouldn't recommend surgery but since she is in so much pain she sent us back to the doctor that saw her in the ER and did her previous surgery. I want to say the cyst was 10cm I don't know how the dang u/s tech did not see it. She should have been fired. I wish I would have sued them all.  Anyways she saw the OB doctor that did her surgery on Friday and made her go through this extreme pain until Monday when he had surgery rotation to do it. I can't even believe I let him do this to her. I will always feel like I should have done more for her but at the time I felt I was. Anyways let me remind you over this wait weekend my daughter turned a young 15  and then had her surgery on Monday.  The worst thing ever happened that day. The doctor came and asked me to come to a room to talk and there he told me that her entire left side had to be taken out and they had to cut her open like a c-section because it was all falling apart. At the age of 15 she lost her left ovary, fallopian tube.

This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don't think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I'm sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.",Y,02/19/2021,Y,,Y,18,,,N,01/25/2021,01/26/2021,1,Bacterial pneumonia,SEN,,"A variety of medications for diabetes, blood circulation, hypertension","Diabetes, hypertension, cancer (lung)",cancer for many years.,Breathing issues ~2 weeks after first dose of mRNA vaccine in the series but were not nearly as acute or severe as they were fol,,2,02/24/2021,,,Y,none

The nurse had just driven up within that 15 minutes when the neighbor called stating the patient was confused. This was completely out of character for her.

Once I drank some water, I could feel the liquid Tylenol on the back of my throat get washed down  and I was able to breath normally in about 2 minutes.   The cup of liquid Tylenol still had about 20 ml of fluid in it and I spit out perhaps half of what entered my mouth; I'm estimating that 5 ml of liquid Tylenol went down  my throat.
