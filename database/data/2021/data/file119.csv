Pain would drop away throughout the day, but return at night about an hour and a half after going to bed. Pain continued to get worse over the course of about two months. Exercising with weights made the problem worse. Aerobic exercise did not effect the problem. I was an avid runner before getting vaccinated, but have since reduced my runs to about 3 times a week running about 2-3 miles at a time. At this time after about 7 months, I still have minor pain, but it is very minor. It can still occasionally be a problem lying on my right side. I continue to improve very slowly.

1735082,09/25/2021,GA,72.0,72,,M,,"Within 2-3 weeks after injection, PT began noticing blurred vision, color distortion, flashing lights around perimeter of eye, extreme sensitivity to light and gooey discharge from left eye. Thus began endless appts, tests and eye surgery. In the 6 months following the onset of his issues, he has seen his regular opthamologist, a glaucoma specialist and a retinal specialist for a total of 9 times and not one has determined what is causing his vision issues.At his regular eye appt on January 13, 2021, his vision was perfect and his glaucoma pressures were 10 in right eye and 21 in the left eye, which was in the realm of what they had checked since being diagnosed in 1984. He made an appointment with his opthamologist for 4/14/2021 to see if he could shed some light on the issues he is having. The office called and moved the appt to 4/22. At that appt, his pressures were 24 in his right eye (not the affected eye at that time) and 25 in his left eye. His left eye was extremely irritated so the doctor prescribed steroid drops to help calm down the irritation but could not make a determination for why the eye was irritated and the pressures were up, not to mention patient could hardly see the letters on the eye chart.He saw the opthamologist again on 5/19/2021 to see if the drops had helped. There was no improvement in vision or pressure. The pressures were 23 in R eye and 30 in left eye. The doctor recommended PT see a glaucoma specialist. They couldn't see him until 6/28/2021. At that appointment, his pressures were 22 in R and 36 in Left.Dr. preformed a visual field and recommended that drainage tubes (shunts) be inserted to drain fluid and relieve pressure. The surgery was scheduled for 7/27/2021. On 7/28/2021, PT returned to the doctor's office for a follow-up visit to check the surgery results. The pressure in his left eye was 29. Right wasn't checked. On 8/23/2021, PT had an appt with Dr. again and the left eye pressure was 25, which historically was not a good pressure for PT's left eye. However, the doctor seemed pleased that it had come down a few points in a month. The doctor still could not explain why the vision was still blurred and eye irritated, colors distorted and the flashing was still occurring. We decided to go to his opthamologist on 8/30/2021 and see if he could maybe correct the vision with glasses for right now. PT couldn't read the eye chart and during the exam, Dr. found a hole in his macula in his right eye and a warp in the macula in his left eye. His pressures were good at 16 and 15. Dr.. referred him to a retinal specialist. On 9/02/2021, PT saw retinal specialist, and the pressures checked 18 in the R eye and 23 in the L eye. He explained about a vitrectomy procedure which would repair the hole in the macula in the right eye. Needless to say, we are extremely discouraged at the inability to diagnose what has caused the blurred vision and other symptoms he is experiencing. He told retinal specialist he would have to think about the vitrectomy because his left eye is incapacitated now and if he has this procedure, he would be incapacitated in both eyes for a while. We have another appointment with the glaucoma specialist and the retinal specialist. We are hoping there is no permanent damage done but, at this time, we cannot say that there isn't.

Nothing would stop them, not Motrin, Tylenol, or Aleve. I tried lying in a dark room, cool compresses, warm compresses, no sound, soothing music, nothing would stop them. Since I have a history of Renal Cell cancer and the headaches were continuing, I was worried that I might have brain metastasis. I saw my oncologist on August 10, 2021. Dr.  ordered an MRI of the brain just to check. I had my MRI on August 30, 2021. It was normal. My headaches are continuing. Sometimes, they are painful, and I have to go lie down. They continue to be 3-5 times per week.",,,,,,,,,N,01/16/2021,01/16/2021,0,"Labwork at endocrinologist-WNL 4/20/21 MRI of the Brain-WNL, 8/30/2021",PVT,,"Biotin, Turmeric, Multivitamin, Zinc, Vitamin C",none,"HTN, Thyroid polyps, Hx Supraventricular tachycardia, Hx Renal Call Cancer 4/2018",,,2,09/26/2021,,Y,,"Codeine, Hydrocodone, Sulfa, Hibiclens"

On the 11th that is when myself  took ill all with the same symptoms except no dirrieha, vomiting and I lost both smell and taste. And by this time my son got worse. On Sunday the 12th is when my husband took sick, with the same symptoms as me. We all got covid test that came back postive. Now NO ONE in my house goes anywhere unless that have a mask.

This worries me even more. No one that my children at school have came down with it. And they were all check for being in close contact with my kids, and same with our roommates work. Everyone came back negtive that worked around him and kids that were around mine. Now I'm not agaisnt the vaccine. But this alone scared the crap out of me.

This report concerned a 9 decade old female of unspecified race and ethnic origin. The objective of this study was to describe Immunogenicity of Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccination followed by J&J adenovirus COVID-19 vaccination in two CLL patients. The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient's concurrent conditions included: mild hypogammaglobulinemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and other pre-existing medical conditions included no history of recurring infections or need for IgG supplementation. The patient was previously treated with obinutuzumab.

The batch number was not reported and has been requested. Concomitant medications included BNT 162 for prophylactic vaccination, and ibrutinib. The patient self-referred and received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s 81 days after completion of the BNT162 vaccine series (intentional product misuse and off label use). After 27 days following third vaccine additional samples were taken. It was reported that patient did not had pre-vaccination B-cell responses as measured by RBD-specific antibodies or MBC (Memory B-Cells) and did not had virus-specific CD8+ response at baseline. The patient had spike peptide-reactive CD4+ T-cells at baseline these cells were unresponsive and did not expand following vaccination. In contrast, CD8+ responses were observed after mRNA vaccination in the patient. Approximately four weeks after initial vaccination the patient had detectable RBD-specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or MBCs. The had measurable vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cell responses following mRNA vaccination, although CD4+ responses did not appear to increase above the baseline. The patient did not seroconvert or had detectable virus specific MBCs after their primary mRNA vaccination series however had a spike-specific CD8+ T-cell response that further boosted after a 3rd dose and a virus-specific CD4+ response that didn't change following original vaccine series or 3rd dose of J&J. The patient had undergone previous treatment (6 years ago) with obinutuzumab an anti-CD20 mAb and is currently on active treatment with Ibrutinib, since 2017. Both had baseline B-cell frequencies outside of the normal range. The patient had a low percentage of naive B-cells (11.37) and MBCs (0.45). Although the patient had mild hypogammaglobulinemia, the patient did not had history of recurring infection or need for IgG supplementation. The Levels of baseline CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (absolute values) were also normal, prior to vaccination (data not presented). The patient had very low percentage of naive B cells which could explains the initial poor response to vaccination. The patient had an increase in virus specific CD8+ T-cells.

When my husband came home from work for lunch later that day, I asked him if his vision was hazy or blurry after his second dose. He said no; so again I just brushed it off and forgot about it. Then that evening around 5:30 pm, I was feeling a little headache pulse behind my left ear and I was feeling tired. I asked my husband to take a picture of me because I wanted to see how tired I looked. It was then that I noticed my eyes were asymmetrical; one looked different with a droopy eye lid (kind of like a lazy-eye look). My vision still felt a little off so I went inside to start cooking. 20 minutes later I felt like my vision was normal and eventually went to sleep. The next day I woke up and felt like symptoms were all gone, until I remembered my right eye situation. I looked in the mirror and the right eye was still asymmetrical (droopy lid). It feels like the right eye is having to work harder. It is hard to explain but the right eye does not feel normal to me. I made an appt with an eye doctor that day and my vision checked out ok but she did diagnose ptosis of the right eyelid.

I reacted more adversely to the 2nd dose:  Much more swelling & pain at the injection site (size of a walnut), the next day I had fever of 100.6, body aches and chills, had to go to bed for the rest of the day after the injection.  Felt tired for a couple days, but all in all, not that bad.  I knew the reaction was a sign of actual immunity being built up, so I have no complaint.  Two adverse physical rxns a couple months after the shots:  1) I think I got a mild case of Covid toes mid-March through April, and was completely gone by early May.  I did not have any new shoes, and I do not get swelling of the cuticles or bruising like this was.  It progressed from painful red swelling to dark red, purplish to almost black small blood blisters before it resolved.  Never had that before.  I did not see a physician for it.  I saw pictures of mild cases on the internet and didn't think it was of much consequence.  2)  In April, 2021 I suddenly developed a very stiff left jaw that for a couple weeks made crunchy sounds.  The cracking stopped, but the joint became very painful all the way up into the left ear and my ability to open my mouth was much decreased.  I couldn't bit down on tough to chew food.  I didn't have good insurance coverage at the time, so I did not see a doctor about it.  The stiffness and radiating pain to my left ear jaw worsened over May & June, needed to take ibuprofen to handle the pain.  I figured it was TMJ - and can be related to stress which of course we all have through this pandemic.   I got Medicare in July, so I consulted my dentist and an ENT about it, but decided not to do a bite guard because I do not grind my teeth at night.  Interestingly, the symptoms have lessened since early August and I am almost back to normal now.

Nothing unusual on day two, same as the first two shots, red welt at injection site with tenderness.  On the third day, which was Wednesday,  the red welt now extended out 5 inch circle but nothing else from injection site.    Thursday started the rash on my tummy and from then on continued to crop up on different parts of my body with intense itching, small blisters and some areas of angry red welts.  By Sunday morning  it reached a crescendo with me, intense rashes now all over my torso, behind my knee, upon my shoulder and backside.  Contacted Pfizer and they took a report and gave us a incident report # U8NA0WZM.  I researched online and found out that one of the side affects of the vaccine is a rash usually on first or second dose.  Since this is new...booster shot....no information was available. The itching and pain was very intense so I took Benadryl tablets and Benadryl gel to relieve some of the intense itching.    We could literally follow the path of the vaccine as blisters and rash started on the left side of the body and each day proceeded down and then around to the right side of the body, the right side not being as severe as the left side.  Woke up this morning, Monday September 27th  and found two new small areas that cropped up on my leg and arm on the right side .  Contacted our primary care doctor this morning and emailed her pictures of the rash to get her opinion and to keep them recorded in my files.

Could not lift high enough to even view the watch on my wrist. The next morning I woke up and still had a fever - I had not connected at that point that it could be from the vaccination so I actually went and had a Covid test done (was negative). My shoulder area continued to have great pain and I had almost no range of motion in that arm. I went to a routine doctor visit on 9/8 and mentioned to the nurse (who happened to be the same person who administered the vaccination) and she said I was probably just sore because I am small in stature. (I am 5'2"", normally around 120-125 lbs.) I tried to ""push through it"" and hoped it would get better. After it continued to bother me and wake me all through the nights, I emailed my doctor on 9/9 to let her know something did not feel normal. On 9/10 I went back to Health where she indicated I may have frozen shoulder. Xrays were performed and she massaged my arm to get it moving a little more. After this I had bruising from my shoulder to my elbow, but my range of motion was better. As of today, I can move my arm much more but still have to modify movements at the gym and still have pain in my shoulder - especially when I lift my arm directly above my head - it is painful.

Soft tissues:Unremarkable Cord:The cervical cord demonstrates no abnormal signal changes. C2-C3: No significant central canal narrowing is identified. No significant neural foraminal narrowing is identified. C3-C4: No significant central canal narrowing is identified. Mild right uncovertebral hypertrophy results in minimal right neural foraminal narrowing. C4-C5: No significant central canal narrowing is identified. Bilateral uncovertebral hypertrophy results in minimal bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C5-C6: Diffuse disc bulge with suggestion of advanced bilateral uncovertebral hypertrophy resulting in mild-to-moderate central canal narrowing and bilateral at least moderate neural foraminal narrowing. Minimal ventral cord effacement may be present without abnormal cord signal changes. C6-C7: Broad-based diffuse disc bulge results in mild to moderate central canal narrowing. Bilateral uncovertebral particularly resulting in mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C7-T1: Minimal right asymmetric disc bulge results in minimal right thecal sac effacement. No significant central canal narrowing. T2-T3: tiny left paracentral disc protrusion abuts the left ventral cord with mild effacement without abnormal signal changes. IMPRESSION: C5-C6 diffuse disc bulge with suggested advanced bilateral uncovertebral hypertrophy resulting in mild-to-moderate central canal narrowing with minimal ventral cord effacement without abnormal signal changes.

These did help the headache slightly better but gave me stomach issues. Had MRI on 5/17, with normal results. Over the next month relied on family to help my family survive, as I mostly laid in bed. Finally began to feel better and was able to slowly wean off strong meds.

The patient developed fatigue and URI symptoms around 8/11. He tested positive for COVID on 8/11. He was able to be arranged to have monoclonal antibody treatment on 8/12.  Patient reports that since his monoclonal antibody treatment that he has continued to have ongoing fatigue.  He  has also had ongoing cough, fever,  and body aches.  Patient was seen by his PCP on day of presentation and reportedly had oxygen saturations in the high 80's.  Patient was then instructed to present to the ED for further evaluation.  The patient was admitted to the COVID step-down unit.  He received 5 days of remdesivir and dexamethasone.  The patient was initially on 4 L, but quickly over the last several days we have been able to wean him down significantly really to almost room air.  Today, the patient has actually gotten to room air, but when he gets up, he does desaturate with ambulation.  His creatinine was slightly elevated when he was admitted, his ARB was held because his blood pressure was a little soft.  His creatinine went from 1.3 down to 1.1 upon discharge.  Also, his platelet count was slightly low when he was admitted, which is fairly common with COVID-19.  His platelet count was initially 108, but on the day of discharge it had already rebounded to 148.    He is eating and drinking.  He had had a bowel movement, which is not  uncommon for him.  He has struggled with constipation at home. He is eating and drinking.  He had had a bowel movement, which is not  uncommon for him.  He has struggled with constipation at home.    In terms of his diabetes, the patient was taken off his Jardiance and his glipizide along with his metformin while he is in the hospital.  Obviously, he had some elevation of his glucose, is related to the dexamethasone.  I think that will probably resolve itself after he finishes tape his dexamethasone course.   The patient feels well.  He qualified for 1-2 L of oxygen mostly when he ambulates.  He did get down to 86, when he ambulated.  I basically outlined him that he will probably need it for 1-2 weeks.

Felt fine with no issues until about 2-3 weeks later, a rash on my arm started to show up. It started circular in shape and was pearly white in the middle with a red on the outside of the circle and was raised like a welt. It started on the upper part of my arm and then spread across my shoulders and down my torso, but didn't go below my waist. My doctor said it was definitely a reaction to something. Right around the same time, they put me on a new medication (an anti depressant), so he told me to stop taking that and I did. It then continued to itch and the rash persisted for months and during that time, I went through two rounds of oral steroids and took multiple Benadryl a day to help with the itching and sort of quell the rash. I was then told I needed to see a dermatologist. When I saw them (this was 5 to 6 months post the initial reaction, they  only provided me some cream that didn't really work. Over the course of the first 1-4 months after the rash showed up (March to July), the rash changed from something looking like a mobilliform rash, to something that looked like shingles, then something that looked like pityriasis rosea, then eczema. But the time I got to the dermatologist, the worst of it had gone away. So she gave me a steroid shot and some cream (Triamcinolone Acetonide) and said if it didn't get better to call them back and they'd look at me again. I've called them but they haven't called me back, so I'm working with my PCP to see if they can refer me to someone else. I got my booster vaccine on August 20th, 2021 (Pfizer, EW0175) and now the rash is starting to return again, and I'm trying to get into my doctor but I am having difficulties doing so.

Fever; chills; muscle aches; 4-13-21 through 4-15-21. All the symptoms of my previous Covid-19 returned. These included elevated heart rate; dry eyes; difficulty with bowel movements. I continued to have daily pain in my left arm. This pain was elevated evenings. This pain finally subsided in June 2021. I had soreness under my right arm which continued from my first Covid-19 vaccine from March 16, 2021. I still experience pain under my right arm. On May 3, 2021 at 10:45 am I experienced an episode of heartburn unlike any previously experienced. I am not prone to heartburn continued: This episode was so extreme that I had to stop at a pharmacy and purchase rolaids. My elevated heart rate continued and became quite alarming. On June 1, 2021 my heart rate was 143 just driving my car. I was seen by Dr. June 2, 2021. My blood pressure was high (without hypertension). The procedures I received included: A) Primary Procedure:Health Panel (Multiple Blood Tests) (General health panel This panel must include the following: Comprehensive metabolic panel Blood count, complete (CBC), automated and automated differential WBC count B) Primary Procedure:Fibrin D-dimer Test (Fibrin degradation products, D-dimer; quantitative). I also received an ECG. I was referred for a 24 heart monitor. This did not show any heart rhythm irregularities; however, my heart rate was a still a bit high. I have been monitoring my blood pressure since and it has steadily decreased to normal. On September 10, 2021 my blood pressure was 107/71. My heart rate has also improved steadily. Now when I am sitting it is in the 70's to 80's range.

After the stem cell injection, all limitations to memory recall were gone, and I could recall all memories I had. No barriers. I was thrilled.

I was hospitalized again on June 6th due to similar symptoms and my liver function levels were in the 1400s again. According to a Physician, they believe my pancreatic episode was never resolved from April to June. They found a blockage and narrowing in my biliary duct, so a GI doctor placed a stent in my biliary duct. The stent was too small and ended up backing bile back into my body, making me worse, so they placed a larger stent (10cm). I still suffered from nausea and reduced appetite due to vomiting. I had the stent removed in August 2021 and they determined possible autoimmune hepatitis as an underlying issue and I am in the process of getting a liver biopsy currently.

1737814,09/27/2021,WA,40.0,40,,M,,"My roommate and I got the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine at about the same time. He got his the day before I did. A few days after the second dose, he started complaining about pneumonia. He went to the doctor to get antibiotics and steroids for it. The next day, I also got sick; but at the time I had no health insurance so I could not see a doctor about it. Symptoms: headache, sore throat, fatigue, dizziness, loss of appetite, fever, bad wet cough, pneumonia, shallow breathing, temporary loss of smell/taste, permanent reduction in sense of smell and muscle aches. Mainly symptoms were contained to the respiratory area. Usually if it's allergies the symptoms are mainly in my sinuses, but my head was clear this time. Starting on the second day after my vaccine (2nd dose), I had a bit of a sore throat and headache but didn't think too much of it.  It felt like I might be getting a ""head cold"" later, which happens a lot because of my seasonal allergies but they are typically not too bad and can be avoided by taking an antihistamine.  So I took a Benadryl when I got home. Then about two hours later I was having dinner in my kitchen, when all of a sudden it just hit me hard. A wave of fatigue and dizziness, followed by a long coughing fit. I could feel the fluid in my lungs along with the cough. I had to lie down or I likely would have passed-out. And within twenty minutes I had all the symptoms I previously listed. It stayed that bad for three days so I went to drive-through pharmacy and was tested for the COVID vaccine, results came back negative for that.  It stayed that bad for one more day after I got tested, then it gradually started to get a little bit better - at least the fatigue and dizziness weren't so bad and my sense of smell started coming back.  But I stayed sick for 11 days straight, had to ""self-quarantine"" because it was so bad. My immune system is stronger than average. I haven't even had the flu since I was seven (not for more than a day at least). It's so strong that it's attacking my own skin faster than the skin can heal now. It also results in having pretty serious allergies to tree pollen and pet dander. Usually illness that would make someone else sick for a whole week, I only get it for a day - maybe two days if it comes with digestive problems, too. So this is a very unusual experience for me to get sick like this. Literally it was so bad that I started to wish that someone would come in and just kill me.  The single most awful experience of my life. My roommate and I both got tested for the COVID-19 virus on the same day. We went to different branches of the pharmacy for the testing, and both got cleared with negative results. It could just be coincidental timing that my roommate and I both got some other respiratory infection just two days after the vaccine. I suspect it was more likely a result of the vaccine: reduced immune response, or increased susceptibility, or something like that.  I suspect as much partly because of the timing, but mostly because of the severity of it. I just never get sick like that. The fast onset of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and the extended duration of it makes me think that either it is related to the vaccine, or we actually got COVID-19 but for some reason the contagion test didn't pick up on it. In addition, after both doses (worse after the second one) I had a lot of pain and swelling at/near the injection site.  I received the injections in my upper arms (one on each side) and most of the arm was very stiff and sore after each injection for two days for the first dose and three days for the second dose, starting early on the day after the injection. I apologize for the delay in getting this form done.  I've been meaning to do it since I got sick but I just kept getting distracted by other things and I'd forget about it, then remember again when I'm too busy to sit down and finish the paperwork so I'd forget again.",,,,,,,,,Y,06/27/2021,06/29/2021,2,"COVID-19 test (negative result) - tested on or about 07/02 (I think), at the same facility where I received the vaccine.",PHM,,"Metformin, over-the-counter multivitamin","Type 2 diabetes, hidradenitis suppurativa (hurley stage 3)","Type 2 diabetes, hidradenitis suppurativa (hurley stage 3)",,,2,09/25/2021,,Y,,"Digestive allergies: Sulfates, ginger, oxy/hydrocodone, seasonal respiratory allergies (tree pollen mostly)"

The Journal of Emergency Medicine. 2021 Aug 07;1-5. This report concerned a 38-year-old male of unspecified race and ethnic origin. The objective of this report was to describe a case of an atypical presentation of GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) presenting with extremity paresthesias, dysarthria, and bilateral facial weakness in the absence of classic ascending limb weakness, and discuss differential diagnosis, triage, and management. The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient's concurrent conditions included: Anxiety, depression, alcohol user (average of 6 to 8 beers per day), and marijuana user (daily). The patient had been in a state of good health upon receipt of the vaccine 32 days prior. The patient received covid-19 vaccine adv26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: unknown, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose, start therapy date were not reported, 1 total administered for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety and depression. On an unspecified date, approximately 2 weeks after vaccination, the patient experienced subacute, rapidly progressive, numbness and tingling in the tongue, lips, bilateral hands and feet/ paresthesias. Two days prior to presentation the patient began to develop difficulty moving his mouth, forming words/ dysarthria/slurred speech, bilateral facial weakness/ facial diplegia/bilateral facial nerve palsy in a lower-motor-neuron pattern with acral paresthesias variant and an absence of classic ascending limb weakness, as well as difficulty drinking from a straw and controlling the lips, cheeks and tongue while eating. The review of systems was notable for headaches, mild gait unsteadiness, generalized fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. The patient denied diplopia, dysphagia, or dysphonia, chest pain or palpitations, lightheadedness, fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, urinary or bowel incontinence and falls or other trauma. The patient visited the emergency department in a clinically good condition, not in acute distress and was ambulating independently. Initial vital signs were as follows, blood pressure 218/80 mmHg, heart rate 85 beats/min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient exhibited weak eye closure bilaterally and inability to smile or puff cheeks against resistance. The extraocular movements were intact and tongue was midline without fasciculations. Strength in the upper and lower extremities were intact (5/5) as sensation to light touch throughout. There was no dysmetria or gait ataxia. Deep tendon reflexes were reduced 1 plus in the lower extremities and only faintly present in the bilateral upper extremities. Laboratory data were notable for a white blood cell count of 12.25 x 10E3/mL with a normal differential, hemoglobin of 16.7 gram per deciliter, and a hematocrit of 49.5 L/L. The serum chemistries including liver function test, thyroid-stimulating hormone, folate, and B12 (Cobalamin), were all within normal limits. Urine toxicology/ Urine drug screen test was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol and covid-19 polymerase chain reaction was negative. A neurology consultation was obtained. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast and constructive interference in steady state (CISS) sequencing revealed focal enhancement of the bilateral internal auditory canal fundi which carried the CN-VII (cranial nerve) and CN-VIII and the bilateral cisternal segments of the trigeminal nerves. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed glucose of 73 mg/dL, an elevated protein to 181 mg/dL, and 7 nucleated cells/high-power field (HPF; corrected for 2987 red blood cells/HPF), constituting albuminocytological dissociation suggestive of atypical Guillain-Barre syndrome. The electrodiagnostic evaluation was not performed as the CSF profile and clinical presentations were definitive of GBS. The patient was hospitalized and received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) over 2 days to a total dose of 2 grams per kilo gram body weight, which showed a mild improvement in his symptoms. Measurements of negative inspiratory force was performed daily, and the patient had not developed any signs or symptoms of respiratory compromise. On hospital day 1, the patient developed new hyponatremia, which had reached a value of 124 mEq/L (milliequivalents per litre) during admission which was concluded to be multifactorial, attributed to pseudohyponatremia in the setting of IVIG as well as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone in the setting of GBS. The patient was treated with fluid restriction and salt tabs with improvement in sodium to 134 mEq/L on discharge. The patient's symptoms showed no further progression and was discharged home on hospital day 4. The duration of hospitalization were 4 days. The discharge examination was notable for stable to improvement in bilateral facial weakness and dysarthria with generalized areflexia. The author concludes that the patient received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine against the COVID-19 virus 32 days prior to presentation. In the Johnson and Johnson COVID19 vaccine trial, one case of GBS in the post-vaccination arm was reported, however, there was also a case of GBS in the placebo arm. This did not imply a causal association between the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and GBS. Author cannot say definitively whether the patient's prior vaccination contributed to his development of GBS or was incidental to it. The risk of developing vaccine-associated GBS remains very low when viewed across the general population, and cases of GBS with a temporal association to vaccination are not necessarily caused by a vaccine-mediated immune response. Overall, the benefits of vaccination to prevent COVID-19 infection likely outweigh the risks of any potential adverse effects, including GBS, as stated in recent guidelines from the centers for disease control and world health organization.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient's past medical history included Asthma (Occasionally, weather related, in the spring and the fall the patient would have asthma). Concurrent medical conditions included Sjogren's (autoimmune condition called Sjogren's) and Pulmonary hypertension. Concomitant products included LOSARTAN and AMLODIPINE for an unknown indication.   On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In February 2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath). In March 2021, the patient experienced HEART RATE INCREASED (fast pulse/ rapid pulse/ heart rate goes up). On 19-Jun-2021, the patient experienced HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heart rate). On 21-Jul-2021, the patient experienced CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (congestive heart failure) (seriousness criteria disability and medically significant). On 16-Sep-2021, the patient experienced SUSPECTED COVID-19 (CAT scan of my lungs on 16Sep2021, and it shows there was covid-19). At the time of the report, CARDIAC FAILURE CONGESTIVE (congestive heart failure), HEART RATE INCREASED (fast pulse/ rapid pulse/ heart rate goes up) and DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath) had not resolved and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (irregular heart rate) and SUSPECTED COVID-19 (CAT scan of my lungs on 16Sep2021, and it shows there was covid-19) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Heart rate: abnormal (abnormal) rapid pulse since March 2021. On 19-Jun-2021, Heart rate: irregular heart rate (abnormal) irregular heart rate. On 16-Sep-2021, Computerised tomogram: it shows there was covid-19 (abnormal) it shows there was covid-19. On 16-Sep-2021, Oxygen saturation: 96 to down 85 (Low) 96 to down 85. On an unknown date, Oxygen saturation: decreased (Low) Decreased.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No Treatment information was provided.  The patient had the second shot in February, and since then, she had trouble with shortness of breath. She had rapid pulse since March 2021. She did an echo with the heart doctor and nothing showed up. However, on 19Jun2021, she did an EKG, and this showed that I have an irregular heart rate. On 21Jul2021, she ended up with congestive heart failure. She just got the results from the CAT scan of her lungs on 16Sep2021, and it shows there was covid-19. She never tested for covid, she never had a fever. The only thing that could have done this was the vaccine. Now, she can't do anything. If she does something, her oxygen falls down. She had been with oxygen ever since she had the heart failure.  She still needs the oxygen. She had fatigue, and her oxygen goes down, and her heart rate goes up. On 16Sep2021 was the first time she had dinner. Oxygen went from  96 to down 85. In the end, she couldn't get the dinner done.  On unknown date the patient experienced fatigue and decreased activity.  Company Comment: This case concerns a 80-year-old female patient with a previous relevant medical history of Sjogren's disease, Asthma and Pulmonary hypertension, who experienced the unexpected events of Heart rate irregular and Cardiac failure congestive after Spikevax (mRNA- 1273 vaccine / Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine). Additionally, Suspected COVID-19 was also reported. The onset of the event Heart rate irregular occurred approximately 4 months and 29 days after the second dose of Spikevax and Cardiac failure congestive 6 months after the second dose. COVID-19 was suspected because of an abnormal computerised tomogram performed 7 months and 26 days after the second dose, but the diagnosis was not confirmed. The rechallenge was not applicable, as the events were reported exclusively after the second dose. Previous history of pulmonary hypertension remains a confounder. The benefit-risk relationship of Spikevax vaccine is not affected by    Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 17-Sep-2021: Follow up received on 17-SEP-2021 contained significant information, events were added, lab tests were added, historical condition and current conditions were added, onset date of events were added.; Sender's Comments: This case concerns a 80-year-old female patient with a previous relevant medical history of Sjogren's disease, Asthma and Pulmonary hypertension, who experienced the unexpected events of Heart rate irregular and Cardiac failure congestive after Spikevax (mRNA- 1273 vaccine / Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine).

On an unspecified date the patient experienced feet swelled and he was retaining fluid; everything was inflamed; he was not able to wiggle his toes much; calcium deposit; nerve ending pain in the left big toe area and inside the foot. On 13Sep2021, the patient hadn't been able to hardly walk in over a month/ crazy pain, when he tried to stand up this morning, it was so bad, he could barely walk. The clinical course was as follows: On 15Aug2021, he started having problems in the left knee. He went to bed and 30 minutes later, he sat straight up in bed, like it was a throbbing, toothache pain. He did not know what was going on. It started moving around the knee from the right side, inside the knee, to the bottom outside on the left, then the top of it. During the night, it just kept rotating around. He was told it was the muscles and it was going on with the back. On 17Aug2021, two days later (on ""Tuesday""), it started moving to the foot and since 13Sep2021, he hasn't been able to walk since the joint in his ankle, foot and toes hurt. He has had problems with gout, and they gave him indomethacin (INDOCIN) just in case and he started taking that. He could hardly walk; the pain was so bad. All he could do to get to the rest room. ""Friday"", his wife took him to the Emergency room, and they did not do X-rays or anything. They gave him some steroids (prednisone), the taper down pack. He took them and even as he was taking them, he was still getting no relief. They did give him something at the hospital, a little medication to take, a little steroid. The next day, he could walk a little bit. Since then, nothing else has worked. He called the family doctor and they changed it to colchicine. It got a little better but not great. After he was off the steroid colchicine, it started catching head on again. For the last week, he had been in pain. He went to the orthopedic doctor and they did an X-ray that showed that everything was inflamed. He had asked for a shot for the pain and they said the shot can cause inflammation or something (the orthopedic was scared he would tear his Achilles or set something loose). They gave him a topical cream; one was an over the counter one and the other was a compound that was made, and he has been on that. His doctor wanted him to go to physical therapy. He went to physical therapy on Friday. It was so swollen and tender, and he hasn't been able to wiggle his toes much. They put some electrodes on to try and stimulate some of it. It was where he was having most of the pain, which was really bad in the right ankle. They put some on his big toes and it was really giving him problems. In his right ankle was where he could really feel the electrodes and could feel his big toes. It was opposite on the left foot; he could feel it in the ankle and could not feel it in the toes. It was so weird. He had spent an hour and a half with them. He was not in the clear. The doctor did not even reschedule because he was not sure what to do. Since then, he developed it on the outside of the right foot. He just left the doctor's office again. He was at the family doctor, getting a bunch of blood work to see what he can get on after this. It won't be too many steroids because of all the side effects. The doctor did not know if it was a calcium deposit or what it was and was hoping for him to see the orthopedic doctor. He originally had an appointment not until 6 weeks, but now he was going this coming Wednesday to see if there was anything else they can do. If not, the family doctor wanted to send him to someone that handled that (someone you see for real severe pain and arthritis). His feet were swelled, and they were retaining fluid. It was in both feet and it all started the same time as everything else (unspecified date). The patient stated that sometimes it was not too bad. Last night he was feeling decent and this morning, he had been awake since 1:00 am with throbbing, nerve ending pain in the left big toe area and inside the foot. It was crazy pain. When he tried to stand up this morning, it was so bad, he could barely walk. It was in his ankles. He was walking around almost looking like a duck, shuffling his feet around. The caller stated ""I haven't been able to hardly walk in over a month."" The caller also reported he developed a flaky rash under his chin after receiving the vaccine. He stated ""we were at the lake and I thought how did I get sunburnt under my chin; I didn't think much about it much but it has not went away. I have been inside over a month because I can't get out. I put lotion and ointment on it and it's still there."" The rash started at the same time as everything else.

When she clearly noted that her mother was doing a few swooning side steps when getting up, she started to pay more attention to her blood pressure. Treatment: No, they stopped a particular med called Spironolactone which is also a diuretic and for blood pressure. They stopped that and then she had Furosemide, which she was not taking that regularly with the other meds but they told her to only use it if her weight changed like 3 pounds. It was given because of fluid retention. She has not had to take much of that, maybe one a day every 4 or 5 days. The Spironolactone was stopped.

He did mention that for the past 6 months, he was an avid runner, but because of the symptoms he experienced after he got COVID he felt like he had congestive heart failure. He also mentioned that he did not take in any medication yesterday after he got the shot. He was an avid runner and prior to onset of COVID he normally ran many miles no problem; but since having COVID in 2020 he has been struggling to get under an 8 minute mile. He basically just attributed that to his age with him getting older. But when he woke up this morning his wife asked him how he felt, expecting him not to feel well with the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine side effect profile; but when he woke up this morning he felt like a million dollars, felt like the vaccine had an instant effect on him. He was shocked because he no longer had sinus pressure, no longer had the dizziness experienced since having COVID, where when he first gets up in the morning its almost like a haze. This morning he noticed instantaneously the ability to breathe. Its shocking to him because he went for a sub 6 minute mile for first the time in almost a year today. It feels like a weight has been listed off of his chest. Prior to this he was getting a little worried about his own condition. He thinks he may have been a long-hauler with COVID symptoms lingering but it had become the norm for him. He knows this kind of positive effect seems rare, based on the lack of information he has found on it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on unspecified date.

1740209,09/28/2021,NY,49.0,,,M,,"Parsonage-Turner Syndrome Following COVID-19 Vaccination; This is a literature report, 2021, DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2021211374, entitled Parsonage-Turner Syndrome Following COVID-19 Vaccination: MR Neurography.  Vaccination is one of the several known triggers of Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS). This report describes 2 individuals with clinical presentations of PTS whose symptoms began 13 hours and 18 days following receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. The diagnosis of PTS was confirmed using both electrodiagnostic testing and 3 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) neurography. While research is needed to understand the association between PTS and COVID-19 vaccination, MR neurography may be used to confirm suspected cases of PTS as COVID-19 vaccines continue to be distributed worldwide. Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS; neuralgic amyotrophy) is a rare peripheral neuropathy typically characterized by sudden onset, severe upper arm pain followed by muscle weakness. Muscle weakness can be debilitating and up to two-thirds of patients experience long-term functional deficits. Materials and Methods: Two patients were referred for MR neurography between February and March 2021 due to clinically suspected PTS that developed 13 hours following the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine and 18 days following the Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccine. With informed consent from each participant, medical records were retrospectively reviewed for pertinent clinical and electrodiagnostic testing data as part of an ongoing, institutional review board- approved PTS registry compliant with the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act. A single musculoskeletal radiologist with greater than 7 years of MR neurography experience (DBS) reviewed 3-Tesla MR neurography and cervical spine MRI examinations. Results: Patient 1: A 49-year-old man was awoken by severe, electric shooting pain in his left volar forearm, 13 hours after receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in his contralateral, right shoulder. Due to persistent, severe pain, he went to the emergency room where he received intravenous, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but these provided only mild relief. Laboratory tests performed in the emergency room, including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panels were all normal. His past medical history was significant for Lyme disease manifesting with an erythema migrains lessions, fatigue and myalgias 2 months prior and treated with doxycycline, although Lyme IgM and IgG antibodies also obtained in the emergency room were negative, The patient was discharged and treated with an oral, 8-days prednisone taper, at the end of which his pain subsided. Electrodiagnostic testing performed 9 days post onset was normal; specifically, no median nerve abnormality was identified on the nerve conduction or electromyography portions of the exam. The patient developed weakness in wrist flexion and forearm pronation the day after electromyography, along with numbness along a 1-inch strip in the middle, volar forearm region. Cervical spine and brachial plexus MRI performed 9 days post onset of initial pain symptoms did not demonstrate any findings to account for the patient's symptoms. Eight weeks post onset of initial pain, physical examination by a neurologist revealed mild atrophy in the left volar forearm and mild weakness in forearm pronation and wrist flexion (British Medical Research Council Scale strength 4+/5). MR neurography demonstrated prominent denervation edema pattern of the pronator teres (PT) and flexor carpi radials (FCR) muscles within the forearm. Within the arm, 4 severe hourglass-like constrictions and T2-weighted signal hyperintensity of the anteromedially positioned fascicular bundle of the median nerv0. Repeat e were detected; this bundle represents the PT/FCR bundle based on the known topographical, fascicular arrangement of the median nerve. Repeat electromyography, consistent with imaging findings, demonstrated severe denervation and no motor unit recruitment within the PT or FCR muscles. Muscles in the anterior interosseous nerve distribution were normal on MRI and electromyography. At 3 months' follow up post onset, the patient reported no residual pain but increased weakness. He had not yet received the second dose of his COVID-19 vaccine. Post-vaccination PTS typically ensure within 28 days of immunisation and has been reported as early as the same day as vaccination. Intrinsic, hourglass-like constrictions of affected nerves or nerve fascicles have been recognized in the acute phase of PTS10 and to date, they have not been observed in other spontaneous neuropathies. Patients 1 and 2 developed symptoms 13 hours and 18 days respectively, after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, with MR neurography confirming the diagnosis by 8 and 5 weeks, respectively. While approximately half of all individuals with PTS report no identifiable trigger,1 the close temporal association between events suggests that vaccination may have been linked to PTS in these patients. Patient 1 received a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease 2 months prior to PTS symptom onset despite negative OgM and IgG serologic tests, which have low sensitivity during early infection. He was treated with doxycycline and recovered prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In the report, 3 COVID-19 vaccines have received FDA Emergency Use Authorization. These include mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA1273), as well as a one-dose, replication-incompetent human adenovirus vector vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S). Additionally, some individuals will develop PTS within the post-vaccination window by chance alone. MR neurography is a useful diagnostic tool for PTS and may be particularly relevant as worldwide COVID-19 vaccinations increase. While there are currently no approved treatments, early, oral prednisone may reduce PTS symptom duration and severity. In recalcitrant cases, surgical neurolysis has also demonstrated efficacy. The timely and accurate diagnosis of PTS, which is often delayed, can help alleviate any undue stress for the patient and direct appropriate management. Patient 1.

Refer to HCP for evaluation and treatment of any adverse effects. In a Phase I/II study of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in adults, different strength doses of COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 were given. This means that some people in the trials have already received higher doses of a similar vaccine (BNT162b1) than the currently recommended dose. The trial showed that although a stronger dose (100 micrograms) was not harmful, the recipients experienced more local reactions with very painful arms being reported. Participants who received 58 micrograms of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine [the product currently marketed as Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine] in clinical trials did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse events. If a person is given more than the recommended dose, they should be monitored and treated for any symptoms as required. They should be reassured that this is not harmful but that they may be more likely to experience pain in their injected arm. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

A 67-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 23Feb2021 (at the age of 67-years-old female) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation (COVID-19 vaccination). Medical history included lupus (this was diagnosed 7 years ago), multiple sclerosis (this was diagnosed 15 years ago). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications, no other products. Reportedly, the patient had her first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 23Feb2021, 5 days later she had a mammogram, and then 8 days later (on the 13th day after her vaccine) started to experience swollen, painful lymph nodes on her left side upper neck, jaw, and armpit (injection side was left arm) in Mar2021. Her mammogram readings were affected by her swollen lymph nodes that were potentially from the vaccine. Clinical course was as follow: The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to provide information about a problem she had which was a mammo effect reaction (documented as reported). She said she had her first dose of the vaccine then went for her mammogram on 01Mar2021 which was approximately 5 days after she had the vaccine and she had gotten information from the doctor's office afterwards. She received a letter from mammogram doctor saying that she needed to schedule a second mammogram and an ultrasound, and that the situation was they needed to redo the mammograms due to abnormalities. She heard from someone, but not her doctors, that there had been information in circulation about vaccine affecting mammograms. She has been trying to get ahold of her gynecologist to confirm that, since when she got the mammogram no one knew about it, she went in under the wire. She said she had got a flare up that started on the 13th day after her vaccine with her lymph nodes that was very severe and has gone on for 5 days. She didn't know if having a mammogram increased that or not, but she wanted to report it. In Mar2021, she had very severe lymph node swelling, and her breasts were swollen as well. She says she didn't know; part of her lymph nodes was very painful. She was due for her second mammogram which was scheduled. Her lymph nodes in her underarms, up her neck and jaw, and her breasts were so inflamed, they were double in size and extremely painful in Mar2021. She said since she has had a very severe reaction to the first dose, and she had not been able to get ahold of her doctor and her lymph node has really flared, she had a question about mammogram and second vaccine shot 4 days after a mammogram (second vaccine was due 4 days after she followed up for mammogram). She was concerned about that, having a second mammogram and then a second vaccine shot. She said she knew that the second dose was more prone to people having a reaction normally, so she was wondering if having a mammogram first then the second shot would start another lymph node reaction with it being done in the reverse order for the shot and mammogram. Her second dose was scheduled on the 30th day since she couldn't get another appointment. The patient said that she didn't think that this was a normal reaction, and she was told it was not normal, but the doctors there were not up to speed with that situation. She said she also had MS and Lupus, so she was not a normal patient as well. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included mammogram: unknown result on 01Mar2021, urine analysis: normal on unspecified date (Verbatim: had a urinalysis that was routine which was fine and normal). For adverse event treatment of all, she was taking store brand acetaminophen, she took it two or three times since she can't take NSAIDs, and she also applied ice. She was taking two tablets each time of the over-the-counter strength acetaminophen, which was 325mg. She said she hasn't done anything else because she wanted her doctor to give her instructions. She has contacted her MD but had not received a follow up call for further guidance from them. Outcome for all events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

She reported that there was a lack of information provided and that when she reached the vaccine facility, it was all very disorganized inside.

She stated that she doesn't know if the vaccine hits the weak spot. Reporter also stated that she had attributed the back pain to the constipation she was experiencing as she couldn't go the first few days, that having all the stool backed up could cause back pain but reported that after she finally had a bowel movement the back pain wasn't lightening up at all. She reported that after taking Metamucil and eating a lot of fiber and cabbage, it has not been able to diminish the pain much. It wears on her since the pain has been there day after day. Reporter reported that she waited awhile to follow up regarding her symptoms because it didn't dawn on her that it could be from the Covid-19 vaccine, but now she's convinced that it is the cause. Reporter stated that she was asked her ethnicity when she registered to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. She stated that she doesn't understand, it's (the covid virus) killing population, it's just awful. She stated that she didn't have covid to begin with, but now with Pfizer if she's getting crippled, she would have taken her chances without getting the vaccine. Reporter reported that she is frightened, very frightened. She stated that it's difficult when there's no improvement, when day after day she's in the same degree of discomfort and pain, that it's wearing on her.

She is a healthy adult; she is strong and active. She is 70 years old. She got the vaccine 04 Mar and what happened to her was 6 days later which she knows is long for an adverse reaction, but she went to bed the night of the 6th day, all day that day she was fine, it was a normal day, she had no reaction to the vaccine up until that point other than just some tenderness where the injection was made but that's it. She went to bed that Wednesday night, it was 6 days after 04Mar, she woke up around 3 AM to go to the bathroom and she realized she was clammy, she had fever and chills on 11Mar2021, but the disturbing part was that she tried to stand up and got incredibly dizzy. She had to hold on to furniture to get the bathroom without falling.

She could not grab things or coordinate anything, she finally got water and took the Aspirin and went to bed and she was so relieved to be back in bed. She woke up Thursday morning so that morning had been 1 full week since the vaccine. She felt perfectly fine that Thursday morning, it was like nothing had happened at all. She does not know if what happened was related to the vaccine but it was so far out of the norm for her so she would like to know if other people might have had this experience so far. She would prefer not to use the email. She has gotten a lot of strange email from some of the opportunities that she signed up for to increase her chance to get an appointment. She does not think she wants to provide that information. Her doctor retired and she got a new doctor before COVID struck and she has only met with her briefly, they haven't had a full visit. She is not sure of the zip code. It is not her usual clinic, she had to drive quite a ways away to get it.

Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took tylenol. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced that I had a fever and am achy (which I dont care about it). My normal temperature was usually 97.8 but I have a low grade fever and did not come until about 1 hour or so. I got the vaccine at around 12:15 and asked that can you take aspirin and Tylenol. I got my vaccine last Wednesday and had a couple little weird things which was not unusual for me. I had already called Pfizer because I had a fever and I wanted to make sure I can take Tylenol. On 18Mar2021, a day after that my index finger was swollen and had a knot. The next day it moved to the next finger and had a knot between the knuckle and palm knuckle. On Friday I ended up with a very strange thing under my arm where I got my shot. It was burning and swollen between my elbow and arm pit on the side I got my shot but no redness. It felt like someone was holding a match under my arm, on her right hand in her index finger the knuckle between her palm and the first knuckle swelled and she got a little tiny knot that felt like a marble. Caller states she got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on Wednesday and then last Friday 19Mar2021, she was going to call and thought surely this was a fluke and then thought it may just be due to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated she was a retired librarian and retired due to COVID and she knows research was important. Caller stated that on her right hand in her index finger the knuckle between her palm and the first knuckle swelled and she got a little tiny knot that felt like a marble which happened the day after the vaccine on Thursday. She stated that she woke up on Friday and the knot had kind of gone out of her index finger and she had no idea why that would be and thought dear God why this was happening and then this moved to her middle finger the next day on 19Mar2021 which was the day after her index finger started swelling. Caller states the flesh between her palm and 1st knuckle had swelling and it was not ongoing but by the next day she would say not all the swelling had gone but she would say 85-90 percent of the swelling was gone; states her index finger was back to pretty much normal and the swelling was coming down. She was sick for three years and knows what swelling was and this swelling she had in her finger was not huge but was strange but the next morning that finger was still a little bit swollen and then moved to her middle finger swelling and it had not gone down on the index finger but the swelling was definitely down and no longer had the little marblely thing; states there was a marblely thing in her middle finger and that was the right hand and the middle finger was swollen. She always seems to have bizarre things and slept 12 hours on Tylenol 3 and does not take codeine and that was her history; caller states she had no lot numbers, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide for the Tylenol 3 and states she did not taking it for the COVID Vaccine but it was decades ago and the Tylenol 3 had nothing to do with this and it seems to be something odd and stated that if she had to have surgery they wake her up yelling her name and nothing goes quite smooth for her medically; states she was just mentioning the Tylenol 3 because it always seems to be an odd thing and had nothing literally to do with this. In October she was going for a routine checkup and 6 days later had surgery for a breast check and states she knows she was getting older; no further details provided by the caller. On Sunday after getting the Pfizer COVID shot, in her left arm between her elbow and her armpit on the underside all of a sudden on the same arm as her vaccine, right between basically her elbow and her armpit, it swelled up a little bit and felt like she was hovering over a match and it was burning but not red, she was concerned with the burning between her elbow and armpit on the underside of her Pfizer COVID shot area.

The patient was hospitalized from 05-May-2021 to 09-May-2021 due to MYOCARDITIS. The patient was treated with COLCHICINE on 06-May-2021 for Chest pain, at an unspecified dose and frequency. On 06-Jun-2021, MYOCARDITIS (Acute myocarditis) had resolved. At the time of the report, MALAISE (Malaise), COUGH (Dry cough), MYALGIA (Myalgias) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 05-May-2021, Angiocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) showed very mild coronary artery disease. On 05-May-2021, C-reactive protein: 63.5 mg/l (High) 63.5 mg/L (reference range: =8.0?mg/L). On 05-May-2021, Cardiac ventriculogram left: 40% (abnormal) showed a mildly reduced ejection fraction of 40% with global hypokinesis that was most severe at the apex. On 05-May-2021, Echocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) Showed a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.Demonstrated borderline enlarged left ventricle with an estimated ejection fraction of 40�45%, mild-moderate generalized left ventricular hypokinesis, slightly worse at the apex, borderline enlarged right ventricle with mildly-moderately decreased systolic function, and no significant valve disease.. On 05-May-2021, Electrocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the lateral limb and precordial leads. On 05-May-2021, Eosinophil count (0.03-0.48): 0.04 � 10(9)/l (normal) 0.04 � 10(9)/L. On 05-May-2021, Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: 29?mmhg (High) markedly elevated at 29?mmHg. On 05-May-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging heart: acute myocarditis (abnormal) was compatible with acute myocarditis with patchy linear mid-myocardial enhancement of the septum and inferior walls at the base to mid-ventricle, sub-epicardial/mid-myocardial enhancement of the lateral wall at the mid-ventricle and apical lateral wall. There was associated myocardial oedema involving most of the myocardium and mild pericardial enhancement. On 05-May-2021, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide: 1059 pg/ml (High) 1059 pg/mL (reference range: =51?pg/mL). On 05-May-2021, Physical examination: minimal lower extremity swelling (abnormal) showed minimal lower extremity swelling. On 05-May-2021, Red blood cell sedimentation rate (2-2): 12 mm/h (High) 12 mm/h. On 05-May-2021, Troponin T: 847 ng/l (High) 847 ng/L (reference range: =15?ng/L). On 05-May-2021, Vital signs measurement: normal (normal) temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/72, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. On 05-May-2021, White blood cell count (3.4-9.6): 9.7 � 10(9)/l (High) 9.7 � 10(9)/L. On 06-May-2021, Echocardiogram: normal (normal) Repeat Transthoracic echocardiogram showing normalization of ejection fraction, and no regional wall motion abnormalities. On 06-May-2021, Troponin T: 675?ng/l (High) decreased to 675?ng/L the day after admission. On an unknown date, Chest X-ray: mild pulmonary oedema (abnormal) showed findings consistent with mild pulmonary oedema. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative (COVID-19 nasal swab testing using polymerase chain reaction was negative).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter considered MYOCARDITIS (Acute myocarditis), MALAISE (Malaise), COUGH (Dry cough), MYALGIA (Myalgias) and HEADACHE (Headache) to be possibly related.    Patient was in his usual state of health prior to getting the second dose of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. There was no family history of cardiovascular or autoimmune disease.  Endomyocardial biopsy was not performed as the patient experienced mild symptoms, had no haemodynamic or electrical instability, and responded promptly to initial management.  The patient was started on supportive therapy for the symptoms, including a brief course of intravenous diuretics for mild symptoms of congestion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker therapy were commenced to treat systolic dysfunction. The patient was also initiated on colchicine to treat mild persistent chest pain, which was thought to be related to pericardial inflammation that resolved 4-5?days after presentation.   The patient was discharged home after 5 days of monitoring without evidence of electrical or haemodynamic instability and with Class I symptoms. One month later, repeat echocardiogram showed normalization of the left ventricular ejection fraction (56%) and size, no regional wall motion abnormalities, and normal longitudinal peak systolic strain. The patient remained asymptomatic and off diuretics.  This case concerns a 44-year-old male patient with a history of Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, Asthma and Obesity, who experienced the serious expected event Myocarditis. The event occurred approximately 4 days after the second and most recent dose of mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine. The event was considered related to the study drug per the reporter's assessment. The event is consistent with the current understanding of the mechanism of action of the study medication. The benefit-risk relationship of mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine is not affected by this report.

Here is a summary of my symptoms following the first dose: ~3 hrs after the vaccine, I had numbness and tingling on left side of my face, including the left side of my tongue (followed by 1st trip to ER). The next day, I had unilateral numbness on the entire left side of my body from the top of my head to the bottom of my foot (followed by 2nd trip to ER that included a CT scan and MRI). The numbness lasted about 3 days, turned to tingling (similar to when your leg ?falls asleep? and starts to ?wake up?), and then pain before the symptoms mostly subsided. A few hours later (this is now 4/20), I had a migraine (I get headaches often, but this was the 3rd migraine that I?ve had in my life ? ibuprofen/Tylenol rotation did not help and only when I was able to finally sleep was there some relief). Following the migraine, the unilateral numbness returned (4/21). A neurologist started me on a 5-day Prednisone treatment; symptoms mostly subsided, but the unilateral numbness returned on the 3rd day of the treatment (4/23). Over the first two weeks following the shot, I logged my daily symptoms as they occurred. In addition to the numbness and the migraine, my log included at various times: other headaches, pressure behind eyes, pressure in one ear, pounding heart (yet normal heart rate), pain in left chest, cramps (legs, feet, side ? noted well hydration), short/sharp pain in side, forgetfulness, body aches, pressure in chest with deep breaths, tired, etc. Weeks 3-4 after the shot, I noted a rash on left leg.   Yesterday, I received my second shot. The symptoms seem to be coming on a quicker timeline. ~75 min after the shot numbess in left face (I was sure to get the shot on the right arm this time, first shot was in  the left arm with left side numbness...this one right arm shot , but still left side numbness). Quickly spread to numbness on full left side of the body. The numbness was present when I woke up this morning and turned to tingling (similar to when your leg ?falls asleep? and starts to ?wake up?) and now pain. I've also noted on my log: forgetfulness (my wife called me loopy), pressure behind left eye, pressure in left ear, pain in right chest (where my heart would be but other side - rather brief)... if I'm on the same path as the first shot with just a faster timeline, the migraine is up next. Plus I've had a few blood tests: 1 was ordered by the neurologist (4/20/21 - no concerns on his end he only noted slightly elevated vitamin D) and another blood test order by primary dr near end of July 2021 to check if i had indicators for Gilbert's syndrome (which my dad has but my blood test results and past blood test results indicate that I don't have it).",,,,,,,,,N,09/27/2021,09/27/2021,0,,UNK,,"Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, zyrtec",NA,NA,Pfizer covid vaccine 1st dose on 4/17/21,,2,09/28/2021,,Y,Y,"Yellow Jackets, Gluten (intolerance)"

The next day I woke up in cold sweats. I still had the ongoing fatigue, ears were hurting, sore throat, body aches. This lasted for 2 days. Friday was the first day I woke up without cold sweats. Currently, my ears feel very tender/sensitive. It feels as if my ear was scraped out and left raw. My throat feels similar to when I got my tonsils out. The biggest thing I have is anxiety. The intensity will vary but the sensation is still there. I feel butterflies in my throat. Like a fight or flight sensation takes over. My mind is not anxious, but my body is. For example, if I am driving and come across a red light, I get overwhelmed which is very unusual for me. I am not an anxious person. Getting gowned up for work was not something that would ever make me anxious, and it does now. I was prescribed Vistaril which is not doing anything. My blood pressure was 132/84 also which is high for me. I thought it might play a role in the anxious feeling. I was told to take Prilosec because the butterflies feeling in my throat could've been reflux due to the location of the sensation but that is not working. I also still have ongoing fatigue, I am always tired and have no energy. Fatigue and anxiety are the most prominent and concerning symptoms.

At which time, September 11th 2021, an MRI was done which showed a mass near the lacrimal sac. Biopsy results showed necrotic Granulomas with numerous acid fast bacilli consistent with a mycobacterial infection. Currently speciation and sensitivities are unknown. Modified RIPE therapy had been implemented with the concern that IV antibiotics may also need to be used depending on PCR and culture results.  I have yet to recover from this infection and have been out of work since 8/13. I have lost weight, suffer from right sided headaches, right eye pain, slightly blurred vision on the right side, and will have a facial deformity due to the I&D and surgery. I also suffer from fatigue and general malaise.  I will still require at least one more surgery to reconstruct the lacrimal duct system.  While I understand that one could argue that I am immunocompromised due to the medications I?m on for Crohn?s disease, I would argue that I do not have a history of infections, risky personal habits or travel.

The vaccine as injected into my left arm intermuscular into my deltoid muscle. The next day I had constant metal taste in my mouth, and which has not changed to this day along with weakness. A few days later I started having palpitations and feeling very light headed and short of breath. Along with severe headaches this issue has continued to increase. On September 9th 2021 while at work, I attempted to get up from my chair and felt extremely dizzy and started to fall at that point a co-worker grabbed me and helped me back into my chair and proceeded to get my blood pressure which was very elevated for my baseline. My coworkers at that point called one of the nurses that I work with to come and evaluate me and my blood pressure remained elevated then one of the doctors that I work with came in to do an assessment on me she listened to my heart and my lungs, at that time she advised for me to have an EKG.    Once all of my symptoms continued to worsen, I called my doctor to have an appointment due to all the health issues that I have experience since the vaccine. They took my vitals and preformed an EKG which showed to be abnormal. I have been referred to cardiology now due to the health complications since the vaccine. The following day while at work the symptoms were increasing with my blood pressure and tachycardia, When I returned from my lunch break, I felt very weak and lightheaded. When I reach my floor to my department my nurse manager was there and saw that I was not feeling well. She then took my blood pressure and it was so elevated that they called a code blue on me. I was transported via ambulance to Hospital and they performed 2 EKGs on me there. After being in the back of the ER they moved me to the lobby due to all the exam room being torn up from the new construction that they are doing. My husband who met me there at the emergency room where we waited for three hours from no rooms from the construction being done, took me to another ER where I was taken back within minutes. Once back in the exam room the nurses and doctors evaluated me and took another EKG and I had several labs done and x-rays and ultrasounds. After all the testes were done, The ER doctors came in and advised me of the abnormal EKG and all the other test results. They advised me to see a cardiologist as soon as possible. I followed with my primary care provider and again my vitals were elevated for me. He went over my labs and results from the ER who took excellent care of me. Every day I have weakness and brain fog and tachycardia and shortness of breath. Where-as prior to the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine I have been a healthy person for all of my life. Always exercising and walking, climbing stairs and being a mother that has children and a wife that has taken care of my family I want and need to stay active and healthy for them. Now am limited to the ?normal? activities that I can do without getting short of breath and my heart racing. Now I have worry that if I get up to quick and walk a faster pace that I will pass out.

I had scars on my thigh from the hives. I checked my mouth and my gum started to crack open. I went back to the ER. They said it was still and allergic reaction.

1741508,09/28/2021,AZ,60.0,60,,F,,"At the time of the vaccination, no adverse affects. I got the first dose in my left arm (due to being at a drive-thru site). Barely any soreness at all (discomfort 1/10). I sleep on that side, so I asked for dose #2 in my right arm. It was exactly three weeks later. No side effects, no fever, no nausea, hardly felt it at the injection site. Not much discomfort (scale 3/10 in my arm).  After almost 2-3 weeks, started to see a rash, which got more extensive and was later diagnosed via biopsy as being: Granuloma annulare. The rash started on my upper arms, near the vaccine site and has spread quite a bit.  SEE CONTINUATION PAGE for a full history of this issue and what has been tried to date..... The rash started on my upper arms, near the vaccine site and now covers both arms, is also on both legs, my chest and neck.   __The rash started about 2-3 weeks after my second dose of Pfizer. I thought it was stress, as I was retiring on 5/8, in just another 2 weeks.... This assumption that it was stress caused me to delay seeing my doctor (my mother used to break out in hives from stress, regularly). At that time, it was mostly on my upper arms - heavily on the outer side and some spots on the inner side, and starting on the backs of my calves with a few spots on the front of my thighs. __I finally saw my doctor on 5/17 when I was clear that it needed to be seen. Doctor thought it was a histamine reaction to something. But I had not changed ANYTHING in my diet, no new/different soaps, no new clothes, no new sheets, we could not identify anything different that could have caused an allergic reaction. Doctor started me on OTC at first: benadryl cream and claritin 1x/day, with instructions to come back in two weeks. This regimen did not help and the rash got worse. __Second office visit with Doctor  on 6/3:  we tried a different regimen, adding a prescription ointment: Triamcinolone Acetonide Topical, and  upping the OTC antihistamines. Claritin in AM and Zyrtec in PM. (since they had different ingredients). Still didn't clear it up at all. Instead, it was spreading down my arms and more on my legs. __Office visit #3 to Doctor  on 6/14: Since treating it like a histamine reaction was not having any effect, he took a biopsy so we could definitely know what it was. Got the results 6/22. Doctor  prescribed a steroid cream, with instructions 2 weeks on/2 weeks off. I used this for two weeks, results were not great..... I then found a medical dermatologist who was familiar with my diagnosis.  __7/13: Met with Physician Assistant at Dermatologist.  He was very familiar with Granuloma annulare. We went with a cream and a steroid pill:  Prednisone - 20 mg/day for 10 days then reduce to 10 mg/day for 10 days. And Pimecrolimus Cream 1% (generic for Elidel Cream 1%). Instructed to apply cream 2x/day. Ran out pretty quickly, as the rash was extensive on my arms and legs.  __8/3: Visit #2 with Physician Assistant. Rash seemed better. Was less red and smoother to the touch. Renewed prescription for Prednisone (waited until 8/16 to take the next round, due to a trip and wanting to put some time between steroid treatments).  Used the cream at least once daily, sometimes twice. Found it difficult to plan when to apply it, due to wanting to avoid being ""slimy"" around other people or sitting on furniture or handling my contact lenses.  __My own assessment is that the Prednisone does not make a big difference for the rash. But the cream does - though only if I apply it heavily and frequently. If I miss a few applications, then the rash gets visibly worse, and quickly. The rash is now also on my upper chest and I can feel the bumpiness on sides and back of my neck. It is much worse on my lower arms - both outside and inside, as well as the inside of my upper arms. It has also spread on my legs. The back of my calves are much worse, it is now behind my knees and starting up the back of my thigh. And on the front of the thighs it has spread upwards and to the inside. Also, on my left foot, there was one small spot in the middle of my arch (on the top of the foot).

It is very similar to Guiliann Barrett but this is a chronic and incurable version of Gillian Barrett. She Regulatory Authority - it is an Acronym - Multi-focal neuropathy. I have begun IVIG - IV immuno-globulin therapy - I have had  10 of those treatments. Typically after two or three treatments of this you get dramatically better from CIDP but I have neuropathy in the feet and I have to walk with a cane now. I""m literally getting worse every day. And I'm having PT and OT therapy and am scheduled for a speech evaluation. I can't use my right dominant hand - t he first three fingers at all. OT eval was yesterday - 30 day evaluation  - and I have dramatically lost significant strength between thumb and index fingers which are the only two fingers in my right hand that have use but I have a 10th of a grip that I have on my left side (which is non dominant side). I can't stand unassisted for 10 minutes. I have speech things (issues) come in when I start getting tired - inflammatory process in the brain and it's called Bulbar Neuropathy - Cerebral nerve 9-12 - get pinched off signals. The neurologist said she's seen 4 or 5 cases who have had things that flare up after the second COVID shot. Like people have had things that are slow simmering - there seems to be a correlation to those people who have had a flare after the second shot. And the treatment now is going to include some IV or Oral steroids - but it's not certain which. Then there are some chemicals and maybe chemotherapy which work with this to suppress the immune system. The numbness is starting to come in the left pinkie as well of my left hand. I have that  pinkie, ring finger and my middle finger splinted because I have cannot move them on my own. I can still make the pinkie finger move although slowly.  I can't use my dominant hand anymore and I can't walk unassisted and it is likely permanent.",,,,,,,,Y,N,03/27/2021,03/28/2021,1,"Neurologist - has ordered all the tests and bloodwork.

1742522,09/28/2021,KY,37.0,37,,F,,"About five minutes after getting my shot my arm felt cold my fingertips kind of Tangled stuff that I was expecting. And then my lips started tingling, they didn't plump up like they do when I eat something I'm allergic to. They did get a little chubby but I have no idea how much I was wearing my mask and I didn't necessarily have a mirror. That and I didn't feel like they got super big. I realize they must have got a little bigger than I thought the next day because when I could feel them it kind of felt like it I don't know really how to describe that unless you've had an allergic reaction you don't know what I'm talkin about or if you ever got your swollen before. But my face ended up going numb that was more concerning. I was offered a Benadryl and a water. I did not accept I was told I didn't need to go to the doctors or I needed to go to the doctors only if I was having trouble breathing or rash appeared. None of that stuff happened. I waited for an hour I wasn't really checked on I have people stopped and talked to me but it wasn't so much to check on me it was curiosity as to what happened because they were standing around when I told him that I was having a bad reaction. I also had a get some kind of cold sweat when I first talked to him but that went away rather quickly. My vision did go wonky a couple of times but as I sat there it kind of chilled out. That was basically it I was advised by somebody else at the Pharmacy I don't know who they are to contact my doctor the next day if I did not go in. Today my face has been partially numb and spots on and off and at times very itchy. Since I'm used to allergies and I have an EpiPen available I did not need to go into the hospital which was already overcrowded. If my face stayed numb and wasn't getting better I had planned to go in. I have had weird effects like what I have mentioned on and off today my lips feel weird sometimes my face feels itchy and sometimes numb in spots. This is not normal for me in any way shape or form. As for everything else there's no hives there's no anything at the injection site there's no bruising it's a little warm and feels like it's bruised but not a bad bruise. I did talk to my doctor they do not advise me to get the second dose. They also advised me to talk to an allergist to write a medical exemption form as they are concerned with what could happen the next time I get to shot considering the Doctors told me that the second shot could have worst side effects. I was told this before the shot. As the packet he gave me was all about moderna I was told who I talk to and that is not normally what they're back sheet looks like it was a couple pages but everything was about moderna and I was under the impression that I was going to be contacted the day that I was in there however when I asked him if we could go ahead you the paperwork so I could leave he handed me the packet I just mentioned opened up to the page where I should contact you and told me all the information I needed was in that packet and then proceeded off to go do something behind the Pharmacy Counter. I didn't look at the paperwork until today because I wasn't feeling well. Also he reassured me that I got the Pfizer shot because that's the only saw that they carry at that particular . He also said he was going to check out next time they printed out the papers to make sure that it was printing out the packet how it was supposed to. I would also like to note that I was not really asked what was wrong with me I had to volunteer that information myself they didn't really seem to care what my symptoms were. It felt like I was in a less they know conversation. Had I had felt better or I was thinking straight I probably would have gone into the hospital. To me I was just trying to stay calm and I think I made myself feel less panicked then I should have been. I was trying not to cry or freak out as there were other patients and I knew I had to make sure my kids were picked up first. But even after they were picked up I still felt scared. It's like they did not care I felt like a side show where everybody was like what's happening and then once they knew they didn't care they just walked off. I tried to keep my mind off it I talked to a couple people in there try to keep my nerves level. I know this last part of the helpful but I just think the whole thing was handled not so well. I'm not a hysterical person but that's how I felt inside.

This was strange because I have never had something like this before, and I have not played sports or had any real opportunity to hurt my leg physically, nor have I engaged in any activity that could have physically impacted the area. I noticed this a few days after the shot, but I suspect it started earlier and I had not noticed until a few days later when it hurt. I have monitored the site and it reached its peak about one week after the vaccine and then stayed that way for a few days, then gradually subsided. I still have the lump, but it is much reduced and does not hurt any more. I hesitated to take the second dose appointment worried that it could be related to the vaccine dose, and if it is, I am worried if this kind of swelling (or maybe it is an internal clot) or whatever it was, could turn up in  a more vital area of my body, such as my brain, where it could be dangerous.",,,,,,,,,U,08/27/2021,09/01/2021,5,"I asked the pharmacy where I took the shot and they said I should have it checked out at the ER!

The same night, my calves were extremely sore and my left calf continued to be sore for days after getting the shot. Along with being sore, I felt this pulsating feeling in my calf that was constant throughout the day. This went on for about 10 days until the pulsating feeling traveled to my left thigh. It was very clear that the pulsating feeling was actually my muscle twitching. I could see my thigh muscle twitching very clearly through my skin. This twitching occurred all day, every day until the time of my 2nd shot. Three days after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine which I received on September 1st, 2021, the muscle twitching began again but in every muscle in my body this time. The twitching is sporadic and occurs in different muscle groups including my thighs, calves, buttocks, intercostal muscles, back, shoulders, forearm, triceps, chest, hamstrings, eyes, tongue and lips. The muscle twitching occurs at rest, while standing and while sitting. Some days the twitching is more intense and I can see I through my skin, other days they are less intense where I can feel them, however, they are not visible through my skin. There has not been a day where I have not experienced these fasiculations since receiving my first dose of the moderna vaccination.  It has been almost a total of two months of experiencing muscle twitching. I have seen my primary doctor, a neurologist and been to an Emergency room. I believe it is possible that the vaccine triggered a central nervous system response that is causing neuron excitability. My primary care doctor prescribed Diazepam 5mg to aid with the twitches, primarily at night so I am able to sleep, however, I can still feel the twitches mildly even after taking the medication. Certain locations such as my left thigh, and right upper back  seem to be popular locations for the muscle twitches. The twitches often occur the longest and the most often in those muscles.

1743405,09/29/2021,WI,,,,U,,"This literature marketed report has been received from the authors of a published literature article, titled as stated above, containing retrospectively measured using 2 matched cohorts and refers to 39 patients of unknown gender with median age 74.3 (61.3-95.6) years without a history of immunosuppression who were seen by their primary care provider at some point in the years 2000 through 2015. There was no information about the patients' concurrent conditions, concomitant therapies, drug reactions, allergies or medical history provided. The patients did not have history of HIV/AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and did not have history of any prescription of the immunomodulating druganti-IL6, B-cell blockade, calcineurin inhibitors, costimulation blockade, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, interleukin-1 inhibitors, interleukin-17 inhibitors, monoclonal TNF-alpha antibody, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, chemotherapy, and 2 or more prescriptions of glucocorticoids within the past year.  On unknown dates, the patients were vaccinated with live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) (formulation, strength, dose, route of administration, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis.  On unknown dates, the patients developed giant cell arteritis (GCA). 16 patients (41%) were diagnosed via positive biopsy and 23 (59%) were diagnosed by nonpathological College of Rheumatology clinical criteria. The median time from live attenuated herpes zoster (ZVL) vaccination to a diagnosis of GCA was a median (range) of 37.7 (4.9�104.3) months, with peaks around 15 months and 45 months The outcome of the event was unknown.  According to authors, matched comparison of ZVL vs non-ZVL patients showed that vaccinated patients had a significantly higher incidence of GCA. This association may potentially be attributed to (1) subacute or persistent arterial wall infection with ZVL, (2) a ZVL vaccine-driven cellular immune response to VZV already present in the arterial walls, or (3) a non-viralspecific autoimmune reaction triggered by ZVL. Using proportional hazards regression models of time to GCA by combination of both diagnostic case criteria, ZVL vaccination was associated with an increased risk of GCA diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% CI, 1.50�3.24; P < .0001). In the more specific, biopsy-confirmed subset of GCA cases, ZVL receipt remained a significant risk factor for GCA (HR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.48�4.95; P = .004). The authors performed a secondary analysis incorporating only those patients from the original matched cohort whose follow-up period included the year 2008 (the first year of widespread ZVL availability and use) or any subsequent years. In this subset (n = 62 395 patients with 130 GCA diagnoses), ZVL vaccination remained a significant risk factor for GCA diagnosis via all diagnostic criteria (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.58�3.47; P < .0001) and for GCA diagnosis by positive biopsy alone (57 GCA diagnoses; HR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.57�5.38; P = .0007).
