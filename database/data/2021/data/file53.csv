A 69-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6201), intramuscularly in left arm on 23Feb2021 (at the age of 69-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also took ginseng, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to 04Mar2021 at one pill, twice a day for an unspecified indication. Medical history included hepatitis A from 1975, moderate drinking and liver ache. Concomitant medications included L-arginine taken to ""keep the veins permeable""; aspartate zinc, magnesium aspartate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (ZMA) taken to help after exercise, help rebuild muscle tissue, keep up the blood flow; and lepidium meyenii (MACA). The patient reported he was slightly dizzy on 25Feb2021, just a little bit, couple of days after. Then on Saturday, 27Feb2021, he was the most fatigued he was. He really was lethargic to sit there. He did not have a temperature but felt a little achy. He felt it was just minor, not serious at all, nothing to be debilitated. He was not debilitated at all. The patient further stated that he maybe experienced a very strange side effect. He mentioned that he had hepatitis A in 1975 and did not drink for a couple of years to get his system better and to keep his liver from becoming scarred. This happened when he was 25-26 years old; though he enjoyed life of a moderate drinking with eating. Earlier on, maybe a few years after he had hepatitis, he would feel his liver ache a little. After the first shot, on 28Feb2021, he felt an ache in his liver and did not know what it was. It lasted 3-4 days on and off. He used Ginseng and changed the kind of what he used to take. He had to take it twice a day, each pill with 7% of ginsenosides so he got 14% in a day. He researched to see if there was any effect that his liver would have because he noticed that it happened a couple of hours after the ginseng. He had read about it on the internet, there were insights of ginseng interacting with medication and can possibly cause some form of liver damage. He stopped using ginseng and felt fine. The liver ache stopped after 4 days on 04Mar2021. That was when he stopped using the ginseng. It was only an ache nothing really a damage at all. It was an unusual may be a coincidental happening. He had the hepatitis A in 1975 then felt the liver ache most recently. He believed it could have been due to ginseng as COVID-19 vaccine was flowing through his body. The action taken in response to ginseng was permanently withdrawn in 04Mar2021.

The vaccine was administered to the patient at a pharmacy (in a grocery store). The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient's medical history included retired (retired registered nurse), ongoing depression (has had this condition for probably 20 years), ongoing lung cancer (has had this condition for probably 3 years), ongoing bipolar (has had this condition for about 4 years), ongoing emphysema (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years), and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years). Concomitant medications included duloxetine taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking this probably for 15 years); and arformoterol tartrate (BROVANA) (started taking this probably 5 years ago), budesonide (started taking this probably 5 years ago), tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) (has been taking this for probably about 4-5 years), oxygen (has been using this full time for 3 years), and Trilogy machine (she sleeps with this, it is an invasive intubation. She puts a big mask on and it pumps air in, pulls air out, letting her lungs rest. Her oxygen hooks up to it), all taken for emphysema and COPD from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported that she received the vaccine on 01Mar2021 and sometime in Apr2021 around Easter, she went to the hospital for COPD exacerbation, tiredness and weakness. The patient required a visit to the emergency room due to the events and reported that she went by ambulance to the hospital. The patient stated that she has these events often and it has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine. She went to the hospital with exacerbation of COPD and missed her date to get her last shot. She wanted to know whether she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine with her experience after the 1st dose. The patient reported that she now weighs 177 after she has been pumped full of cortisone. The patient reported that her lung doctor was really the one that manages her medical. The patient reported that she thinks she came home from the hospital the day before Easter and she was in the hospital for 5 days (in Apr2021). She was sick before that, at home, and she finally had to call # to come and get her. She believes she had to call # the 5th day before Easter, but she was not positive. When asked to clarify what she meant by sick, the patient explained she was extremely tired, she couldn't get out of bed and couldn't move. She was having trouble breathing. She was on oxygen 24/7 and sleeps with a trilogy machine so she was having a lot of trouble, it was awful. She said she then found out at the hospital her red blood cell was below 5 and her iron was critically low. They had to give her 2 units of blood and an infusion. Then she went back yesterday and got another infusion and she has to go back next week for another infusion. The patient confirmed that she was hospitalized for COPD. She then stated she didn't know the exact date of when she was discharged from the hospital, but she was thinking it was the day she was scheduled for her second shot. She then clarified she came home Easter. The patient reported that she can't do much without having to sit down, catch her breath, and rest a little bit. She was improving but not as fast as she'd like to. While reading the vaccine record card, the patient stated ""my eyes aren't as good as they used to be"". Her pulmonologist stated she was going to die if she doesn't take the vaccine. If she catches COVID she was not going to make it, so her pulmonologist thinks her chances are better with the vaccine than without it. The patient said she goes all the time to the hospital; therefore, she doesn't think the events were related to the vaccine. She had been sick several times. They can't do anything about the bleeding, they can't go in to do anything because of her lungs, her lungs were so bad. No further details were provided regarding the bleeding she was speaking of. The patient reported that duloxetine doesn't come as 90 mg so she takes a 30 mg and 60 mg tablet; she mixes the Brovana and Budesoind and takes them at the same time, twice a day. She was given an albuterol solution, 0.5mg PRN (as needed), for her emphysema/COPD. She says she just started taking this from her last hospital stay. The patient reported that she did not remember her iron count, just that it was critically low. She did remember asking the nurse what could happen, and the nurse said a lot of things such as infection. She confirmed tests were done in regards to the lung cancer. Her lungs were too critical for any kind of invasive tests.

I began to feel weak and tired; all I wanted to do was lay down.  I laid in bed and took my temperature via ear.  100.8 in the right ear and a reading of 101.2 in the left ear (I've not had a fever since maybe 12 years of age).  I was also experiencing a headache (back of head) and neck discomfort.  I felt hot, specifically ears and face.  I took 400mg of ibuprofen at approximately 7pm and 1000mg of acetaminophen at approximately 10pm.  by 10:30 my temp was 98.9.  I woke up at 1:30am on 4/17/21 and was completely drenched I sweat.  I assumed this was from the fever break but I woke up again at approximately 4am drenched again.  After waking and getting up around 8am on 4/17/21, I felt great; back to normal.  I went about my day.  I woke again around 1:30am on 4/18/21 with a sore neck and the back, lower area of the head hurting (this wasn't the same feeling as having a stiff neck or laying in an awkward position).  When I sat up, I felt some sore, throbbing on the top of my head which then subsided.  I woke again at 4:30am with the same issue.  I was also, again, completely drenched in sweat but no fever this time that I am aware of.  My pajamas were soaked.  I felt some relief with the head and neck discomfort when I got up at 6;30am.  As I type this now, my head and neck feel basically normal.  I also wish to report that in addition to injection site soreness which I think is always to be expected, I have been experiencing quite a bit of soreness and discomfort under my left arm.  It runs down my left side from my arm pit to the side of my left breast.  This area has been sore and tender since the evening of the day I received the shot (4/15/21).

A few miles down the road I started getting tingly on my left arm (where the shot was administered), then it traveled up to my face and down my left leg. I realized I was getting lightheaded but I was driving on Hwy 75 and needed an exit FAST. Thankfully I was safely able to exit and park in the Mall parking lot.  I called husband and my dr immediately to let them know where I was and I needed help. As I?m talking to them my throat started getting cottony and tight, and that tingly feeling that made it?s way down my left side was coming up my right side. When it got to my heart it hit my heart with a *boom* like a really hard heartbeat. I was seriously freaking out and thinking I am going to pass out and no one is going to be able to find me. My dr's office advised me to go to an ER. I found a small ER  across the highway from me and decided my lightheadedness had subsided enough that I could get there. They monitored me for an hour, gave me no meds, did an EKG and discharged me once they felt my symptoms had mostly stopped. No discharge instructions other than to follow up with my dr. My dr has never responded to my efforts to reach her. For the remainder of that day and the next day I continued to feel itchy, a cottony throat, and like I was getting pricked with needles all over my body, but specifically on my fingertips and the back of my knees. A friend suggested I take some Benadryl, and that drastically improved those lingering symptoms. I took 10ml of Children's liquid Benadryl on April 13 at 8:00pm, and since it made me feel better, I did the same dose again on April 14 at 9:00pm. I was doing fairly well other than being very tired and sleeping quite a bit: 5-6 extra hours each day. On April 16 at 4:45pm I stood up and then leaned all the way over to the ground to pick something up and my heart beat super hard again, and I felt like I was going to throw it up. I got lightheaded and my heart just hurt afterward so my husband took me to another ER.

I proceeded with second shot in February....she did not feel well, but just sorta didn't want to get up anymore. She slept more and more and more. Her appetite declined. I got her up and she was ravenous. She slept more and seemed in a lethargic way to take less and less interest. She was living independently and had been most of her life. We scheduled an internist report. She passed labs with flying colors....... when you are 96 they look at everything as remarkable ( will live for 10 more years).

I have also had the two shots.) One week out I was looking at Hospic eand long term care placement. Yesterday they couldn't get a diagnosis for Hospice ( the person sent to sign her up). I thought what? After all these tests and  maybe it is cardio, maybe it is exchemic  strokes, they don't have a diagnosis because she hasn't changed much since 2017? We have to take this totally fine independent  woman and in one week say, ""She has Dementia?"" It's possible but what caused it? It's not age......we live until we are 110. Yes, that MRI showed me little formations of clotting all over ( no major bleed if any in a lobe). Over the last week I have been looking at her health and how we just slowly went downhill.

1225620,04/18/2021,GA,73.0,,,F,,"Seven days after the 2nd Pfizer shot, I began experiencing discomfort and pain outside the vaginal area which gradually worsened over the next week.  Then I began having severe pain in my left lower back that moved to my hips and finally to my legs.  Thinking that it was related to an earlier diagnosed prolapsed uterus, I returned to my gyn.  By this time, I had also developed a rash in the area.  He diagnosed it as shingles, and I took Valtrex for a week.  Even tho the shingles area seemed to be better, the area closer to the vagina was much worse with rawness, burning, and itching.  Out of desperation, I sought help from my dermatologist.  She and her PA diagnosed me as having lichen sclerosus.  I'm using Corbetasol ointment to treat this, but still suffering from this problem. Even tho the scientists and medical professions may not be willing to admit any relationship of my problems to the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I'm convinced that it IS related, especially since I have had neutropenia for about the last twenty years, and I know that my immune system is somewhat compromised.  Since I'm not a scientist or medical doctor, I'm unable to explain how this could have happened, but I know my body and combined with my excellent common sense, I'm convinced there's a relationship to what I've been experiencing since receiving the 2nd Pfizer Covid shot.  I've never expressed this to my gyn, or my dermatologist.  Neither even asked about if I'd received the vaccine, and I didn't bother to tell them because I don't believe they would have acknowledged any relationship because the medical field, as well as everyone else were assured of its safety.  I report this only to perhaps save someone else for the extreme suffering and misery that I've gone through.",,,,,,,,,N,03/09/1921,03/17/2021,36533,Dr diagnosed in his office as shingles.

I then noticed itching, swelling and pain at the site of the injection and developed a mild headache, called my primary doctor on 4/13/21 and was seen on 4/14/21 at which time a CBC was done.  CBC including platelets-normal.  However, within the next few days a more severe headache then developed, which was severe enough to limit my activities by 4/16/21. Because of the rare problem of thrombocytopenia associated with clotting, it was advised I not take aspirin or ibuprofen. I also was having some mild abdominal pain, low grade fever (to 100.7), malaise, dysuria and arthralgias. My headache continued to be limiting my daily activities and on 4/17/21, I went to a Urgent Care. However, they were unable to check and get results back on a CBC within that day, I had a normal neurological exam, my UA had some abnormal findings but not clearly indicative of a UTI and a culture is pending.  A rapid Covid test was negative.  It was recommended that if I was concerned I could proceed to a local ED for further testing. I  decided to continue to try conservative treatment and monitoring at home. As of today 4/18/21, the headache has mostly resolved and I no longer have a fever. I am still having some dysuria and joint pains.",,,,,,,,,,04/08/2021,04/13/2021,5,,PVT,,,,,Shingrix approximately 2-3 years prior,,2,04/18/2021,,Y,Y,"Previous allergic reaction to vaccine, previous allergic reaction to some antibiotics"

The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.

A few times a month now, I eat a handful of peanuts or so, just to make sure I can continue to eat them.  I made a stir-fry dinner that used peanut butter as a thickener a few days after the shot, and I couldn't eat it.  It made my mouth itch, which is another one of my allergy symptoms.  I had just a few bites, but I felt off for the rest of the evening.  The next day I tried to smell a jar of peanuts, and the smell made me queasy.  After about two weeks, I was fine, and I can eat peanuts again with no problems.  However, my seasonal allergies are much worse this year, and I've been having random dizzy spells, usually after eating, but also if I stand up too quickly or if I have a sudden exertion like going from sitting to running up the steps.

The chest pains are associated with shortness of breath (onset 28Mar2021). Stated when he couldn't turn over, he was laying on his side and that didn't help his breathing. He commented that he has Parkinson's Disease, and knowing the symptoms, it included most of these but not all, but his have gotten worse. They do blood pressure tests every morning to monitor and temperature checks and he never had a fever during that period, never had anything higher than 97 range. States he had a little bit of adverse effects after the first vaccine in Feb2021 but the main symptoms, the severe tremor and frozen all worsened after the second vaccine in Mar2021, about the second day after the second injection. There was no Emergency Room  visit; they asked him about going and they were considering it when had the frozen muscles and couldn't move . There was no Physician Office visit;  he talked to both his primary doctor and his Parkinson's doctor, over the phone and they recommended changes in the medication but he  hasn't started them yet. The outcome of the events Tremors of hands, feet, and leg, when he tries to move or get up in bad at night, he is frozen and can't move, muscles are weak and he has trouble with balance especially when he gets up, and it is more pronounced, and Muscle cramps, and Parkinson's Disease/ gotten worse, are not recovered. The outcome of the excessive sweating was unknown. The patient further commented ""maybe there needs to be a warning for people with Parkinson's because they both have had rather strong reactions.""

Her heart monitor never showed Atrial Fibrillation after one year of being monitored. Ongoing low thyroid/hypothyroidism and blood cholesterol increased from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for low thyroid/hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date (started probably been 10 years) and ongoing; atorvastatin taken for reduce cholesterol from 2020 (started right after she had stroke, either Jan2020 or Feb2020) and ongoing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks).

She was fine right after the first dose. She only had a sore arm for 3 days. Just last week, she had a severe adverse reaction right after her vaccine. With the second dose, she had everything possible. Twelve hours after, on 23Mar2021 at 03:00, she awoke to throw up.  She thinks she fainted.  She had to throw up 2 more times that night. She had been wearing a heart monitor. On 24Mar2021 her cardiologist called her and told her she had a 19 second pause of no heartbeat and was in a 3rd degree heart block. The very next morning, they put in a pacemaker. She was overall healthy and athletic. She was a runner and golfs all the time. She had an outpatient procedure for the pacemaker placement at the hospital on 25Mar2021. She was still recovering but improving. Caller added it was scary when your heart stops. Caller added she did not see this as a possible related side effect, but that evening when she was not feeling well, 22Mar2021, she checked her oxygen level with her oximeter. It was 93 and usually runs around 99. It is back to normal now. She checked it the night she was vomiting. Stated this was before the third degree heart block by a few hours.

Tonsil swelling was quite pronounced by 2am (nearly twelve hours after the injection) and blocked the airway when head was turned to the left, necessitating a makeshift pillow brace to keep head turned to the right overnight.  Tonsil swelling began to diminish by about 6am and only slight enlargement remains thirty hours after injection.  Additionally, a low-grade fever began at about 10 pm (~7 hours after injection) and reached a maximum of 100.5 degrees F approximately twenty-four hours after the injection.  By twenty-eight hours, temperature was within normal limits (though still nearly a degree higher than typical for this patient).  As of this writing, some thirty hours after the injection, headache, neck ache, and eye-ache persist, but none is severe.  Symptoms appear to be continuing their improvement.  I (the patient/recipient) hope the second installment of the vaccine is no worse than this one.  The only truly alarming symptom was the swollen tonsil and some thought was given to seeking medical attention, but the pillow brace seemed to do the trick for keeping the airway open, so no assistance was sought.

Slightly beaded contour of the M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery is noted, but findings could be technical, and MRA may be considered for further evaluation. Intradural right vertebral artery appears dominant and the left is relatively smaller and further tapers distally, which could be developmental. Basilar artery remains patent to the basilar terminus. - CTA NECK: * GREAT VESSELS: The thoracic aorta measures 2.5 cm in the partially included transverse portion of the arch. Right and left common carotid arteries maintain uniform caliber and enhancement at each carotid bifurcation. * RIGHT ICA: No stenosis or significant plaque.  No dissection. * LEFT ICA: A  4.4 x 6 x 6.2 mm filling defect is noted in the lateral aspect of the left carotid bulb, without discrete mural thickening or luminal narrowing, and may relate to an atherosclerotic plaque or a web.  No narrowing of the proximal cervical ICA or discrete intraluminal flap is noted to suggest a dissection at this time. * VERTEBRAL ARTERIES: Patent extracranial segments, dominant right and smaller left vertebral artery, likely developmental..

On 06-APR-2021, the patient's swelling was not going down and she visited her primary care physician.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto's - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn't mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn't have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn't walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can't walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn't , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven't had it since. It's almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could've affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn't know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn't know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn't want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can't explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn't want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn't mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn't really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn't know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles.

This is case 5 of 5 (cross reference: 18000140LT, 18000141LT, 18000142LT, and 18000143LT).   A 23 year old healthy female experienced suspected myopericarditis following vaccination with ACAM2000.  In April 2018, the patient received a first dose of ACAM2000 (Lot Unknown). Approximately 8-11 days after vaccination, she presented to the Emergency department with an acute onset of chest pain but without complaints of recent body aches, fever, or respiratory symptoms that may be suggestive of influenza-type illness. Other clinical signs at presentation included shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dizziness, chills and fever. Her troponin was negative. She received follow up care with a cardiologist for 6 months and underwent serial cardiac imaging. Additionally she was placed on limited duty with no exercise for six weeks with non-deployable status for at least six months.  She was followed by a Cardiologist until complete recovery at between three and nine months.  Laboratory Data included:  Flu A/B (rapid Ag) - Negative Coxsackie A7, A9, A16, A24, (IgG/IgM) - A-9/A-24 IgG*/IgM- Parvo B19 (IgG/IgM) - IgG+/IgM- Epstein Interpretation - Past Infection Epstein Barr Virus Capsid Ab IgG - Positive Epstein Barr Virus Ab - Negative Epstein-Barr Virus Capsid Ab IgM - Negative  Epstein Barr Virus Early Ab IgG - Negative Epstein Barr Virus Nuclear Ab IgG - Positive Adenovirus Ab - Negative Cytomegalovirus DNA PCR - Negative Viral Culture - Negative Enterovirus - Negative Parechovirus - Negative  The authors concluded that there was no significant difference observed between the rate seen and the published rates that occurred during the clinical trials. The available evidence suggested that the 5 cases were not an unexpected elevation in the rate of the disease or condition, but rather a predictable number of myopericarditis cases proportional to the increased number of vaccinations performed during a short period of time.  Company comments: This article was a retrospective analysis and detail of the cases were not specific. This case was associated with a suspected  myocarditis.

Then the lower part of her face, spreading down into her windpipe and clavicle area, then her  (outer 2 toes on each foot, pinky and next finger) started to get numb and tingly, as well as the upper lip.  As the day wore on that evening the feeling went to the either side of her spine, the numbness and tingling.  She waited to see if it dissipated, and called her doctor on Monday 3/15/21 and saw a PA who felt that she may have upset her whole nerve system and told her that it was going to take a while for it to straighten out.  She consulted with her PCP and gave her some samples of Horizant, but she did not try it as she has multiple allergies to medications.   She also from the time of her vaccine that she started to get horrible burning and tingling throughout her body everywhere, (arms, stomach) woke her up from sleep.   The other symptoms previously mentioned continued as well.  On Wednesday 3/17/21, called her cardiologist who told her to call the hospital and perhaps go to the hospital and they told her to call her doctor.  The cardiologist told her she needed to see a neurologist who she saw on 3/31/21.  The patient was afraid she had Guillain Barre syndrome, and the neurologist felt that if that was the case and that she would not have been able to walk at this point.  She did the neurologic testing, and she was going to give her Gabapentin (which she had already been given samples of and did not want to take).  The burning and tightness of her face down to her throat/clavicle area was concerning to her and still continues.  Her conclusion was that if she got worse to go to the hospital, and the basically do not know what to do.  She herself is wanting to know if this is going to disappear, and what are the long-term affects.

Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.

His pulse is 98?99 continues to have elevated blood pressure.  Pulse oximetry 98-100% on room air, normal.  Pharmacist will enter the reaction into the CDC/FDA/Pfizer database.

Difficulty breathing, pain, extreme swelling over upper abdomen when I even drank water to swallow morning Hydrochlorothiazide pill and would stay swollen for 4-8 hours with continued surprise to me gulps of air throughout period, weak, nausea but not vomiting, dizzy, unable to walk more than a few steps at a time, fever taken and wavered from 95 to 99 degrees (my usual body registered 97.8 degrees) but never over 99 degrees, and only over 97.8 degrees perhaps three times very little above it and only for a few hours.  >>I went to Urgent Care in person no better at all on 3/24/21/roughly day 12 after vaccine shot 3/11/21 (Urgent Care) which took blood and urine tests determining roaring infection and blood in tests and a CT CONTRAST scan should be ordered by my PCP asap at appt PCP already scheduled 3/26/21 but she couldn't order CONTRAST version the PCP would need to and she prescribed three antibiotics to take over next 2 weeks >> I went to PCP 3/26/21/day 14 after vaccine shot and he ordered CT Scan but insurance required pre-auth and they refused it at first so PCP referred me to GI SPECIALIST who again referred me for CT CONTRAST test, which I did have on Friday afternoon 4/16/21 (Clinic), and I await the results today 4/19/21.  Today I continue to have pain abdomen, though softer and throbbing, same C-shaped region, HUGE issue even drinking water with Hydrochlorothiazide pill only for many hours as abdomen swells at bottom bra-line center in a palm size mound for hours, and back hurts badly, solid headache which may be only right side of head more than left but I am taking nothing for any symptoms afraid of GI issue.  NOTING AGAIN: Yes I was diagnosed roughly 2015 with a single incidence of diverticulitis/osis by GI SPECIALIST in Town and went through series of Colonoscopies and tests, but tests only determined incidental few polyps removed over all tests and no incidents at all since that. Knowing what I know of my body and health, the trigger seemed to be the first shot of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccination which remarkably seemed to react first with a few days of better health than I have had for decades (eating, moving, energy etc. for my age), where after days of extreme great health and energy (where I went nowhere, and still did not push myself much) my body then crashed to unable to move much or even breath normally for many days after and with a multi-level infection in my gut that needed three antibiotics and after those I still hurt in the same locations.  I cannot confidently rule out the Vaccine as the cause, and what I know of my body suggests in fact some ""overdrive"" function in my system was triggered and then caused the crash that resulted in infection and that continues to interfere with my walking, eating, moving, breathing, and even drinking a small glass of water today.  Final note: PCP confirmed I should take the second Vaccine Pfizer shot, which I did on 4/1/21 - same site, Lot #EW0150, after which second vaccine shot I had the same two days of dull arm pain, and I continued to finish the antibiotics until finished (but pain though softer continues to today).  I did not experience a #-Days HYPER-WELL episode then HYPER-CRASH after this second vaccine shot, only the arm ache, but throughout was still very unwell (breathing, pain, no activity, weak, unable to eat, swelling, headache, cough intermittent, back hurts, etc.) throughout, and same to this day 4/19/21 as I await CT CONTRAST results.

Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I've ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.

By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain.

I was sick for about three weeks after flying to and from in November 2020, and tested positive for antibodies in mid-December and tested positive for antibodies again the day before I received the vaccine, so based on that and the few articles I found online, it seems maybe if you get the vaccine after already having COVID, you react to the first dose and not the second.

She rolled up my eyelids and said that I had bumps under my eyelids from severe inflammation. I had been using, at home, an OTC allergy eyedrop - Ketotisin Fumerate - that wasn't helping.

She described it as a toxic conjunctivitis. The steroid drops did help. I went back for a follow up and it was improved.
