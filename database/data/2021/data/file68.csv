Was no longer able to line-dance, etc. Was fatigued. Her friends became concerned and encouraged her to seek medical attention, patient reported that she had was prescribed ""water pill"" and told to ""lay off salt,"". Friends later found out that she had lied about doctor's visit and was self-medicating with over the counter  ""water pills"" for all of the water weight she was gaining. Eventually developed worsening shortness of breath. Admitted to hospital on 5/4 with shortness of breath and worsening abdominal pain. Found to have systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%) and was in SVT. Also diagnosed with UTI and SMV thrombus. Grossly anasarcic on exam. Treated for heart failure with diuretic and for her UTI with antibiotics, was started on Heparin drip for SMV thrombus. Underwent left heart catheterization at OSH that was negative for significant CAD. Developed worsening septic shock and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Unfortunately had ongoing decline, found to be fungemic. Eventually succumbed to her septic shock, passed away on 5/14/21.  Patient had second dose of vaccine on 3/18/21 according to vaccine card in her purse. Friend states that because of symptoms she developed after first dose of vaccine, she was fearful of getting second dose.  Friends insist that she was well before the vaccine---knee pain was limiting factor for her activity level, never shortness of breath. Of note, several friends tested positive for COVID on 2/11/21, the week prior to patient receiving her vaccine. Patient tested negative and reportedly got tested at frequent intervals and was always negative.",Y,05/14/2021,,,Y,10,,,N,02/18/2021,02/19/2021,1,N/a,PVT,,Aspirin 81mg daily Omeprazole 20mg daily,None reported,Osteoarthritis s/p bilateral knee replacements,,,2,05/14/2021,,,,NKDA

She was admitted to the hospital for treatment and was in the intensive care unit for about 9 days.  She was given seizure medicine along with other fluids to keep her hydrated and fed.  Multiple EEGs were taken to track the electrical activity within her brain - which even with high doses of medication was very active.  A spinal tap was done to test for infection and no viruses were found.  An MRI was completed to identify what part of the brain was being impacted.   The area of the brain that was impacted was the side and the images showed it was very inflamed.  She has since been moved to a physical therapy facility to try to help her improve.  At this time, she still needs assistance for all activities and would not be able to return home due to the level of care she needs.  Her current diagnosis is autoimmune encephalitis.  She has never had seizures before and this one began about two weeks after receiving her first dose of the COVID-19 shot.

About 10 days later,  self-checked more carefully and discovered that an artery or vein that runs from the lower part of my breast (slightly to the right side of the nipple) all the way up to near my armpit tightens and hardens to form a cord like lineage when I move my right arm up and to the side.  The situation worsened overtime. About 20 days later, the cord runs down further and I felt small bumps near it on the bottom part. Now, The cord on the upper part seems to have softened, but it developed further down into abdomen area and it hurts.  The symptom also looks like the Mondor disease.

The product was salvaged under the Senior technician, as he had visually instructed both of them how to correctly salvage unused vaccine before he left his shift at 6:30 pm. Once salvaged, neither employee correctly placed the vial in the hazardous waste bin and left in on the counter in the vaccine area of the pharmacy.  On the morning of 5.14.21, the opening pharmacist, and opening technicians, saw the unused vaccine vial from the previous evening 5.13.21, and did not correctly dispose of the vial nor quarantine the vial. They explained they did not know where to dispose of it and was waiting on senior tech to arrive for his shift for further direction.  At 10am, when the first patient arrived for a vaccine, tech checked in the patient and gave patient the VAR. While patient was filling out VAR, tech removed one Moderna vial from the refrigerator so the vaccine could come to room temperature for the appropriate amount of time. She popped the plastic vial lid off of the vial and cleaned the rubber stopper with alcohol. Once the patient was through filling out the VAR, technician  took over the transaction and headed to the vaccine area. Technician saw that 2 vials were present, unknowing that one vial was expired and quaratined, and added a tik mark to the Moderna Beyond Use Time label thinking 6 shots had already been given earlier in the day and drew up the syringe on current and 2 additional patients from the expired vial. This is verified by the tik marks added to the Beyond Use Label by tech in a different colored ink pen. At a point after these three said immunizations were given, senior tech saw that there was 2 vials on the counter realizing that one vial was from the day before and correctly disposed of the vial.  Later in the day, senior tech told everyone to remember to put tick marks on the vials they use and tech said she had placed her tiks on the 1st vial Beyond Use Label. Senior tech said there was no vial from earlier and asked if she has used the expired vial before he got there. Tech said she drew up at least 3 shots from the unknowingly expired vial.  Upon learning this information, senior tech looked for the on duty pharmacist,  as she heard the same information that was just presented. Pharmacist asked senior tech to go ahead and reach out to the pharmacy manager,  to make sure we correctly document this in system. Pharmacist then reached out to store manager,  to go over the correct standard operation procedures of this said event.

Follow-up #01 (PRD/SRD 13Apr2021) received from a contactable consumer was processed together with initial information.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8737) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 07Apr2021 (at 12:30 or 1:00pm) as single dose, 0.3 ML, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 08Apr2021, patient experienced persistent pain in neck, upper back area. On 09Apr2021, diarrhea that lasted a few days and upset stomach. On an unspecified date, patient mentioned that in the morning its worse, and it took her 20 mins to get out of bed, she didn't know if it was lymph nodes swelling or if it was something else. Patient believed that she was having a side effect from dose number one. She has had a persistent pain in her neck/upper back area from the morning after she got the vaccine. She never had neck pain before, so she had been watching it. She said it hurt pretty bad and it's gotten worse. It was moderate to severe. She was waiting for her doctor to call her back. Patient mentioned that in the information she was given, this side effect wasn't stated so she was wondering if it was normal or what she should do. Patient also reported that she had read a bunch of threads online about people reporting neck pain after the Pfizer vaccine and some had mentioned lymph node swelling. The patient also reported that on 07Apr2021, with her first COVID 19 vaccine she had this muscle pain on her shoulder, back and neck area on the side where she got the COVID 19 vaccine. It began like a day after she received the COVID 19 vaccine. The pain kept getting worse and by day 7 or 8, after the vaccine, the pain was really bad, and she couldn't lift her head up when she would wake up in the morning. She tried to contact her primary care doctor but didn't hear back from that office. Her muscle pain finally started to go away. She spoke to someone at Pfizer  about 2 weeks ago who was going over statistics with her from the clinical study that was done. The patient was told that 21 percent of people experienced new or worsened muscle pain. Nothing else had changed in any other area of her life or any other activity. The only outlier was the COVID 19 vaccine. That's why she called because it was severe pain. She wanted to go to the emergency department but what was waiting to hear back from her primary care doctor, but that office never got back to her. It was scary, she couldn't lift her head for a few days, and she took Ibuprofen. Now her second COVID 19 vaccine was scheduled in 2 days on 05May2021. She felt very hesitant about getting the second vaccine. She lived alone and she didn't want to go through her muscle pain again. She didn't want her family to have to drive to her house to help her. She was following up with Pfizer to see if there was any guidance on whether someone with her experience should receive her second COVID 19 vaccine. She reported that she called her doctor 2 to 3 times daily for 3 days and never spoke to anyone from that office. By then the weekend was there. On the third day of trying to call her doctor, she left her doctor a crazy voicemail because it was not right that no one was returning her calls and her doctor was unavailable to her. At the time she had a change of work status, so she didn't have health insurance. She had health insurance now and had not seen a new doctor. Her muscle pain was still lingering. She was been trying to do neck exercises and stretches. She was never had pain in that area before. The patient spoke to a girl who worked at the urgent care. This girl who answered the phone at the urgent care told the patient that the same thing happened to her, it was all neck pain. At that point, the patient was aware that what she experienced had happened to someone else. The patient was trying to confirm if her neck pain was related to the vaccine or not but the girl who answered the phone at the urgent care, didn't really say anything else. There was not a product complaint to report. There was a medical information request. Further probing could not be done as consumer hung up the call abruptly. Hence, limited information was available over the call. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Company opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of worsening of right shoulder torn rotator cuff, worsening of right frozen shoulder, worsening of right upper arm bone spurs, right arm bicep muscle were torn, rheumatoid arthritis flare up, limited mobility was on a sling due to shoulder surgery onset in 2021, itchy throat due to seasonal allergy onset in 2021, cough, sore arms, fatigue, limited mobility/was on a sling due to shoulder surgery onset in 2021 and Post procedural swelling are related to HUMIRA (adalimumab).  Relevant laboratory and other diagnostic tests: 19Jan2021 shoulder magnetic resonance imaging: right shoulder torn rotator cuff, right frozen shoulder and right upper arm bone spurs.  Change history: On 05Apr2021, received updates to medical history, event information, reporter opinion of causality, company opinion of causality, company alternative etiology, suspect drug information, concomitant drug information, treatment drug information, past drug information, laboratory and diagnostic procedures and narrative description. The events of 'worsening of right frozen shoulder', 'worsening of right upper arm bone spurs', 'right arm bicep muscle were torn', 'rheumatoid arthritis flare up', 'limited mobility was on a sling due to shoulder surgery', 'itchy throat due to seasonal allergy', 'cough', 'sore arms' and 'fatigue' were added. The event of 'surgery' was amended to 'worsening of right shoulder torn rotator cuff'. The event of 'swelling in right finger' was removed.  The reporter considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the reported events Pain in arm and Fatigue were related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. The reporter's assessment of the causal relationship of the other reported events with BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the Company causality assessment.; Sender's Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, there is a reasonable possibility that events Pain in arm and Fatigue were related to suspect drug.  The other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

By dinnertime, closer to 18:00-19:00 on 23Apr2021, she started experiencing difficulty walking and with her speech. She was concerned about having a stroke but that she is active and generally healthy. This was unusual for her and she started feeling pain through her body and overall feeling like crap. She did not expect the neurological stuff. By the end of the night on 23Apr2021, she realized she was not feeling good and went to the hospital either that night on 23Apr2021 or early the next day on 24Apr2021 and was admitted to the hospital. The patient stated that her cognition was not there, and her speech was kind of slurry, she felt like everything was slowing, and did not feel like herself. She could not get up unassisted, could not get up out of the bed, chair, or go to bathroom, and still requires the use of a walker and bedside commode, but now with the walker and assistance caller can make it to the bathroom. She also had problems with breathing, but she had a negative COVID-19 PCR test in Apr2021 both arriving to and leaving from the hospital; she did not believe them to be COVID-19 symptoms. At the hospital they did an x-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on her brain in Apr2021 with unknown results. They gave her 3 or 4 intravenous (IV) unspecified medications and she had her complete blood count (CBC) labs done in Apr2021 with unknown results. There was an issue with her lungs, and she is currently waiting for her doctor to read report to see if there is an issue there. The patient stated that she never experienced anything like this after a vaccine. She cannot even get up and move around it is pretty serious. Caller states that at first when she had the symptoms, she thought she was going to wait it out, maybe her immune system is overresponding, give it a chance to resolve. She reported that she  could not stand up, legs were shaking and that she had pain that was from her breasts down; felt like a ton of bricks. The patient stated that she is cognitively alert now, speaking normal. There are times it goes in waves where she feels like she can walk with walker but then a few hours later that is not the case. On Tuesday, 27Apr2021 night, the patient had a light dinner but then she was vomiting. Caller states that the pain was throughout her body and felt like someone lighting firecrackers. The patient initially stated 28Apr2021 was when the cough started, but later clarified she first noticed it on 27Apr2021, but at that time she was vomiting and thought it was due to that. However, the next day 28Apr2021, she still had this cough and that the cough was getting worse. She felt like she has a respiratory issue and has been coughing. She was not able to stay awake, even without taking any medications. She does take medications regularly but did not take the medications those days and not having medications would not cause sleepiness. She thought the doctor gave her sedative, but they did not. She states she had fatigue to the point where she was dead asleep, and nurse would come in to take vitals or do whatever and she would wake up suddenly with someone in front of her. She was sitting up with the nurse trying to read the discharge instructions and she fell asleep sitting up. She also complained of stomach pain. The patient had not been to work and not been having to use her brain and talking like she would for 8+ hours a day. She stated that the cough hurts, it feels like somebody is lighting firecrackers in her body. It also feels like this when she sneezes; the nerve response is strong. She reported that it is not a constant hacking cough, not really a dry cough; the cough is in-between productive and dry cough and cough is a bit better now and worse towards the evening. She still has swelling in her feet and hands. It looks like it has gone down a bit. She has a history of neuropathy and that her fingers are going numb holding the phone now. She got the shot in her left arm and those fingers are going numb. She was so tired and feels like did not get enough sleep. The fatigue had a slight improvement. She is more awake than when she was in the hospital. However, it depends as the day goes on, she is wiped out and has to go lay down. She stated that her nerve response is affected, and she had a difficult time with the neuro exam in Apr2021 with unknown results in the hospital. She was having an issue with her arms. She can't say anything about whether it affected her vision because she already has a hard time with her vision. She stated that she was throwing up pretty bad; the pain was really severe through her whole body while vomiting. After the vomiting stopped, the coughing got worse and she was coughing a little bit before the vomiting, but during the vomiting it was to the point she felt like she was drowning. She reported that she was vomiting through her nose and aspirating. After her MRI she started to get a really bad headache. Then when the nurse was coming to read the discharge information, she started to get sweats. She is not menopausal so she cannot blame the sweating on menopause, as reported. The patient also had arm soreness, but does not care about that long as it does not leave any scars. This was not a big deal for her at all. This started  shortly after getting the vaccine.

She says it's weird, nothing like this has ever happened before. She doesn't have a problem with fizzing out for a couple seconds. Caller states she doesn't want to use mini-seizure because then that marks her of having epilepsy. She also states that her doctor told her not to describe it as a seizure because they are not sure what it is yet. She wants to use the term fizz out for a min. Fizzing out for a minute: She clarified and states that the last two times this happened she did not fizz out, but she still just peed out of nowhere, without even having a sensation of having to pee. The last time she fizzed out was 10Apr2021. She doesn't know what to do and she is hoping that it gets figured out. She went four days without anything happening and then she was waiting in line and it just happened. She states she just urinated but doesn't recall fizzing out.

She says they are trying her on diff medications for asthma; they changed it, added more. She says Advair work beautifully and she doesn't use a breakthrough inhaler. She says ever since COVID in 2020, the first week of FEB2020 she thought it was the flu. She says she didn't get any medical help, she was in severe shape, and her headache was severe. She says she crawled to the bathroom once a day, she had a high fever and it felt like a snake effect of a cobra all over, squeezing.   She says her pulmonologist gave her Spiriva and that has opened her up, once a day. Caller had gotten to the point she couldn't take 5 or 6 steps and couldn't breath. She gained a ton of weight cause she couldn't move related to this breathing issue. She thought she wouldn't recover, he gave samples once a month. She says she saw him a week ago, 10 days ago maybe. She says she had shortness of breath and couldn't walk. She clarifies she is talking about when she had COVID last year, not this current shot report. She says she didn't consider these current side effects a problem, she expected some side effects and they went way. She says the shortness of breath walking problem was due to shortness of breath; that was what happened with COVID. She says her hoarseness is related to spring allergies and is due to the climate and it is usually from 10APR to 16JUN. She says she gets a sinus drip and congestion and that she is on 5 different medications for that. She says she has more trouble with inhouse allergies. She says she gets trouble as soon as the trees pop. She has had hoarseness for about a year and the allergies have really started around 10Mar2021 for this year. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid cancer. She says something new was 8 weeks out she got the flu shot. She says she has a lethal allergy to egg white so she has never had a flu shot her entire life. She says she asked her doctor why they didn't get the one without egg whites. She says they made one without egg white in the 1990's. She says 08DEC2020 was her first flu shot. She says everyone wants her to take more shots but she won't take any more. She says COVID and the flu shot are enough for one year. She says if they have the COVID booster then she will take that one but not any other. She says no but she was told don't ever have anything with egg white in it so she never had the flu shot, she refused.

She says the second shot was at 11:00 am. She says the second shot was on 25FEB2021.

She says she she lives in a senior housing area, they all got it at the same time, that there was only one person who declines. She says almost everyone had sleepiness for at least 3 days afterwards. She says she is still battling the COVID after effects, it was disrupting her breathing. She says she was glad she got the shot, she is glad she was able to do it.

Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia from Dec2020 and ongoing; ongoing blood pressure high; she was diagnosed with high blood pressure post pregnancy. She said the last 6 weeks of her pregnancy she had toxemia. Her blood pressure was up, then went back down, and then shot back up. She experienced tachycardia at the time too. She took atenolol for 46 years for her high blood pressure. She was confident she had the COVID-19 Virus in Jan2020 before anyone knew about the pandemic. She and her husband got the COVID-19 vaccine so they could visit family, whose son was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. They were planning to go in Jun2021 for a visit, and her husband's family wouldn't let them visit unless both of them had the COVID-19 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included in the morning of 18Mar2021 she took atenolol 25 mg tablet that was dispensed in a pharmacy. She regularly took atenolol 25 mg, twice a day. She also took olmesartan 5 mg (NDC Number: 16729-320-15, Lot Number: M2015864, Expiration Date: Oct2022). She regularly took olmesartan 5 mg, twice a day. She clarified 4 days after her second COVID-19 Vaccine, her cardiologist's Nurse Practitioner increased her olmesartan dose from 5 mg twice a day to olmesartan 10 mg, twice a day. The increased Olmesartan dosage gave her a monstrous headache. The cardiologist's nurse practitioner told her she would also need a blood test to make sure the olmesartan increased dose wasn't affecting her kidneys. Her primary care doctor asked how she was tolerating the increased olmesartan dose. She told her doctor she wasn't happy that the olmesartan could affect her kidneys and the headaches were killers. Her doctor told her that headaches were a side effect of olmesartan. She stayed on the increased olmesartan dosage for 3 weeks before her primary care doctor decreased her olmesartan dose back to 5 mg, twice a day on 17Apr2021. She said she had to go back to her doctor on 17May2021 for a follow-up appointment. She said her headaches were not as frequent since she reduced the olmesartan dose to 5 mg, twice a day. She still had headaches in the morning, and headaches at night, but was OK during the day. She treated her headaches with a cold cloth on her forehead. She said if her headache was extreme, she would take generic acetaminophen 500 mg caplet (100 caplets/bottle, NDC Number: 36800-484-78, Lot Number: GE2569C, Expiration Date: Apr2022) a couple times. She had to use a magnifying glass to read the Acetaminophen 500 mg caplet product label as the type was very tiny of the product label, and she was using reading glasses. She took regularly hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene (TRIAMTERENE/HCTZ, manufacturer Lannett) 37.5 mg/25 mg tablet, once a day. Primary care doctor kept her on regular visits to monitor her blood pressure. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6205) Intramuscular in her left arm on 25Feb2021 had no reaction to the first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said within 30 minutes after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine on 18Mar2021, her heart was racing. Her heart felt like it was fluttering in her chest. She said she felt very hot and was not comfortable. She said in the car, on the way home from getting her second COVID-19 Vaccine, her husband wanted to take her to the Emergency Room. She said she didn't feel it was critical, and her heart racing felt like the tachycardia she had experienced in the past. She said she called the COVID-19 Vaccination facility when she got home. She said she was told by them to lay down and rest for a while to see if that helped, and if she had chest pain or wasn't feeling better, to go to the Emergency Room. She said she went to bed, and laid down at their suggestion, and it took about 48 hours for her heart rate to settle down completely. She clarified when she first checked her heart rate, her heart rate was 116. She said prior to the COVID-19 Vaccine, her normal resting heart rate was 58, and now her resting heart rate is around 66. She said her blood pressure went out of control, too, and she had not been able to get her blood pressure under control since. She said she checked her blood pressure when she got home from her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her blood pressure would go up and then come down. She said the highest blood pressure reading she experienced (after getting her second COVID-19 Vaccine) was 201/116, and her lowest blood pressure reading (since then) was 152/96. She said her blood pressure at 11:00 PM last night (29Apr2021) was 168/93. She said prior to getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, her blood pressure averaged 139/83 with her lowest reading being 121/79. She said now her blood pressure readings average between 155-165/80s. She said her primary care doctor, and her cardiologist were in touch with each other about her medications. She said she breezed through her first COVID-19 Vaccine, but the second COVID-19 Vaccine had took a toll on her. She said from 2021 she had no energy and couldn't get out of her own way now. She said she was not the typical 75-year-old. She said she didn't retire until she was 70-year-old and was very active up until the time she received her second COVID-19 Vaccine. The events require a visit to physician office. She didn't take any over-the-counter or prescription medications for Heart Racing, but went to bed, laid down, and rested. She was very cautious about taking over-the-counter medications with her prescription medications. She said she tried to limit taking over-the-counter medications because she thought it was safer to do so. She checked her blood pressure when she got home from her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had been tracking and checking her blood pressure, and took her blood pressure readings to her primary care doctor. She said her doctor made a copy of her blood pressure readings and put the blood pressure readings in her medical file. She said her blood pressure would go up and then come down. She said the highest blood pressure reading she experienced (after getting her second COVID-19 Vaccine) was 201/116, and her lowest blood pressure reading (since then) was 152/96.

1320448,05/15/2021,MN,14.0,14,,M,,"Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be +8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with +1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils +6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary.

I developed sharp twitching of my limbs, fingers, and one night, even my tongue. A mild tremor that I had been feeling since a prior medication reaction (Tamoxifen) suddenly escalated.  Over the next week, the tremor began to have the same electrical quality in my upper arms and legs. It reminds me at times of that feeling when you chew on tinfoil. The shaking (whole body) wakes me at night and at times makes it impossible to drive, write, weave, or play my musical instrument. This week, I've had moments where my head literally wags like a dog's tail. My feet Charlie horse painfully.

Her eyes were starting to roll, but I knew she was breathing because she was screaming to not let her die. Her mother was with her and was very nervous and wanted emergency services, so We called 911. I took the girls hands and asked her to look me in the eyes and follow my deep breaths, because I began to think it was more of a panic attack. She followed by breaths and regained some composure but was sweating profusely, so I began fanning her. After a while of talking her through taking deep breaths and assuring her she was breathing and we had emergency services on the way, she began to calm down. EMS showed up about 15-20 minutes later and she declined to go with them. I stayed with the patient the entire time. She did not faint.

1321264,05/15/2021,AL,28.0,28,,M,,"Issue: I have been dealing with nerve pain in my left arm from a terribly placed tetanus shot (Td) by immunizations since 22 Feb 21. I felt pain immediately after the shot. On a 1-10 scale, this pain stays at a 7 every hour of every day, with a break only occurring at night due to the CNS depressants (Flexeril) and Lidocaine patches. I have pins and needles type tingling flowing from the injection site all the way down to all fingers on the left arm. The second I wake back up; the pain cycle repeats. I have lost most of my range of motion in that arm (at least 50%). Believe this condition to be SIRVA (Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration).  Record of ?care?: 22 February 2021: The nurse who administered the immunization did not project or estimate where she would place the shot or bunch up the muscle with her hand, she simply jabbed it near my shoulder bone (way too high on the arm) which led me to believe the needle punctured the bursa sac & hit a nerve. The moment she did this, I immediately felt the pain I described above. The haphazard technique in which the injection was performed was incredibly negligent. 8 March: The soonest appointment I could get. PCM believed the issue to be muscle pain and believed it would resolve in 2-4 weeks. I was prescribed Flexeril and Celebrex. None of which has helped with pain, the Flexeril just puts me to sleep. I am unable to lift more than 5lbs with that arm and do simple things like put on deodorant/T-shirts, etc. without extraordinary pain (as in a more than a 7).  The PCM recommended a nerve test if there was no improvement in 2 weeks.  I believe this is definitely needed, in addition to a review of other medications that can help me with my pain during the day.  22 March: I called with appointment line as my pain is unbearable during the day. I was told the earliest date they had for an in-person would be 1 April. I wrote the PCM via my insurance asking if a nerve study could be done at that time and was told that I need to speak with my provider about that...Is that not what my insurance is meant to do? Due to the pain, I went to the ER and was prescribed an oral steroid and lidocaine patches and told it will take 2-4 months to heal. The 7-day steroids have done nothing for me, but the lidocaine patches are very helpful for pain and help me get me to sleep at night. Unfortunately, I can only use them every 12 hours, so I save them for nighttime.  1 April: PCM at suggested a steroid injection at the end April to help with physical therapy, which she just put in a referral for today (1 April). I asked if she could give it to me now if it helps but she wants to wait to see what the nerve study comes back and says, a referral for the nerve study was put in on 1 April, even though I requested it 22 March. 12/26/1992d I asked the PCM when I could expect the study and she has no idea when the nerve study will take place, but guestimates the end of April as that is when she wants to do the steroid shot. After speaking with neurology, there is no referral in for my test and referral management did not answer their phone when I tried to contact them. I visited info desk, they gave me four numbers for patient advocacy, referral mgmt. and neurology. One is an incorrect number and three of them are operable and, but no one picks up and the system states, ""The mailbox you have reached cannot accept messages"". The shirt gave me a number as well, but it provides the same mailbox message. I finally located the number/email for the patient advocacy on 1 April and informed them I am having an issue with care. As of 7 April, no one has called back.  6 April: Referral for a nerve consult (not test) was put in on 1 April, however no one acted on it. So, I physically went to referral management to see where it was sitting. Neurology had it, but the referral office did not have a number for them, only the consult and appointment line. After locating that office, myself, I was told a consult appointment would happen 30 April at the soonest. I stated that it was unacceptable to wait that long, given my track record of pain and I asked for the number to patient advocacy but was told they do not have it. I called referral management to get an external clinic to provide the test but received the following: ?The mailbox you have reached cannot accept messages.? I then tried the help desk, who gave me the number for the Facility. I was not able to catch the name, but I gave her the summary of my issues. I was returned a call by staff at referral management who said he will work with Agency to get my referral off-base since 30 April is far too long given my level of pain. There is a ?30-day access of care? standard but since I have been trying to receive this care since 22 March that 30 days is exceeded.  7 April: Went back to the ER due to the pain and was prescribed Cymbalta, which I only took for two weeks and then weaned off due to heavy depression.  12 April: EMG test at facility was performed. Test was excruciating, Dr. told me some people go to sleep because they have to lay there for so long (45min) Findings were abnormal but still listed as ?normal?. No comparison test was performed on my right arm to confirm a difference. Also, the test was performed the entire time with a ring on my finger (left arm) which I found out later was not great for accurate results. I was told to look forward to finding something with my MRI.  3 May: Went to with the Physical Therapist to get started as the PCM requested. The Dr. asked me to perform several exercises with a lacrosse ball. Then asked to put my arm above my head, which I could not do. He asked to force it up with my right arm and even though I tried it was not going to happen due to the incredible pain. Follow up visit scheduled 18 May. 7 May: Went to facility for an MRI ? process took 20min and was told the results would be avail in the next 3 business days.  15 May: Still waiting for an MRI review/phone call.",,,,,,,,,N,02/22/2021,02/22/2021,0,X-ray - 08 Mar 21 Nerve Conduction Test - 12 Apr 21 MRI - 07 May 21 Physical Therapy - Began 03 May 21,MIL,,None,None,"Headaches, at times",,,2,05/15/2021,,Y,Y,None

In the days following, the bleeding became very heavy, having me go through a super-sized tampon with a pad every 1 and a half to two hours along with several large blood clots each time changing. On the 15th, I called the on-call nurse for my gynocologist and she said that it might have been from the vaccine and taking birth control, since many patients of hers had called with the same problem. The bleeding continued at this rate all the way until my second dose on April 29th. I saw my primary doctor that day and she tested my hemoglobin, which came up at 10.7, which was slightly anemic. She prescribed an Iron supplement and told me to skip my ""period"" days and go straight to my next pack of birth control when the one I was using was finished. The next day, I experienced severe nausea, diarrhea, chills, fever-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, and extreme fatigue. I went to the Emergency Room, and they gave me about an IV and a half. They said I had extreme dehydration, and was slightly more anemic than when tested the day before.  Following that day, the bleeding was significantly lighter and then stopped for a few days on the following Thursday when I started my new pack of birth control. I had little to no blood for.a couple days, followed by bloody discharge up until Tuesday night, the 11th of May, when the bleeding started again, being about the same amount as a regular period.

She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense ""spot sign"" within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks.

Additional infarct in R pons. Mild edematous changes in brainstem possibly related to previous side to side compression. Major arteries and dural venous sinuses show gross patency based on flow related signal loss. Mild compression on R lateral ventricle with 6 mm leftward persistent midline shift.

Of note, the neuroimaging reported above was also reviewed directly in consultation by Neuroradiology at the Women's Hospital at her home town who confirmed the above findings. Notably, the MRI/A did not satisfy criteria for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, nor was it typical for hypertension-related intracerebral hemorrhage (which tends to be deep in the brain and focal). In summary, the neuroimaging findings were not typical for any of the potential etiologies on the differential diagnosis for lobar hemorrhage, including amyloid angiopathy, hypertensive-related hemorrhage, AVM, masses, venous thrombosis, atherosclerosis/ischemic vascular disease, or vasculitis.

Later that evening, sudden onset of tachycardia and extreme dizziness, so I went to the ER. ER doctor gave me 60mg prednisone followed by another three days at 40mg, and sent me home an hour later after it was clear the rash was responding to the prednisone. Beginning in the afternoon of 4/28/21, I suddenly felt like my body weighed a million pounds and like I had been drugged, like I was excessively relaxed and moving in slow motion, but my HR was high. I saw Dr. the following day, 4/29, when I was still feeling heavy, slow, and sedated. She was concerned about my HR and did an ECG which was normal. Later that night, I woke up in the middle of the night with the opposite sensation, like my body was in a full on fight or flight response for no apparent reason, my heart racing and my blood pumping so forcefully through my veins it was slightly painful. I got up and took my BP and it was 145/75. The next evening I developed chest pain in addition to continued tachycardia so I went back to the ER. The ECG they did was also normal but they did no further testing. The doctor explained what I was experiencing must be a side effect of the prednisone and should go away now that I was off of it. This whole time in addition to tachycardia I had been feeling generally ill, weak, shaky, developed a tremor, nauseous, lost a few pounds. I continued to experience tachycardia and unusual blood pressure fluctuations in the second weak following the vaccination but the nausea, weakness, and tremor subsided. In particular, I have developed orthostatic intolerance, with my HR jumping to 120s upon standing and into the 130s-140s when on my feet for more than a few minutes at a time. During this time I have been unable to work normally and unable to care for my two-year-old daughter. I noticed some improvement in my HR issues beginning 5/5/21 but since then I have still been having good and bad days. I had another episode when I went to see an allergist regarding my vaccine reaction on 5/11/21, and they took my vitals reclined (BP 95/59, HR 110), seated (BP 100/62, HR 126), and standing (BP 102/74, HR 136).

I experienced complete immobility of this arm for 4 days and was unable to do basic activities (i.e. putting a shirt on and off, opening cupboards, driving, etc). My sleep was very poor due to the pain and fear of what this would mean for my life. I went back to the doctor's office where I had received the vaccination for guidance as to what to do next and she gave me an RX to help with sleep, suggested I use Menthol rub for the pain, use anti-inflammatory medication and gave me some static exercises to help support recovery.  She said this type of condition can take 6-9 months to heal. Since I wasn't finding much relief from the extreme pain and my arm mobility continued to be very limited, I sought out a Physical Therapist about a couple weeks after receiving the vaccination. After his initial examination, he described my condition as ""frozen shoulder"" and provided exercises to strengthen the muscles in the shoulder in a way that would work around the vaccination injury and give my arm mobility.  This was very helpful and slowly I found ways to deal better with the pain and began to have better movement of the arm and overall rehabilitation from the injury.  I worked with him for 3 weeks and he gave me exercises that I could continue to do at home for ongoing recovery.  I also sought out a chiropractor during this time, but the arm was too painful for any significant work to be done on it. Finally, I went to a massage therapist who provided therapeutic massage to help ease and relax the tightness in my neck and shoulder from the chronic pain I was experiencing.  This too was helpful as I found myself holding my body so tight as a result of the immense pain.  I have now, about 9 months later, regained almost all mobility with minimal limitations still present.  I can still feel the pain in my shoulder when I touch the injection site area and there are days it aches or I will have a shooting pain with a particular movement.  It can also feel painful at times when I do exercises like push-ups, but I started working weekly with a Physical Therapist again in April 2021 to help stabilize that shoulder joint with more focused exercises.  I last met with the Physical Therapist on May 13th, when he encouraged me to continue the shoulder strengthening exercises at home going forward and to continue these, as the shoulder would likely need this for ongoing stabilization.

I suffered through the night unable to sleep with a pain level of about 6. The next morning the pain reduced to about a 4 as I moved the arm more throughout the day. This same cycle repeated itself over and over for the next week and a half each night the pain grew worse until it was a 9 out of 10 and was so bad it would take my breath away. The next morning I went to urgent care. After urgent care I had 4 months of physical therapy with no relief. I then had a cortisone  Shot into my left shoulder which gave me relief for only a few weeks then the pain returned. My doctor then recommended surgery to fix the problem.

I thought it was strange because I hadn't had that in a long time that I could remember. 4) After taking the vaccine within 2-4 days I noticed pressure in my ears that tended to cumulate to ringing when the pressure got high enough. 5) After a few days there has been no more ringing but there is still pressure, this is particularly in my left ear. 6) Along with the pressure it feels as though fluid runs out of my left ear.  I have used peroxide twice to try and clean my ears since then.  I have not swam since summer or early fall.  This feels slightly similar to an ear infection but different.  Not as painful as much as annoying. 7) I have had both covid and the 2nd dose so I feel as though there is no real need for me to get a 2nd dose.  Most data suggest for recovered covid-19 only 1 dose could possibly be sufficient and I do not see a benefit/risk of receiving a 2nd dose if it could possibly make these symptoms worse, when I have already had a 1st dose along with the virus itself not that long before. 8) Though I have not had any other vaccinations in the past month, in the past year (since June 12 of  2020) I have had the following: 2 doses of Hepatites A, Influenza 0.5 ml, Tetanus depntheria peitussis, Oral typhoid 4 capsules, Vaxchora dose, Menreo , Yellow fevor Sanofi pasteur, Polio sanofi pasteus, A second flu vaccine in October.

Mom notes that he was in his usual state of health when he presented to COVID clinic to get his first vaccine. He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very ""wide eyed"" and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.   He had eaten a full breakfast prior to getting the shot.  He had a normal night sleep and a normal day yesterday per mom.   Medical History: as above  Surgical history: none Family History: Reviewed and no pertinent related family hx pertaining to this visit Social History: Lives with family  Allergies: food allergies  Medications: flovent, epi-pen Immunizations: Up to date  Medical Decision Making  12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.  On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan. He was discharged in a stable condition with mom at side.    **After patient was discharged, cardiology called the follow-up team due to the prolonged QTC to ensure that we were aware.
