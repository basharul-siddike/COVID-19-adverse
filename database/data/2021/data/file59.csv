Three did not recommend that I get the second shot.  I spoke to a HCP  �\_(?)_/�  from a Covid Medical Hotline, and he suggested having an allergy test done to determine whether I am allergic to Polyethelene Glycol, and if so then I would have my answer (do not get the second shot).   I went to an allergist today, and after telling me on the phone that they had the test available, he refused to administer it claiming results are unreliable and that this is still speculation that polyethelene glycol is the cause of anaphalaxyis. Took my money and got me nowhere.   I read a peer reviewed / scholarly / credible research paper that stated that too many antibodies can have a reverse effect. What if I have  antibodies/t cells already from having had Covid, and now the added antibodies from the vaccine are pushing me over that threshold where I'm experiencing adverse effects.  Also important to note -- I am not your average person, I am very petite. In general, I need to take half of the dose that is recommended. See examples my RX doses are lower than normal bc of my body's response. Even for things like advil/tylenol, I take half of the recommended dose. My body is VERY susceptible to medications.  With that in mind, perhaps, one dose of the vaccine  is enough for me.

No Pneumonia, took about 3 months before I felt normal again, and I am a lifelong competitive athlete, marathon runner, competition finisher still at this point in life.   It hit me pretty hard. I am also one of those people who has a pretty hyper-active immune system --  get hit hard once with a virus, but then have seemingly lifelong immunity.  I think this is why my body is buggin out from the vaccine. It remembers, and is also like how did this get in here, we re-calibrated.  I've never had hives prior to that night of the covid shot.

His chest pain was gradual in onset, centrally located, non-exertional, non-positional and without any radiation. The patient had no significant family history of cardiac disease. The ECG showed, ST depression in lead aVL and mild PR depression/ST elevations in lead I. These were new findings compared to a previous ECG. His troponin-I was elevated at 2.24, and his C-reactive protein was elevated at 1.49. No acute cardiopulmonary disease was seen in chest x-ray, and a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted from an outside hospital and the patient was transferred for further treatment of myocarditis. After discharge, the patient was placed on ibuprofen and instructed to follow-up with his primary care physician. At follow-up, he was placed on a 3-month medical profile and made non-deployable. He was to be followed by cardiology as an outpatient. The patient's outcome was not reported in the article.

The additional information received on 04APR2021 included: additional laboratory values, diagnosis and outcome information.  The patient was reported to be a 25-year-old healthy male who received a primary dose of ACAM2000 in April 2018 and was subsequently diagnosed with probable myopericarditis. Symptoms reported included: shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dizziness, chills and fever. Additional significant laboratory findings included HSV 1 (Glycoprotein G Ab IgG): Positive, Epstein Barr Virus Capsid Ab IgG: Positive; Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Ab IgG: Positive. For other tests with negative results please refer to relevant Lab section. The patient received follow-up care with a cardiologist for 6 months and serial cardiac imaging. He was placed on limited duty with no exercise for 6 weeks and a non-deployable status for at least 6 months. He was followed by a cardiologist until complete recovery at between 3 and 9 months.  The authors concluded that there was no significant difference observed between the rate seen and the published rates that occurred during the clinical trials. The available evidence suggested that the 5 cases were not an unexpected elevation in the rate of the disease or condition, but rather a predictable number of myopericarditis cases proportional to the increased number of vaccinations performed during a short period of time.

Ibuprofen and colchicine were continued and he was followed by Cardiology as an outpatient. The patient was then placed on a 6-month medical profile. Approximately 1 month after initial presentation to the ED, the patient returned with 1 day of similar chest pain. He had been compliant with medication and his initial ECG was normal without signs of ST elevation of PR depression. On repeat ECG, he showed non-specific ST changes in leads II, III, and aVL. His troponin-I was within normal limits and a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was normal as well. Due to dynamic changes in ECG and recent history of myopericarditis, the patient was transferred to an outside hospital for further evaluation. The patient's outcome was not reported in the article.  Follow up information was obtained on 04APR2021 during a review of scientific literature:  This is case 1 of 5 reported cases within the article: (cross reference: 21000041LT, 18000140LT, 18000141LT, and 18000143LT).    The additional information received included: additional laboratory values, diagnosis and outcome information.   The patient was reported to be a 27 year old healthy male who received a primary dose of ACAM2000 in April 2018; and was subsequently diagnosed with probable myopericarditis.  Additional symptoms reported included: shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dizziness, chills and fever.  His ECG showed diffuse T wave abnormalities with no pericardial effusion. His significant laboratory findings included  HSV 1 (Glycoprotein G Ab IgG): Positive, Epstein Barr Virus Capsid Ab IgG: Positive; Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Ab IgG: Positive, Adenovirus Aba: Positive, Parvo B19 (IgG/IgM): IgG+/ IgM+, Coxsackie A7, A9, A16, A24 (IgG/IgM): IgG+/IgM+. For other tests with negative results please refer to relevant test section.  The patient received follow-up care with a cardiologist for 6 months and serial cardiac imaging. He was placed on limited duty with no exercise for 6 weeks and a non-deployable status for at least 6 months. He was followed by a cardiologist until complete recovery at between 3 and 9 months.   The authors concluded that there was no significant difference observed between the rate seen at Facility and the published rates that occurred during the clinical trials. The available evidence suggested that the 5 cases were not an unexpected elevation in the rate of the disease or condition, but rather a predictable number of myopericarditis cases proportional to the increased number of vaccinations performed at Facility during a short period of time.

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in a female patient aged between 12-13 months old, who was vaccinated with unspecified hepatitis A vaccine and unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (manufacturer unknown for all) for prophylaxis.  The patient was born to distantly related but healthy parents at 38 weeks of gestation. Her own medical history was remarkable for significant viral illness: at 9 months of age, the patient had a prolonged febrile illness with seizures, triggered by seasonal coronavirus HKU1 (non-COVID-19) infection. At 10 months of age, the patient experienced severe influenza A (H3) pneumonia with very high fever and progressive respiratory failure despite treatment with oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, methylprednisolone and oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannulae. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation for 3 days but recovered. Whole exome sequencing of DNA extracted from whole blood of the proband was performed commercially on the Illumina platform by Invitae Corporation. Carriage of the STAT2 variant by the proband, and all family members, was tested by Sanger sequencing of DNA isolated from whole blood by local diagnostic genetic laboratories according to standard methodologies. Suspecting a genetic aetiology in this case, whole exome sequence analysis and addition/deletion testing of 207 genes associated with primary immunodeficiency was undertaken on whole blood DNA from the proband, identifying a homozygous predicted pathogenic variant in STAT2 (c.1999C less than T [p.Arg667Ter]) and a heterozygous variant in DOCK2 [c.54-1Gless than T], the latter of unlikely clinical relevance. Sanger sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of STAT2 c.1999C less than T in the homozygous state in the proband. This variant was heterozygous in both parents and a clinically unaffected sibling, consistent with segregation of an autosomal recessive trait. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, 6 days before onset of illness, the patient received unspecified measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, unspecified hepatitis A vaccine, unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, varivax (varicella zoster virus) vaccine and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided for all). The age of vaccination was not provided but it could be 12 months or 13 months.

Blood cultures collected on days 4 and 6 and were sterile. High fever continued despite intravenous ceftriaxone for presumed pyelonephritis. The patient was on the Paediatric ward for 2 days with continuing high fever up to 41 degree Celsius. On day 3, the patient was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) because of poor bilateral lower extremity perfusion that failed to improve on multiple fluid boluses. This was accompanied by persistent tachycardia, increased work of breathing, and a diffuse erythematous rash. Extensive imaging revealed no evidence of an infective focus in the renal tract (ultrasonography), chest (repeated plain x-radiography), abdomen/pelvis (contrast CT) or heart (echocardiography). Virology investigations were consistent with human herpes virus type 6 (HHV6) reactivation, based on positive blood PCR (23,500 (log 4.4) copies/ml of HHV-6 type B), positive HHV6 IgG at 1:80 (negative if less than 1:10) and negative IgM (less than 1:20) on day 6. Testing was not undertaken for MMR viruses; samples were not stored to enable retrospective testing. Persistent high fever was accompanied by worsening cytopenias, elevated triglycerides, elevated ferritin to more than or equal to 500 ng/ml, and elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor level. These results met 5 of 8 criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). An attempt at bone marrow aspiration on day 9 of admission was aborted due to apnea and profound desaturation. The patient was quickly resuscitated and returned to baseline within a few hours while hematologic parameters began spontaneously improving by day 10. Fever abated after 15 days and the patient was discharged on no antibiotics. Treatment with corticosteroids and/or other immunomodulators was planned after the bone marrow aspiration, but not administered because of clinical and laboratory evidence suggestive of spontaneous HLH resolution on day 10. The diagnosis was considered to be transient HLH triggered by HHV6 infection. Immediately after hospital discharge the patient developed a diffuse vesicular rash from which varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA was detected by PCR. This occurred 20 days after receiving the varicella vaccine. The patient was treated with acyclovir for 5 days (20 mg/kg every 6 h) without complication. There was no attempt to ascertain by molecular testing whether VZV was the vaccine strain. However the patient had no exposure to individuals with chickenpox or shingles at home or in hospital. Based on molecular typing of rash-associated virus in post-marketing varicella vaccine surveillance in two countries, the timing of this rash was more consistent with vaccine-strain varicella (median onset 17-21 days post-vaccination) than with wild type varicella (median interval: 7-8 days post-vaccination). Thus on a balance of probabilities, the patient likely experienced dissemination of vaccine-strain VZV rather than wild type varicella. At 14 months of age, immunological work up was undertaken which revealed a polyclonal increase in IgG, protective antibody levels against measles, VZV, diphtheria, and tetanus and normal lymphocyte subset analysis. Immunophenotyping results, (patient II:3) showed total lymphocytes was 3,600 (normal range: 1600-6,700), CD3+ CD4+ was 1,008 (normal range: 1,000-4,600), CD3+ CD8+ was 756 (normal range: 400-2,100), CD3 was 1,368 (normal range: 600-2,700), CD19+ CD3- CD56+ was 216 (normal range: 200-1,200), IgG (mg/dL) was 1,170 (normal range: 300-900), IgG1 was 979 mg/dL (normal range: 160-562), IgG2 was 218 mg/dL (normal range: 24-98), IgG3 was 90 mg/dL (normal range: 17-64), IgG4 was 201 mg/dL (normal range: 0-22), IgM was 63 mg/dL (normal range: 15-70), IgA was 40 mg/dL (normal range: 40-160), IgE was 6 IU/ml (normal range: 0.62-1.6), Tetanus IgG was 4.5 IU/ml (normal range: more than 0.1), Diphtheria IgG was 0.8 IU/ml (normal range: more than 0.1), Measles IgG was more than 300 AU/ml (normal range: more than or equal to 30) and VZV IgG was 1033 Index units (normal range: more than or equal to 135). At 14 months of age, the patient had pulmonary consolidation and fever for 4 days associated with rhinovirus/enterovirus. At 15 months of age, the patient had rhinovirus/enterovirus upper respiratory tract infection with fever for 7 days. At 17 months of age, the patient had suppurative otitis media with fever. At 24 months of age, the patient had febrile parainfluenza virus type 3 upper respiratory tract infection. At 25 months of age, the patient had mixed upper respiratory tract infection with parainfluenza virus type 3, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus. At 26 months of age, the patient had upper respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus/enterovirus, with 5 days of fever up to 39.3 degree C and development of lower extremity papular and urticarial rash. Now 3 years of age, her physical growth and developmental milestones had been normal. Further live vaccines had been withheld. Prophylactic immunoglobulin therapy was not felt to be indicated. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization. The author commented, ""This case informs understanding of the function of STAT2 in both antiviral immunity and immunoregulation. STAT2 is unique among human STATs, by virtue of both its narrow spectrum of activity (within IFN-I/III pathways) and its direct participation in both positive and negative regulation. Defining the molecular and clinical consequences of STAT2 variants provides not only clinically relevant information, but also fundamental insight into the involvement of STAT2, and IFNI/III more generally, in human immunity. It should be noted that severe IAV displays incomplete clinical penetrance in patients with mutated TLR3, IRF7, IRF9, or STAT2. This is not unexpected, since in the context of defects of pathogen defence there are multiple factors that likely contribute to variable expressivity, including: variable pathogen exposure, infecting dose, prior vaccination and compensation by adaptive immunity. Disease caused by live-attenuated parenteral viral vaccines continues to serve as a clear signal of compromised IFNAR signaling. Another novel observation in this case is the occurrence of clinical varicella following VZV immunization, which has not previously been described in STAT2 deficiency. The implication is that vaccine-strain VZV may, like other live-attenuated vaccines such as MMR, be effectively controlled by innate IFNs in vivo, consistent with a previous report of VZV dissemination in a child with IRF9 deficiency. Regrettably in our case, molecular analysis was not undertaken at the time of varicella diagnosis to definitively prove the vaccine origin of VZV, nor was material stored to enable retrospective analysis. It is also notable that dissemination of MMR virus was not identified in this case, despite a suggestive temporal association between administration of MMR and the onset of clinical disease. MMR dissemination is strongly associated with defects of IFN-I/III immunity, but is not inevitable. Again, it should be noted that in our case, blood and/or mucosal samples were not analyzed by PCR for MMR viral detection, and no clinical material was available to retrospectively test. Therefore occult MMR viral replication cannot be excluded as a potential contribution to HLH. The capacity of IFN gamma to compensate for antiviral activity in vitro might suggest a potential therapeutic role in controlling viral replication, however this approach may come at a cost of enhancing hyperinflammation. There have been clinical reports of responsiveness to IVIG or steroids, although in our case the hyperinflammation resolved without specific treatment. More work is needed to dissect the pathomechanism and inform therapeutic strategies."" The author concluded, ""In summary, this case significantly expands our clinical understanding of STAT2 deficiency. As the first report of life-threatening IAV in STAT2 deficiency, we can now add STAT2 to the list of genes implicated in this phenotype - a list that increasingly emphasizes the importance of IFN-I/III. We also report the first instance of disseminated vaccine-strain VZV in STAT2-deficiency, suggesting a role for innate IFNs in control of live-attenuated VZV vaccines. Finally, as only the second report of HLH in a patient with STAT2-deficiency, this case strengthens the notion that STAT2-deficient patients are vulnerable to hyperinflammation, motivating further investigation of the underlying mechanism(s) and highlighting the enduring capacity of monogenic diseases to uncover novel areas for scientific exploration.""",,,Y,,Y,,,,Y,,,,"Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1.2 on day 7,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:0.8 on day 8,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:0.8 on day 9,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1.1 on day 10,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:0,2 on day 10,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1.4 on day 11,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:2.4 on day 12,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: absolute neutrophil count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:3.1 on day 15,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:1.5,Normal High:8.5); Test Name: physical examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:showed nasal congestion,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:242,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:144 on day 6,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:127  on day 7,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:107 on day 8,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:85 on day 9,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:85 on day 10,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:101 on day 11,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:135 on day 12,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:534 on day 15,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:150,Normal High:450); Test Name: PCR; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: PCR; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA was detected,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: ferritin test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1980  on day 9,Unit:ng/mL,Normal Low:12,Normal High:207); Test Name: ultrasonography; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:no evidence of an infective focus in renal tract,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: VZV IgG; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1033 Index units,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:1033 Index units); Test Name: viral test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:17.6 on day 4,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:3.5 on day 6,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:2.3 on day 7,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1.4 on day 8,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1.5 on day 9,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:2. 7 on day 10,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:3.5 on day 11,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:5.6 on day 12,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Test Name: white blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:9.1 on day 15,Unit:x10e9/L,Normal Low:6.0,Normal High:17.5); Comments: A partial septic screen yielded more than 100,000 colony forming units/ml of Escherichia coli from urine and a positive PCR for rhinovirus/enterovirus RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab sample.

The pateint was calling because her doctor, who she saw yesterday 14Apr2021, told her she should let Pfizer know what was going on. She had a reaction to the Pfizer Covid19 Vaccine. she was now having PVCs. The patient added that all of the events started with a fever, and throwing up. She had a fever and threw up for 36 hours. She had to contact her physician to get medication and to stop vomiting and the nausea and everything. During that time, she was sick. She was having intermittent breathing issues which she did not think she felt too much of until after the other sickness was over. She was weak, like people get after they are sick, and had bizarre shaking legs and arms which was strange. She added that she had breathing issues and difficulty breathing and hard to get a breath. That was what she was dealing with. Treatment: caller took Pedialyte and all the proper things to get back into better shape. The breathing issue still remained. The doctor called in a rescue inhaler. She kept going downhill so he called in a rescue inhaler. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Caller added that this one will not be believed but on Monday, she woke up and got dressed again and was just weak and had breathing issues but was just doing work on the laptop. She did not fall, she did not run into anything. In the evening, she went to take a bath and saw that when she took her clothes off there was a large black bruise on her left breast, it was probably 2 inches in diameter. It is very large, but does not hurt like a bruise. She checked the rest of her body for blood issues and only saw a couple normal looking bruises. She contacted her doctor, and they questioned her thoroughly on her bruising and activity. This was on Monday. Tuesday, she still felt the same headache, weak, and breathing issues. PVCs (Ventricular premature beat) after second vaccine: Yesterday, 14Apr2021, she started declining and the doctor wanted to see her. Caller stated the doctor heard PVCs in her heart. Caller asked clarification of PVC abbreviation and does not provide. She never had heart issues ever. The doctor did blood work and a chest x-ray, and saw the bruise and was worried about her blood. Caller added that even though these are not listed as side effects of the vaccine, she was worried. Her doctor sent her to a facility for chest x-rays to make sure there is no pulmonary embolism. Caller confirmed this was on 14Apr2021. She has not yet heard back. PVCs after second vaccine: Caller added the doctor said her lungs sounded good but wanted to see what was going on to see how her breathing was because there was difficulty. The doctor wanted to cover bases and check. Today, caller can tell her heart is still not in correct rhythm and that it is in continued PVCs. She still had the same breathing issues, limbs were weak, she was shaky, and she is lightheaded. She was hoping to wake up today and feel better. Fever after second vaccine: started 3am 08Apr2021. She had a fever and was throwing up at this time. Throwing up and nausea after second vaccine: caller add that throwing up and vomiting with nausea occurred at 3 am, all of this occurred 08APR2021. The vomiting lasted 36 hours, and it ended when she took medication. The fever lasted 40 hours. Even after the medication worked for her fever, she had nausea. Around Friday was when it went away. Intermittent breathing issues after second vaccine: caller adds it started with throwing up and fever, but she did not think a lot about this or know when it started because she was dealing with the fever and vomiting. It continued, and it has not subsided or ended. As a matter of fact, there are 2 or 3 times it has gotten bad which is why she was given an inhaler. Treatments: caller took a Phenergan suppository, which she adds is the best medicine in the World for nausea and beats Zofran. She had used two or three doses and it did work. She used a rescue inhaler, Albuterol Sulfate HFA. She took Tylenol for fever. She is also now taking an aspirin daily because of the blood issues. No additional information regarding the products. Weak after second vaccine: caller adds that this started at the same time, she was over the nausea and noticed this. It felt different than what it feels like with the flu. This is still going on, she did not think too much about it but it has persisted. Sometimes there is a little bit of shaking but that is intermittent. Caller states she can not put it into words. Bizarre shaking legs and arms after second vaccine: this goes with the weakness, she is continually weak but she has a shaky feeling that will come every now and then and is random. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Monday this started, 12APR2021 and it is still there but it is the same. It has not been sore like a bruise but it is black and large. The physician has seen it now and it is bizarre and scary. It is the left breast on the outside.  Headache after second vaccine: started probably an hour after the vaccine, pretty quick. There were degrees to this headache because it was an actual migraine for a good 48 hours and even after the fever was gone it was terrible. It started out just a mild headache and then was very severe for a couple of days. Then, after that it was just there but not as severe. PVCs after second vaccine: caller adds that she went to the doctor yesterday 14APR2021 and she can tell every now and again that she is having these but there is nothing she can do about it. Caller adds this is everything new she can think of, but some of it is foggy, she thinks this is the main information. Brain fog after first and second vaccine: Caller then states, by the way, after both vaccines within 2 or 3 minutes of having them her head started feeling foggy and weird.  Investigations: caller has not received any results yet. She did get an EKG, Chest XRAY, blood work, and the doctor also rattled off a bunch of things the doctor was going to check. These all were on 14Apr2021 and she is waiting on results. Caller confirms the physician told her she had PVCs while listening to caller's heart. Did any AE require a visit to: Physician office? 15Apr2021 she was in contact with her physician, and the whole week they were on the phone. Yesterday 14Apr2021 the physician wanted to see her. The doctor figured out something was going on with her heart so thankfully the doctor wanted to see her. It was discussed if caller should go to the ER but caller did everything she could not to go because that is the last place she wants to go. Emergency Room: no.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett's esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn't heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn't had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn't sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn't care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person's system and that maybe is why she didn't have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.

A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraine (diagnosed about 30 years ago), low hypotension, allergic to strawberries, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Concomitant medications included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease, sumatriptan taken for migraine and naproxen taken for migraine; start and stop dates were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 first dose on 09Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced four days after his second shot (06Mar2021), his migraines got more pronounced than normal which they expected, but then the migraines got so severe that it had occurred every single day. The reporter seriousness for migraine was medically significant. Migraine was reported as worsened. The caller stated that she was a registered nurse as well, she was calling about the Pfizer Covid vaccine. She spoke with the CDC on Saturday. Her fiance, he has a history of getting migraines for like the past 33 years. After the first dose on 09Feb2021, he then had the second on 02Mar2021. 4 days after the second dose, he got a migraine headache that was more severe than his usual and then it went away, then the next day after, he got another migraine headache, and he has been getting them everyday since then. He gets the headache once a day, for like a 12 hour duration then 8. Made attempt to clarify with the caller, she stated that for the 30 something years his migraines would occur once a week or twice a month, but now after the second dose it was daily. Currently the span of the migraine headache was shorter, it has gone from 12 hours to 8 hours. He was on sumatriptan and naproxen for his migraines, but now it takes the medication 1.5 hours to make the headache go away. They did a CAT scan and the result was normal. Both the first and second dose took place in the morning at 10AM or 10:30AM. After the second vaccine on 02Mar2021, his first migraine was on Saturday 06Mar2021. After stating his age, she stated that he's not old like the typical 73 year old. He sees a doctor at the VA for primary care and also has another primary care doctor outside of the VA. He has seen both for the migraines, caller stated that she would like to skip this section as her fiance was not there right now and doesn't know if he wanted to provide that. Migraine, it's usually on the right side of the head, in the temple, eye, cheek bone area, as well as a little bit around the hairline area. It was now every 8 hours a day, that he experiences the migraine for and it's getting worse and worse. Seriousness criteria: his medication before would take half hour, but now it's taking hour to hour and a half. His migraines were so severe that she recalls one time being in the car with him, and he actually has to hold the left side of his face, and put his head down. His primary doctor gave a shot called Aimovig and she guesses it takes a while to start working, it can take a couple weeks, it was suppose to be a preventative medication but it hasn't done anything yet, it hasn't kicked in yet. An as ER nurse for 30 years, she can tell his level of pain was more than 10 on a pain scale. Lot number was unknown, the vaccine card was physically with her fiance, she does not have it at this moment. When queried anatomical location of vaccine, sounding unsure she stated that he got one on the right arm and one on the left arm. Caller stated that she will try calling him on the other phone and see if he can answer, he carries the vaccine card with him. Causality was related, because this started 4 days after the second shot and has not stopped. It's not like a typical migraine. He takes a medication on and off for GERD called omeprazole. He was diagnosed with low hypotension, they put him on metoprolol but the doctor said that he might as well not take it since his blood pressure goes low. The CAT scan was normal and was done 2 weeks ago at the end Mar2021. He gets blood work every 6 month, the last one was a couple months ago and it was fine. Lot and expiry for sumatriptan, naproxen, and Aimovig were unknown, they were not physically with her at the moment. Facility of vaccine administration: it's not a military facility, it's a grocery store with pharmacy inside. He has not had to go to the ER. He did have a physician appointment however, he did not specifically see the doctors for the migraine, it was an appointment that was already annually schedule as he see's the doctor every 6 months. At the doctor's appoint he did tell (name) how bad the migraines were. He was really highly ranked in the military so his pain tolerance was pretty high, to see him double over with headache was unbelievable. He has had no other vaccines on the same day or in the 4 week period prior getting the Covid vaccine. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. Treatment was Aimovig injection, it's a once a month injection, but she understood that it can take up to weeks for it to actually work. As an ER nurse, she has seen people with a headache and say their pain level was 10 but you know it's not, but in her fiance's case it was definitely 10+, they were also closer together in frequency and it worries her. At the end of the call, she asked that his doctor at VA mentioned the vaccines works with the immune system and can cause inflammation, caller asked if this was true. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

She was trying to figure out if it was safe to her to get the second dose of the covid vaccine next week. Itchiness all over her body: The only place she did not itch was her hands and feet. Her scalp, back and everything itched. She mostly itched on her torso and scalp. She even itched inside of her ears. She does not take any medications. She was healthy. She has no known drug allergies. She has not started any new products. She kept going about her business, but the itching was getting worse and worse until this weekend.

Benadryl children's dose did not help at all. All of a sudden, the itching resolved on Saturday, 10Apr2021. She was out a lot in the sun all day Saturday. The sun seemed to help, she does not know if it was related. She did not have any hives. It felt like chicken pox to her but with no pustules. The itchiness all over her body was awful. She does not know. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. Her concern was if she had a mild reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, what was going to be like whenever she goes next week for her second dose of the covid vaccine. She was asking if it will be really bad. She was itching so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She took Benadryl children's dose and it did not help the itching. Event itching was reported as serious, medically significant. After reviewing call recording, patient reported when she was at the vaccine facility nothing really major happened, she had a little bit of a weird taste in her mouth, nothing strange. She did get a little bit dizzy but nothing that did not wear off shortly thereafter, so she went about her life normally. The weird taste and dizzy feeling started within minutes of receiving the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. She was lucky enough to work with doctors, so she just talked to them. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

Medical history included ongoing laryngopharyngeal reflux diagnosed about 5 years ago, ongoing anxiety, usually happens during stressful circumstances; diagnosed about 20 years ago and she had had the sensation of labored breathing, dry mouth, and accelerated heart rate then yes for work like with public speaking; sensitive: Sulfa drugs, aesthetic filler in her face and allergic reaction Hyaluronic acid filler collagen and she doesn't smoke and drink. Family history included daughter was diagnosed with psychotic episode and diagnosed with mental illness and it was stressful getting that under control and she was sensitive to medication and surgical procedures she doesn't tolerate narcotics. Concomitant medication included clonazepam (KLONOPIN). She reported that she was prescribed .125 of clonazepam and it was a dissolvable sublingual and she doesn't use it frequently as she has read about reliance and potentially addictive and she will take a walk or watch a boring video to try to get her mind off it. The patient previously took oxycodone hydrochloride; oxycodone terephthalate; paracetamol (PERCOCET) and she was sensitive to Percocet; and darvocet and experienced sensitive to Darvocet post surgery; and codeine, and vicodin and was sensitive to both drugs, advil and causes her stomach to be upset, shingles vaccine, HPV vaccine, chicken pox vaccine and got 1 pox from that about 15 years ago when it first came out. The only post-surgical medicine pain reliever she can take was Tramadol and more often than not she doesn't have to do anything beyond Tylenol extra strength. On 24Mar2021, 04:00, the patient experienced extreme chills, and anxiety accompanied with tight, shallow, and labored breathing. She had troubled breathing due to this. She mentioned that she went to the emergency room (ER) that morning. On 27Mar2021, the patient had emphysema and agitation. On 26Mar2021, early in the morning, she had the breathing issue that she mentioned first concurrent with agitation and anxiety like at same time with the extreme chills. The sensation of agitation was all combined together, it like hit out of the blue while she was getting ready to go to sleep. She stated that at 4am it hit her with a sudden bout of extreme chills and at the same time a sense of anxiety, it felt like she hit a wall and couldn't get a full breath. She stays up late but wasn't doing anything anxiety provoking, she thought she was reading recipes. She sat to calm herself as she was not sure if it was a reaction or anxiety at the initial reaction fueling it further so she tried to sort of lower everything in her system and was concerned it could accelerate and not subside. At the hospital, they took her in an exam room and did her vitals and she was there about 2-3 hours and it was early in the morning and at that point sometime they took a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work and at that point prior to that while she was waiting she was feeling a little better, the worst had subsided and she suggested she go and they asked her to stay since she was already checked in and to be seen. The doctor looked at the results and read the film and questioned about emphysema and she felt that was unrealistic reading as she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink and it's not in her genetic make up. The doctor told her lungs were showing a lot of air and she said maybe it was because she was gasping and they told her to take a big gulp of a breath and hold it to get the X-ray. The doctor suggested she see a pulmonologist and she didn't feel that was warranted. She contacted her general practitioner and they recommended she get the 2nd shot and had her see an allergist who also suggested she get the 2nd shot. The patient stated that she was not really overweight and doesn't drink and doesn't smoke and the allergist didn't mention but she saw in the paperwork that a side effect could be difficulty breathing. She had no swelling, body rash, dizziness or weakness. Since that episode, she periodically throughout the day, and she can't tell if it's anxiety or allergies or something but she felt labored breathing and tightness in her chest and can't get a full intake of breath. She reported that when she sleeps on her back the sensation disappears completely and when she sleeps on her side it reappears a little; 1-2 nights after, it woke her from sleep and she doesn't think she was dreaming about anxiety. She stated that she has never had anaphylactic if this should escalate what to do and she decided to go to the ER and they had her wait an additional 2 hours for a follow-up reading that was all clear, all fine, except emphysema thing which was again, she was just researching and forgot the medical term, she this it was hype aeration, too much air sucked in. Her general practitioner recommended she see an allergist for a 2nd opinion and was surprised she was up on anything and didn't mention side effect and the handout said it could be a possible side effect. She has to yawn a lotto get the air in. She does have laryngopharyngeal reflux prior and she clears her throat which is probably annoying and controls that through diet instead of taking Pepcid AC. She has had to clear her throat a lot but never had labored breathing or shortness of breath, that to get a full breath sometimes she has to yawn to get past that tightness of shallow breathing or labored breathing. On certain days she doesn't feel it and thinks it was done and she will have a spate and it happens and she thought there was something stressing and does a reality check and again it's that time of year and when she was taking her walk and walked past a certain block she started to wheeze from the pollen on an unspecified date and she called her allergist to see about getting something. She had a mask and that helped a little. Her allergies were not exacerbating on 23Mar2021 or 26Mar2021 but started the last few days and she has a wheezing cough that had an extended sort of wheeze at the end of the cough. Before her cough for LPR it was annoying throat clearing. After the vaccine, she took that walk through that one specific spot on her route she got to coughing and thinking she needs to call and get something prescribed something if anything if she gets the second shot it will address any of the side issues if they were related to allergies so don't have to contend. It was every night where she sort of feels it and she sleeps through the night so if it was tension related it subsides and can't distinguish what is emotional and physical but she was sleeping through the night and it was an indication that it was improving. She reported that when she visited her son and after she returned he told her he was unaware he had strep and didn't know it, he was asymptomatic and she had a sore throat and went to urgent care and had an exam and didn't have strep and doesn't know what it was but she was feeling better by the weekend. She was supposed to go back and everything was shutting and she didn't go. Maybe she was exposed and just had a mild thing while she was there. She was tested for Covid on 26Mar2021 and her result was negative, but they did not do an antibody test. She wanted to know if difficulty breathing was a common reaction with the vaccine, and if the side effects would be lesser after the 2nd dose since she already had a severe reaction after the 1st dose and if she should still receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine. She was concerned the 2nd shot will be more pronounced than the 1st and she doesn't want to go through that and it be more severe.  She has heard if you had that reaction you may have been exposed to Covid before and she may have been around people with Covid that had positives and she may have antibodies from an asymptomatic experience and it may do more harm than good and she should do the 2nd shot. She mentioned this to her allergist and was told if she has a similar symptoms to call and get a bronchodilator. She was onboard with that but wants to discuss it because she finds it hard to believe she was the only one that had difficulty breathing and was wondering what was the duration of this labored breathing. She was scheduled for the second dose 18Apr2021.

The patient's historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he's up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It's the same and it's just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he's got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it's persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that's when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that's a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn't hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that's what he thinks it's called, it's just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn't hear but didn't pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn't worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn't find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI's and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that's why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn't find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI's, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn't remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that's when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn't painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there's a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it's a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it's not painful, it's healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn't tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization.

Within 30sec-1min I started feeling pressure wave slowly spreading from my right arm and traveling to my right shoulder blade and neck. Within few minutes I developed neck pain like I pulled a muscle on my right side. 1-2min later I started having muted hearing in my right ear and felt heaviness on my head. within 10-20mins my left ear was impacted as well. (hearing issues lasted about 30mins-1hr). Also, within first 10-15 minutes my face felt swollen and heavy, but it was not visually swollen. Once I took my mask off in the car, I had red/pink marbled rash on my skin on the area that the mask was covering. I haven't had any face rash from this mask before.  I asked the vaccine site staff if the back and neck symptoms are normal, she gave me a blank stare and nodded her head. Additionally, after first 10 minutes my left thigh muscle started cramping and involuntarily moving for a few minutes, quickly followed by feeling of pulling nerve in my right thigh. That lasted around a minute and suddenly moved upwards and hit my back with sharp pain like radiculitis. Every slight change of move felt like sharp sting. I was still in the recovery area, but I had trouble staying in the sitting position. We went home and back pain developed into crippling pain within 30 mins-1hr after the shot. I could do less and less. By 1 hr I was only able to lay flat in my bed, unable to sit. Bending over would not be possible because of tightness and sharp pain. I spent the next day in bed and barely tiptoed to the bathroom when needed, holding onto the furniture and walls. It has been more than 48 hours and I still can't bend or wash my hands.

My arm was sore to the touch and in the late afternoon i noticed i had a mild rash across the back of my arm  starting below my deltoid muscle and spread out and down close to my elbow.  It was not a bright red but the area was remarkably sensitive, so much so that i felt i should report the reaction because ive never had a noticeable reaction to a vaccine so i became mildly alarmed.   I put no creams on the rash nor did i take additional meds.

She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She's never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.

For background, my cardiac history is important. I had a work-up for palpitations performed more than a year ago that revealed normal cardiac function (EF > 65% by NM myocardial perfusion study), normal coronary arteries, and significant exercise tolerance (I maxed out the treadmill test).  Usuallly I have to engage in vigorous exercise to raise my heart rate > 160 bpm. My resting heart rate is typically in the 50s or less.   On Jan 15, 2021 I had an elective cerebral angiography and embolization procedure performed. I was asymptomatic prior to this procedure.  The procedure requires general anesthesia for several hours.  I have had the procedure conducted a few months previously and it typically has an unremarkable recovery, one night required in the hospital.   After the procedure and following extubation, I had hypoxia on room air, tachycardia, wheezing and fatigue.  The working cause for this was suspected atelectasis due to general anesthesia and I was given bronchodilators.  While my breathing improved overnight, I was very tachycardic even while sleeping ? pulse greater than 130.  Overnight telemetry noted arrhythmias with sinus tachycardia.   The tachycardia persisted long after prior albuterol use so I had CTA chest on 1/16.  No PTE was noted, though some basilar atelectasis and mild upper lobe ground glass opacities.  I was discharged but due to continued mild hypoxia overnight, low grade fever (< 101F), and persistent tachycardia with any movement, I went to the ED on 1/17 for additional evaluation.   In the ED, I had tachycardia with arrhythmias noted (rate up to 160). Sinoatrial exit block noted on EKG and telemetry.  COVID-19 testing was negative by nasopharyngeal PCR and antigen testing.  Resting heart rate was > 90 even when sleeping.   Follow-up echocardiogram on 1/21/21 revealed depressed ejection fraction (40-45%).  Cardia MRI on 2/1 was performed to evaluate for cardiomyopathy.  Symptoms at this point were fatigue, dyspnea with even mild activity (e.g. walking), and tachycardia  > 140 bpm with even just walking.  My resting heart rate improved to 40s-50s.  It showed normal wall motion and ventricle size with slightly reduced ejection fraction. Cardiology recommended cardiac event monitoring which I wore for 28 days. It only revealed sinus tachycardia and bradycardia.   I still don?t feel great but able to do more physically than a couple of months ago.  I await further f/u cardiac imaging to see if there has been improvement in the heart function.",,,,,,,,,N,01/10/2021,01/15/2021,5,"Summary of Testing:  1/16/21 ?

Immediately ceased Cipro (prescribed in the ER for a prospective UTI) after only four days of a ten day regimen due to possibility it was a side effect. Received the second vaccine on schedule despite symptoms.  Condition progressed to include tinging in both feet, then both legs started ""falling asleep.""  Sensations are never the same from one day to the next - changing from tingling to pins and needles to numbness/falling asleep to twitching to compression. Cannot track a pattern as to which limbs fall asleep when and for how long (is it positional, food/drink related, is there a specific length of time, symmetrical, etc) but it's systemic, diffuse and bilateral. On the date of the filing of this report (April 27, 2021), I have experienced a 50-75% decrease in the intensity and frequency of the symptoms but they have not yet completely resolved. It is 6 1/2 weeks since my first dose, 3 1/2 weeks since my second.  No presence of any other neurological symptoms - no weakness, no loss of sensation (even with feeling of numbness), no loss of strength, no cognitive impairment, no falling, no blurry vision. No pain.  No indications of any nerve damage whatsoever, so it seems to be uncomfortable and annoying but not dangerous.  Saw a neurologist six days after onset of symptoms and he ran several tests (listed below). While I understand it is impossible to track whether this is definitively vaccine-related, especially with an adjacent emergency room visit, the timing seemed too coincidental to completely dismiss as a possibility. I have not had any neurological symptoms prior to this point in time, and they seem to be dissipating over time without any intervention. I file this report with the hopes that with this new vaccine, any information is helpful and if there is a chance this is a rare severe side effect, perhaps others have reported the same and risk factors can be tracked.",,,,,,,,,N,03/12/2021,03/26/2021,14,MRI of cervical spine - April 6 - NORMAL Bloodwork - April 8 - no sign of any previously unknown conditions EMG - April 26 - NORMAL - no sign of any nerve damage,PUB,,"Prescriptions - Pentasa (4g daily), Klonopin (.05mg only as needed), Cipro Supplements - daily multivitamin",Stomach virus of unknown origin that resulted in ER visit for IV fluids a week after the the first vaccination (symptoms started PRE-vaccine).

1264591,04/27/2021,WA,26.0,26,,F,,"Shot received at 7pm on the 23rd (Fri). I felt a little giddy, likely due to the emotional impact of excitement for treatment (this happened to me with my first shot, and both times with my partner). Experienced what I felt was like feeling mentally a little 'out of it' a few hours in, maybe late that night 10-12pm. I did not have notable physical symptoms until exactly 12 hours after injection. Around 7-8AM I was woken up with body aches. I spent most of that day (Sat) taking ibuprofen and hydrating a lot. I had a small fever that peaked at 100.00 F after chills, etc, once this broke I mostly felt better. Sunday I had some minor aches. It is now Tuesday and here is the reason I am writing this report: I have had very low appetite since getting the shot, but I have pre-existing GI issues. This also happened on the first shot. Both times I have also had slight lymph swelling (mostly on first shot, and it was on the side of my body where injection was given, notably in the armpit, but possibly groin or shoulder). The only thing that has honestly caused me concern is my mental health: I have pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses and some extenuating circumstances (recent death in the family, needing to travel, job loss, pandemic, on top of major depression and PTSD) however I felt that my threshold for coping with day to day stuff has been blunted since getting the vaccine. It is manageable and I do think that it will go away as it did with the first shot. I felt like the last few days have been akin to ""PMSing"", ie; irritable, crying a lot. Contextually, there are reasons for me to be having emotional fluctuations, but I have therapy and have been off/on medications safely and usually have this fairly under control. The reason it was bothering me is I felt that if this happened to other people who had less support or managed diagnoses or other circumstances, it could be worse for them. My partner (who is BP2) has also felt a little more emotionally unstable than usual. We do not think this is from the psychological toll solely of vaccination, the pandemic, or reopening, as it seems to be unrelated to this. Sure, this is anecdotal, but I think it may be important, especially in the event of someone who could have psychotic or mood swing issues (ie: BP1 or schizophrenia, etc). Again, anecdotal, but on some online forums a lot of people have reported having similar mood instability when theirs was otherwise manageable (and these were people who were pro-vax, pro-science, etc). I am worried that if there is not a warning in the future, more people could pre-emptively have mental health adverse effects and not know why. I think it is very seriously from the vaccine. For me this mostly included appetite issues, insomnia (especially the night after I got the shot), crying more, irritability, feeling kind of ""flat"", etc. Perhaps this is just due to the body fighting and doing it's job. I felt however it would be irresponsible of me not to report it.  I have spoken with my mental health provider about this and do not find that I need further treatment but that I wanted them to know, and that I wanted to file a VAERS report additionally to help the study of the vaccine in case this happens to others.",,,,,,,,,U,04/23/2021,04/23/2021,0,N/A,PHM,,"Levocetirizine 5mg, Vit D (2000 iU) , Vit B12, Vit C",,"PTSD, major depression, general anxiety, essential tremor, IBS",,,2,04/27/2021,,,,N/A

Again, I stopped, washed, and took benadryl. Later I played it safe and ate chicken with rice.

However, I also experienced other symptoms.  Starting on the third day, I experienced headache, neckache, and a more painful lower back and left hip than I've felt in decades � to the point that I could barely walk.  I had been in a bicycle accident when I was 14, resulting in a concussion, a cracked lumber vertebra, and damage to my coccyx so severe that it was removed two years later.  I've had a weak left hip ever since.  However, since that accident, I've had regular chiropractic treatment, and, in the last 20 years, clinical massage treatments.  As a result, my spine has stayed healthy and I've led a normal, active life.  It was therefore a complete shock when those old symptoms returned after the Pfizer second shot.  Although they've improved with chiropractic and massage treatments, after 6 weeks I'm still not able to walk very far due to the pain.

1265560,04/27/2021,,29.0,29,,F,,My menstrual cycle  was late by 2 weeks and I had the most *severe* cramping of my life. It began at 5:00 am with low to moderate levels of cramping. By 6:30 am I was fully awake and waiting for the local CVS to open at 8 am so I could purchase ibruprofen. (I NEVER have to take ibruprofen due to cramping).  I ate food before I took 200 mg - an hour later my symptoms had progressed to include doubling over in pain and nausea at which I ate a little more food and took 400 mg more (total 600 mg). At 600 mgs my symptoms abated enough for me to eat a small breakfast (10 am). 4 hours later the nausea and severve doubling over with pain cramps returned which is when I ate more food at took another 600 mgs of ibruprofen.  I went to bed at 7pm that night (usual bed time is 9:30)  I used ibruprofen to manage my symptoms all that first day ? the next day I was exhausted from feeling so beat up the day before but thankfully no more cramping or nausea. Today is day 3 and I am feeling back to myself.   I would just like to reiterate that I have NEVER in my life had a period this severe in cramping or nausea.,,,,,,,,,Y,03/17/2021,04/25/2021,39,,SCH,,OTC tylenol severe cold and flu to manage symptoms post vaccination,None,Seasonal allergies (since age 7) Colitis (diagnosed May 2015),,,2,04/27/2021,,,,Amoxicillin  Augmenten Penicillins Sulfa drugs

This occurred a couple of days after he received his COVID shot.  Therefore, that is probably what is being blamed at this point.  He did have an equivocal EBV testing, but negative parvo.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: CER230) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The medical history included flu and suspected COVID-19 both in Jan2020 to an unspecified date (she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID because it was such a bad flu, over a year ago), ongoing asthma from an unspecified date (mild asthma) and chest nausea in Jan2020 to an unspecified date. The patient had no history of any adverse events following prior vaccinations. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event included an uncle that had asthma, but no one else had breathing issues. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), both ongoing and taken for asthma on unspecified dates. Other products were also reported as ""no"". The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine and did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine.

On 24Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and headache; on 25Mar2021 the patient experienced flu-like symptoms, fever, achy, fatigue; on 02Apr2021 the patient experienced asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest, nausea feeling in her chest; on unspecified dates in Apr2021 the patient experienced she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia. The reporter classified the events headache and flu-like symptoms as non-serious. The patient called to report that she had an asthma flare up 10 days (as reported) after her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 24Mar2021. The patient stated that she did not get a flare up often, she had mild asthma. She usually got mild flare-ups since she did not have severe asthma. She stated it could be something else, but she had not had a flare-up like this since she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID-19 because it was such a bad flu. That was over a year ago. She received her second vaccine on 24Mar2021, and the asthma flare up and hacking cough started on 02Apr2021. On the night of 24Mar2021, she started with a headache. She had the shot at 11 something and by that evening before she went to bed, she had a headache and a sore arm, but that was no big deal. Then on 25Mar2021, she started with flu like symptoms/fever. The headache persisted through that as well. At that point, she did not have tightness or the dry, hacky cough. By the middle of the day on 27Mar2021, her flu-like symptoms were gone. She would consider these to be ""non-serious"", it was what she expected, as it was seen from the paperwork of the vaccine. By 28Mar2021, all of her symptoms were gone prior to the flare-up. She had typical flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, achy, fatigue on the 2nd, 3rd, and into the 4th day but then they cleared up. By the evening of the 4th day, she started feeling fairly normal. She stated that they were mild flu symptoms. Her temperature was only 100 for about a day. She stated that that was expected. Then, she went into this flare-up about the 10th day after the vaccine. The first 3 or 4 days after the flare up began, the flare up was worsening. Then, she got it under a little bit of control, so she was not coughing all night and having to sit up as she was sleeping. Now, she was concerned about the pain and tightness in her chest and the hacky cough. She wanted to make sure it was not going into like a viral pneumonia or another thing. She did not know. She kept increasing her Advair use and was at the top of that. She was doing the duoneb which she did not usually have to do. She had not had to do that since Jan2020 when she had the 5-week flu, or it could have been COVID (they were calling it a hoax back then). She was using her duoneb 4 times a day and now she was using it to 2-3 times, but she was still getting chest tightness, hacky cough. It was kind of like nausea- it was hard to explain, it was kind of like a chest nausea, which she had also had back in Jan2020 when she had the bad flu. She also would get this laryngitis and had trouble talking. With her flare-up, her chest tightness/nausea feeling in the chest continued. Now, she was getting into laryngitis type of thing, but she could loosen that up with her duoneb but if she got to the point where she could not do that, she would definitely have to see someone right away. She clarified that when her chest got tight, the dry, hacky cough continued/increased. When she did the breathing treatment, it loosened it up for about 3-4 hours and some of the pain would go away in her chest. If she talked too much, she would begin to cough. She had had this flare up 3 times in her life, it was not very common. She was diagnosed with asthma in her 40s, and this was her 3rd time ever having anything like this. This was the first time she had experienced a flare up like this. She had had 3 episodes since she had had asthma in her 40's and all 3 bad episodes were about the same. All the episodes were related to illness, it did not just happen out of the blue. It happened with a viral respiratory thing or the flu. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient stated that she would call her physician or the clinic ""today or tomorrow"". She had not been to a doctor since her asthma flared up. Her respiratory doctor/pulmonologist moved away, there was no respiratory doctor nearby right now. So, her general practitioner was following her because it was a mild case and she had mild asthma. If it was severe, her doctor would make her go to a specialist. Relevant tests were reported as no. The patient used to be followed with pulmonary function tests until her respiratory doctor moved away. The patient stated that she took care of her 94 year old mother several days a week and because of all of the variances coming out, she thought it was her civic duty to prevent it from spreading through the population and creating more variances which was why she received the vaccine. She stated her doses were scheduled a month apart because they expecting to get a shipment of Moderna and they did not. They had to run to Buffalo to get the Pfizer vaccine, but they left her doses scheduled a month apart because the appointments were so hard to get. Normally, it would be 3 weeks. Her card clearly said Pfizer and they told her Pfizer, and they told her the reason for it being scheduled at 4 weeks. The patient called to inquire whether asthma flare-ups had been seen in clinical trials. It was not a reported side effect from the paperwork she received. When she looked online, she could not really find anything. She was thinking of going to a clinic but was wondering if there were any reports of flare-ups with asthma with the vaccine. With regards to causality, the patient stated it was a concern because she usually did not get a flare-up unless she was sick. She stated that there were many variables, and that it was spring, and bugs were out, but she did not usually get a flare-up like this. She stated that maybe it was a challenge to her immune system, the antibodies, but she did not know. She suspected the flare-up was related to the vaccine, but she did not have any idea. She would say yes, but she had no way of knowing. The flare-up usually only appeared if she got ill or something weird happened to her.  The clinical outcomes of the events flu-like symptoms, fever, achy and fatigue were recovered/resolved on 27Mar2021; sore arm and headache were recovered/resolved on 28Mar2021; asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were not recovered/not resolved; she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia were unknown. The reporter believed there was a reasonable possibility that the events sore arm, flu-like symptoms, asthma flare-up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were related to BNT162B2.   No follow-up attempts are needed.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children's allergy medication. She took half of a children's dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother's sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother's sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn't feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn't do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn't want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after.

Medical history included cholesterol (abnormal), little light headed and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken as Blood thinner and placed on aspirin for the last 4 years at least, if not more; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and initially he stated he started Atorvastatin 6-12 years ago but then states the medication for cholesterol was started within the last 3-4 years; ongoing lisinopril for little light headed when he was doing physical therapy, like when he would get up real quick, but now his doctor has him back on it; ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) taking it for 20 or 30 years, tocopherol (VITAMIN E), vitamin d nos and a multivitamin in which he started taking at age 50 and mentioned the bottle saying NON-GMO, gluten free, and has a breakdown of everything. On 05Apr2021, the patient was tested positive for covid. The health department said he was clear of that now. He had 2 tests done for Covid. He had the first rocket testing 05Apr2021. The patient reported that he takes medications, but he doesn't think it affected anything or gave him Covid. As of Thursday, 08Apr2021, he got the monoclonal antibody treatment via IV. His symptoms were pretty mild. Just a heavy chest, his coughing was not persistent by any means. Once in a while he will cough and he will expel something/discharge so he imagines there was still some lingering effect or remnants thereof. He really didn't think he had COVID that bad. He had fever for the first 2 days. So, it was hard to say if something was lingering. He had slight fatigue but doesn't feel overly tired, but he was not doing anything physical. He just has a little bit of a cough. He didn't feel the heavy chest much at all. He was worried about the respiratory part. He never felt that he was wheezing. Towards the tail end, he felt like something was there a little bit of congestion possibly. People say he sounded 100% better on the phone he doesn't sound nasally or stuffed. His heavy chest is nothing as it has been in the past. He was worried about getting Covid because of the respiratory problems. It started about the 5th day. if at all. It's hard to say when the ""heavy chest"" began because it's hard to say it really was there. It is the only thing lingering and that has him paying attention to it. He doesn't know if his chest really feels all that heavy, but he knows the more he can get out/expel, the freer his lungs will be. He tries to pay attention to it to see if he's building anything, which he doesn't think he is. He wouldn't say its really that heavy. It wasn't bothering him on the 05Apr2021, but possibly on 09Apr2021, he could tell there was some residual in his lungs. His cough was mostly when he breathes deep. It has been for the last 4 days. If he breathes deep he can feel a little restriction, like he doesn't have full capacity or the fact that he hasn't done anything physical. So, then he feels like a little tickle that will agitate it to make him want to cough. He doesn't believe he had any headache. He had a fever the day before he got the test. The fevers have resolved at this point. The fevers were on Monday and Tuesday- his temperature was 100.3 and the day earlier it was 101.8, both fevers were in the evening. He took Theraflu, and since then his temperature has been 98, 99, and lower. He doesn't think he is dehydrated. He has not done anything too physical to know if he felt weak. He asked the doctor after if it was safe to follow up with the 19Apr2021 second Covid shot. His doctor said yes, but the nurse who administered the IV said he should wait 90 days. He thought originally with the Covid, they talked about no COVID shots until 90 days after having COVID. But since he had the ""cocktail"" he doesn't know if that expediates it or the fact that he put this stuff in. Either way, he needs someone to give a straight answer, and if he gets 2 out of 3 people telling him the same answer, he guesses he will go that route. Outcome of event was unknown.

A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper arm on 19Mar2021 (batch/lot number: EN6207; expiration date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing arthritis, ongoing intermittent tinnitus - she has a history of noise exposure and intermittent tinnitus in the past but was certainly unremarkable, she shrunk before the vaccine - she was five seven her whole life and then thinks she was only five six. Family history included hearing loss in her mother, grandmother, and uncle but that was with advanced age. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 first dose on 26Feb2021 via injection in her left upper arm (lot number: E and then either I or 1 9266; expiration date unknown) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced severe tinnitus on Mar2021, tinnitus was reported as worsened. She received the second dose of the Covid vaccine on 19Mar2021 and reported a day or two later, she started experiencing tinnitus. She stated that she has been on and off steroids for the tinnitus. She asked if there has been a correlation identified between the vaccine and tinnitus. She asked was this a side effect of the vaccine. She was asking for any information such as studies, articles, awareness and frequency, regarding tinnitus being experienced after the vaccine. She was calling about the COVID 19 vaccine. She stated she was formally a retired audiologist she was calling because she was wondering what information Pfizer has about the onset of tinnitus. She stated after the second vaccine, she has developed significant tinnitus and as an audiologist she has trained people about tinnitus. She asked was this a symptom of the vaccine. She stated she knows tinnitus was a side effect of the COVID virus but was unsure if it was a side effect of the vaccine. She stated as a matter of fact she went to the national adverse reaction to report her reaction but not the particular Pfizer website. She stated she turns 51 next week and was currently 50. She stated she was five six as she has shrunk. She clarified she shrunk before the vaccine and stated she was five seven her whole life and then thinks she was only five six. She stated her doctor does not know she has this side effect. She stated she was going to see an ear nose throat friend but she was waiting. Severe tinnitus: She stated this started between 1 and 2 days after she received the vaccine which was on 19Mar2021 so either 20Mar2021 or 21Mar2021. She stated it may have got worse she had taken a short round of steroids and the tinnitus got better after the first two days and then the tinnitus returned and had no response to the steroids and she has done this twice. She stated the first two days of steroid usage she feels relief then the tinnitus comes back and she said to heck with it and stopped the steroid. She stated the tinnitus was a constant bilateral high frequency pure tone just very high pitch. She stated this was medically significant because it was a significant finding but not life-threatening. First dose was an injection in her left upper arm and received on 26Feb2021 unknown NDC number and expiry date. She stated the lot number was E and then either I or 1 9266. She stated it was actually not her turn in to get the vaccine but School System had extra doses and opened it up to anyone and everyone not just 1A or 1B. She stated she was 50 with no medical significant comorbidities other than arthritis and since the vaccine was opened up to the general public she was also eligible to get the second dose. She stated she believes the COVID 19 vaccine was related to the severe tinnitus because the onset was immediate and she has had tinnitus from other noise exposure but this was very different and not intermittent and does not come and go it was a different pitch too. She stated there has been no changes, no medication changes so everything else remained steady almost immediately after the vaccine her ears started ringing and she sort of ignored it and her ears were screaming loud a significant very loud even in the presence of background noise just a constant high pitch noise. She stated the tinnitus was impacted only 2 days from the steroids and then no impact after. She stated she considered taking a third dose and was still doing experiments. She stated was this something Pfizer was aware of and was there any information about monitoring people. She stated she knows there has not been a vaccine for that long and there may not be long term resolution but she wanted to report and ask what information Pfizer may already have. She stated the first steroid she started approximately 9 days after the onset and she had Medrol left over from her knee. She clarified the name as Medrol dose packs. She stated she thinks it was a 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Medrol dose pack that she had left over and she was able to set a series of 4, 3, 2, 2, and 1 but she threw packaging away and it was not a current medication as it was dated a couple years ago but she figured she would see if it would work and the first couple days it did but then not so much. Medrol dose packs unknown manufacturer, NDC number, lot number, expiry date. She stated moving forward her husband was a doctor and wrote Prednisone 10 mg and she was supposed to take 30 mg twice a day for 10 days and she took 30 mg once a day since she did not read the bottle and so she took 30 mg once a day for 5 days. She stated the same thing happened the first two days resolved and then nothing. Prednisone unknown manufacturer, NDC number, lot number, expiry date. She stated so she was actually considering taking 60 mg for 10 days and try to hit the tinnitus to see if she has an impact. She stated her concern/whole point to take the vaccine was to get antibodies and the body can recognize it but now a week and 2 weeks out she has taken a steroid which was suppressing her immune system and what does that do to the immune system. She stated the tinnitus was significant and she does not have a quiet moment and it was a cruel injustice as she used to train people and spent hours and hours counseling and now she was experiencing it. She stated it was significant enough to call and see if there was anything Pfizer knows more. She stated the first dose was given at 12:30 to 13:00 and the second dose was around 11:45 to 12:00. The adverse event did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician's office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).

They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender's Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

1265973,04/28/2021,CA,72.0,,,M,,"Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor's meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer's reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician's office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided.

She was also tapering off of prednisone and she did not want to be tapering off it because it was worked well for her. She could tell by her breathing that it was helped her. She could taste sodium in her mouth constantly since she had got the vaccination."" Second dose completed her prescribed therapy. Dates for Symptoms From 15Mar2021 to Ongoing Reported seriousness for Symptoms reported as Unspecified and the Symptoms was reported as worsened. Patient's doctor dropped her last week, told her she didn't know what to do with her, and that this was too stressful.  Onset of symptoms following first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine was on 17Mar2021. She couldn't breathe very well when she went in for the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She was ok the first day after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, seemed ok, arm didn't hurt; but then had onset of symptoms. She has been in bed the whole time since onset of symptoms, was in bed for over 2 weeks. She slept for 2 days straight, only got up for water and the bathroom. It was bad, getting hard to breathe. She had to use her emergency inhaler. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine messed up her Meniere's disease. Doctor started patient on Prednisone for these symptoms, and Prednisone is really the only thing that clears up Meniere's disease because her ears was full and she could not get up. Prednisone helped her and I relayed in her 'rescue' inhalers (treatment) because she did 2 in the morning, two inhalers anyway when she started to feel better, she got her second one and it made her worst.  She did not eat anything salty or anything, the barometric pressure was not bad. It was really funny because she had just finished everything and it was a few days before she had to go get her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine shot. She was just starting to feel normal, at least normal for her, she could get up normal and drive. They gave her the second shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and it was like a double. She clarified as she got like double the amount of symptoms that she had experienced following the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  She is tasting sodium in her mouth from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She can't have much sodium which struck up the Meniere's disease really bad the second day after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine; her allergies in her head went bonkers. She could not talk, it was closing up her throat, she was coughing every time she eats or dinks, and she's having a ""really bad"" adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the second dose. They had to take her out of the hospital to her car in a wheelchair ""right after"" getting the second shot. She could not get more than 1000 mg of sodium a day, she tastes it in her mouth constantly, she could not get rid of it and it was ""going through her system"". She wanted to know what to do, since her doctor told her to contact Pfizer. She wanted to know what part of the vaccine is doing that, she assures it is sodium, because sodium is in her mouth 24/7 and she could not get it out, she could not have that much sodium in her body. It was still getting really hard to breathe. She is still taking the Prednisone she was initially prescribed and started on for the symptoms that started after her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She is tapering off of Prednisone, and she shouldn't be tapering off, she thinks she needs to be Prednisone for some more days, maybe 3 more days, then she would be ok. It was prescribed as a 7-day burst of Prednisone. She mentioned that the only Prednisone that works on her is the Actavis manufactured Prednisone; her pharmacy orders it for her because they know that. She called the emergency room Saturday when she was really bad. They said they had a line there and it was going to be at least a 4 hour wait. With patient's low immune system, Meniere's disease and that she could hardly breathe she did not go to the emergency room because she could catch something and die while waiting. She decided she would just stay at home and rest. She has not had any Physician's office visit relative to event; she has a telephone appointment tomorrow to see if the doctor is going to be her doctor. She had to cancel her appointment with the doctor today because if she has something she doesn't want to spread it, she feels worse now and with the Meniere's she is tasting sodium in her mouth constantly from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, she does not eat a lot of salt. The flu shot takes her a couple of days, then she is right back up and Vaccination Last dose on Oct2020. Consumer stated that she has 'Meniere's' disease (History) and it made her worse.

He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching.

The injection was delivered into upper left arm. I felt fine at first. I stood and exited the room and began speaking with the pharmacist that had delivered the invention to receive instructions. Approximately 2-5 minutes after I received the injection I began to feel dizzy. After approximately 1 minute of dizziness I sat down.  I began to get extremely dizzy to the point of faintness. I noticed during this time that I was getting very sweaty. My skin over my whole body seemed to me to be damp from sweat and where I checked I was sweating visibly (no droplets formed? it was just dampness). At the same time I experienced nausea. I believed that I might throw up, so I requested something to throw up into. I never threw up. I continued to get more and more dizzy and I had trouble remaining upright (while seated). A woman observing me stated afterward that my eyes rolled back and that I fainted. I do not believe that I actually fainted because I remember hearing her tell the pharmacist that I had passed out. I had my eyes closed though, so it is possible that I fainted briefly.  The pharmacist called 911. I began to feel better approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I stopped sweating, and then the nausea subsided, and then my dizziness cleared up.   The EMTs arrived approximately 20 minutes after I received the vaccine and took my blood pressure. I do not remember the reading, but the EMT stated that it was not elevated. My blood oxygen was 99%. The EMT waited about 10 minutes and took my blood pressure again. He stated that it was higher, but not concerning. The EMT waited another 10-15 minutes and then left. Before he left, the EMT stated to me that I was one of 2 concurrent calls regarding adverse vaccine responses.   After this event I drank a bottle of  water. It did not seem to have an impact.   I have not received vaccinations since I was a child. I do not remember adverse reactions to injections when I was a child. I did pass out when giving blood approximately 12 years ago.

1266765,04/28/2021,PA,69.0,69,,F,,"I wasn't sure if I should report this or not. I mentioned I get intermittent muscle spasms in my leg that aren't even bad enough to complain to my doctor or anything. The night of the first injection I was in bed and a spasm started. I started to get up and it was horrible- it went thru my ***entire*** left leg  - the front and the back and the top and the bottom - the entire leg. I never had anything like that before and since. And it hurt badly. I considered asking my husband to call someone but I went into the bathroom - actually dragging that leg for the most part - and tried putting heat on via my hairdryer. It actually made it worse which is the opposite of what should happen when I usually get anything like that. Then I tried putting on this salve we use for such things made from Arnica called ArnicareCream. It actually helped the spasms completely and I had to keep it bent while the salve worked itself in  - then I could at least walk it off the rest of the way and went back to bed with no issues. I didn't report it to my doctor or anything because I thought maybe it had nothing to do with the shot.  Plus no one else was reporting anything like that - it wasn't in the list of possible side effects.  But it scared me a lot.  I'm only reporting it now because a woman not all that far from us was paralyzed by the shot about 10 hrs later  I think (not the same day and date)  and it sounded somewhat similar in a weird way. It's like the shot ""knows"" what the bad parts of your body are and hones right in on it. I did not expect to have any issues either. But it seemed much to coincidental that this happened so far only once in my life and on the night of the first shot.  Another minor issue was that my left harm hurt when she jabbed it (second shot did not) and I experienced no pain at all in the arm until a few weeks after the **second** shot which I didn't report. It still intermittently hurts but it feels like it's more related to when I overcarry items, etc.  So again, that might not be anything. Plus I'm at the age where I have rudiments of arthritis most likely.

She was rushed to the Hospital where she was sedated and put on a breathing machine.  It did not seem as if she would survive,  the entire morning was a whirlwind and traumatizing.  In the afternoon they transferred her to the ICU unit.  Luckily after 24 hours they lowered sedation and she had no brain injury etc.,  we were all amazed she was alive. The doctors ran tests etc. to find out what caused this cardiac arrest event,  they found NOTHING - no blood clot, no clogged arteries,  nothing that could have caused this.  My mother also has had not health conditions before this that would have caused this.  She now has a defibrillator implanted and her life will never be the same,  her families either,  we will constantly worry.

At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me.
