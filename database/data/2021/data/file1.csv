So, wanted to know, is it approved for a 5th dose of Dtap plus polio and is it safe. Question number 1. Question number 2 is: Is it possible to help her locate it somewhere closer, instead of having to go to another facility, which was a 2-hour drive away. Called every pediatrician, every family doctor, every pharmacy and she can think of in the area and everyone orders through one particular pharmacy and for some reason, on their computers are unable to order QUADRACEL whether that's due to manufacturer restrictions. She doesn't know if there's a pharmacy (unintelligible) like contract. Everyone in town seems to give KINRIX, which she doesn't want to give to her son and want to give him QUADRACEL because she know, in the past, he's tolerated PENTACEL really, really well and want to stick with what works for his body and, like, want to spend money and buy and pay for QUADRACEL vaccine and just running into a million brick walls trying to get it.

Patient stated that on 12/18 he got the COVID vaccine. It was on a Friday. The following day he had a headache and he felt flu-like. He stated that those symptoms resolved quickly. He then had the facial weakness today (11 days after the vacciantion). He has not had any fever, sweats, or chills. Patient stated that he had called ask a nurse, and he was advised to hang up and call 911 and go to the emergency room. However, he stated he was an EMT and did not feel that was necessary. He denies headache. He has not had any vision change. He has been eating and drinking well without any difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance - patient was not in any distress. He was conversant, pleasant and appropriate. HEENT - normal conjunctivae and lids. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Patient was not able to close his left eyelid. Normal ear canals. TMs are pearly gray with bright light reflex. Neck - supple. No lymphadenopathy. Skin - pink, warm and dry. Neuro - alert and oriented. Deep tendon reflexes 2+ upper and lower extremities with no focal weakness. Normal range of motion. Patient can raise his right eyebrow. Could not raise his left eyebrow. There was impaired eyelid closure on the left; tight closure on the right. Smiling of the face revealed lateralization to the right side. When frowning, he had upper and lower facial paralysis on the left with flattening of the forehead. The patient could not tighten the left side of his mouth.   ASSESSMENT: Bell's palsy.   PLAN: Discussed pathophysiology of Bell's palsy. Advised patient I recommended him to call the number that he got with the information when he received his COVID vaccine. Advised patient that I could not definitively correlate the Bell's palsy with the COVID immunization, but that he can call the number he has to let them know of his symptoms. Discussed treatment options. Since patient woke up with his symptoms this morning, I advised patient that he would have hopefully the best outcome because he would be able to get on the steroid and antiviral soon after developing the symptoms. He is to wear an eye patch to prevent corneal drying or abrasion of the left eye at night. Using Lacri-Lube at night before placing the eye patch and then following up by using artificial tears during the day.   Patient was placed on prednisone 60 mg once a day for 1 week to be taken with food. Valtrex 1,000 mg 3 times a day for 1 week.   Side effects of medication discussed. Handouts were provided.

She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it's tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event.

ASSESMENT and PLAN � Erythematous, hive-like region of the left deltoid that began 12 days after the Moderna vaccine.  This is likely a localized delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction.  Bedside ultrasound performed by myself.  I do not note any pocket of fluid to indicate an abscess.  However, there is a small possibility that this could be cellulitis.  A cellulitis would be much more concerning.  From an allergic perspective, she has no evidence of anaphylaxis based on the timeframe and her current symptoms.  As a result, she will continue on Benadryl for now at 50 mg every 6 hours and will be placed on doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 10 days.  May use prednisone taper but she should wait for 48 hours.  If she has improvement with doxycycline and Benadryl, she should continue with this.  The Benadryl is truly as needed and if it is improving, she does not need to continue on it.  She will.",,,,,,,,,Y,12/21/2020,01/03/2021,13,,OTH,,Albuterol inhaler,none known,"? Anxiety � ?

A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 29Dec2020 17:45 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2003 and ongoing, tachycardia and major surgery. Concomitant medication included maintenance inhaler (unspecified) for asthma. Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn't had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn't feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn't want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website's first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn't fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of the event tachycardia was recovered in Dec2020, event lightheadedness was recovering and unknown for the other events. The reporter assessed the event 'tachycardia' as Serious (Medically Significant).; Sender's Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tachycardia with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

0923483,01/06/2021,TX,66.0,66,,F,,"1.    ARM PAIN AND IMMOBILITY.   On 8/17/2020, I received the Pneumovax 23 vaccine in my right arm by injection around 8:30 a.m. at my PCP?s office by his nurse.  Within 2 hours of receiving the vaccine, my right arm started feeling like it had a crick or catch in it.  I stretched my arm but the crick was still there.  Over the next 2 hours, my right arm became sorer, eventually becoming very painful.  By noon (~ 4 hours after injection), my entire arm was in excruciating pain and if I even attempted to move it, the pain was so severe it literally brought tears to my eyes.  (I have a high tolerance to pain, so when I say the pain was excruciating, it really was!)    My PCP?s office was closed for lunch and I left a voice message for the nurse.  In the meantime, I called my local Pharmacy and spoke with the pharmacist.  He said to take Tylenol.  The pain was so great that at some point I started taking hydrocodone that I had on hand.  Around 2:00 p.m. the PCP nurse returned my call, I explained the problem, she consulted the Dr. and called me back.  She said they were not aware, and had never heard, of this happening before.   The nurse (and I) was very thankful that the injection was in my RIGHT arm, otherwise we both would have thought I was having a cardiac event!  Same day, the excruciating pain continued, the pain meds were not effective.  To get out of bed and go to the bathroom, I had to ?hug? my right arm with my left hand/arm to keep it as still as possible.  The pain extended down my right arm to just above my wrist.  I could wiggle my fingers and flex my hand without pain.  The pain also started to go up into my right shoulder and right upper back.  By around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. (~10 hours after injection), the pain in the right shoulder/upper back stopped progressing.  Over the next 24 hours, the pain very slowly started retreating.  It took several days before I could use my right arm well, e.g., motion was limited, had trouble brushing my teeth, putting on clothes, etc.  By about day #9, I was finally able to pull on/pull off tight-fitting clothes over my head.  At 2 weeks after injection, my arm was back to about 98%.  IMPORTANT to note that the focal point of the pain was/is NOT at the injection site (which was more on the back side of my upper right arm).  The focal point of the pain IS, and STILL IS, around on the FRONT side of my upper right arm.  The injection site never got red nor warm.  I had no fever.  To this day (1/6/2021), over 4 months later, I still have the ?pain? at this focal point when doing certain things.  For example, sleeping on my right side, trying to scratch or wash my back, and moving my arm in various directions.  I?ve tried massaging it myself assuming the pain is muscle-related, but that just made it worse.  As I write this, the pain definitely has not lessened, if anything, it?s gotten a little bit worse ? meaning I?m experiencing it more often.  If you have any suggestions on how to get this pain to go away, I?d really appreciate it!  I assume it?s muscle-related, but I suppose it could be nerve-related. ??  2.    HOT FLASHES.  At the same time (on 8/17/2020) that my right arm was becoming more painful and immobile, my post-menopausal hot flashes ramped up.  For the past many months, my hot flashes had been mild to moderate; on this day (8/17) they became horrendous (i.e., severe), reminiscent to when I first experienced hot flashed around age 52).  These hot flashes come on suddenly, last a couple of minutes, and oddly enough repeat about every 40 minutes.  (It was uncanny, I could almost set my watch by these hot flashes!)  As I write this over 4 months later (1/6/2021), the hot flashes are still bad, and still come fairly regularly.

They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.

I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.

She also wanted to get more information on if the patient should proceed with dose number 2 of the vaccine. The patient developed the Bell's Palsy within 5 minutes after getting the vaccine.

On exam she did not have any weakness, facial droop or dumbness with sharp or dull testing. The patient perceived it along the face still and the arm.

Regarding treatment, the patient was started on steroids on 31Dec2020. She did not start her on an anti-viral as she did not want it to impact her immunity to the vaccine.

My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin.

I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn't roll my body up without assistance and I'd need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn't go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it'd be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn't until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I'm usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue.

The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis.

He received his flu shot yesterday in his left leg.  He describes it as tickling around his fingertips, and feels like there is dirt under his fingernails; he reports a similar sensation in his feet.  He has a low-grade fever of 100.0, a tummy ache, and states that his chest and throat area might be a little sore.  Patient's mother is a nurse and reports his heart rate to be around 110.  Overall Patient is eating, sleeping, and voiding well and seems to be himself.  Denies shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, dizziness, lightheadedness, loss of appetite, fatigue, and syncopal episodes.   TREATMENT:  Patient is a 6 y.o. male presenting via video visit with his mother today for evaluation for numbness and tingling in his hands and feet following flu immunization.  Family counseled that this is likely a systemic reaction with fever, with a hyperventilation and/or anxiety component.  Instructed parents to provide Patient with a paper bag, and have him breathe in and out slowly, to rebreathe his air and normalize his carbon dioxide levels.  He may continue to repeat this maneuver if the symptoms should continue throughout the day.  Following initial breathing exercise, Patient's numbness and tingling resolved.  Parents advised to keep patient home from school in the event that repeated breathing exercises are needed today.  In the event that numbness and tingling do not resolve with breathing exercise, family instructed to bring Patient into clinic for further evaluation; additional workup may include evaluation of electrolyte imbalances.  Case discussed with Dr. who was in agreement and provided breathing exercise instruction.     Reviewed symptomatic care, signs and symptoms of danger, and reasons to seek care emergently or return for evaluation.  If there are any further concerns, they may contact the clinic.
