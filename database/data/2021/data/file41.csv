Upon arrival and check in, the patient declined any comorbidities and health history but did state that he was nervous. After administration of the vaccine by  NP, the patient lowered himself to the ground, from a sitting position, and had a 60 second tonic clonic seizure. Seizure precautions such as turning the patient on his side, supporting his head, and calling EMS were taken during the seizure. After 60 seconds, the patient came to and asked what happened. PPHD staff oriented the patient to what had happened, to which he proceeded to say ?oh that is normal for me when I get anxious.? With the help of PPHD staff and his wife, the patient was brought to a sitting position and given a granola bar and water to his request. According to clinic lead RN, ?his skin was normal in appearance for race, ethnicity, and age. He was mildly diaphoretic. He verbalized feelings of anxiety and worry surrounding the vaccine.?   As EMS arrived on the scene and began assessing vital signs the patients anxiety appeared to increase; he became less verbal, closed his eyes, and his breathing pattern became shallow. The patient then had a second seizure at this time lasting approximately 25 seconds. When the patient came to he immediately verbalized, ?I?m good, I?m good, I?m fine?. He was slow to respond to verbal cues, but persistently refused transport to the local acute care hospital for further evaluation. He rested on the ground in supine position for approximately 25 minutes, with his partner and EMS at his side. Upon further evaluation of the patient and his wife, it was determined that the patient has a history of seizure activities when he is nervous and that he was ?expecting? this to happen.

The vaccine was given in my right arm.  Also I was injected high up on my arm, very close to my shoulder.   That day I was okay, but the following morning I was very thirsty and had no appetite.

I went to bed early and during the night I was sweating.  The next day (2 days after vaccine) I woke up with a terrible headache, again, I usually never get headaches.  It lasted all day. I took some aspirin, which did help.  I was still quite fatigued also.

He believed that my presentation was consistent with underlying inflammatory arthritis rather than vaccine side effects. Over the next couple weeks I had a thorough rheumatologic workup including extensive lab work and imaging, and was ultimately diagnosed with inflammatory polyarthritis with enthesitis with my triggering event for the initial arthritis flare being the second Covid vaccine. I was initially started on high dose prednisone (up to 60mg) and methotrexate with an upward titration but was unable to tolerate the medication due to side effects and lack of improvement in the enthesitis and have since started cimzia with plan to taper off of methotrexate.

This case corresponds to Table 3 reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of study that aimed at vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates using methodology from the US Flu VE Network (research database) are compared with VE estimates using data from a clinical surveillance software system (administrative database). The advantages and disadvantages of both methods of estimating influenza VE are discussed. [The study took place in emergency departments, hospital-based clinics and outpatient primary and urgent care sites that are part of a large (40 hospital, 700 doctor's offices and outpatient sites) integrated health system]. The patient had not received antiviral medication in the 7 days before enrollment into the study. The patient belonged to administrative database group. No information on patient family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received unspecified Influenza vaccine 2018-2019 season (administration site unspecified, dose not reported; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported. On an unspecified date, more than or equal to 14 days after vaccination, the patient presented with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) including cough within 7 days of symptom onset. Patient's respiratory specimen from nasopharyngeal and/or throat was taken for influenza virus testing by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient had emergency department visit and was diagnosed with Influenza B infection. [In this study, Briefly, patients aged more than or equal to 6 months presenting with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) including cough within 7 days of symptom onset were enrolled at participating outpatient healthcare facilities, including community physician offices, urgent care centers and emergency departments. Respiratory specimens (nasal and throat swabs from patients aged more than or equal to 2 years or nasal swabs only from patients aged less than 2 years) for influenza virus testing (including virus type and subtype) by RT-PCR. The influenza circulation period, defined as the dates between the first and last influenza positive research enrollment during each season, was determined for each year in both the administrative and research databases. The respiratory viral panels (RVPs) were performed on a nasopharyngeal swab. RVP tests might be conducted year-round, but were more routinely conducted in October through April on patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms. For patients with more than one visit with RVP tests less than 14 days apart, only data from the first visit were included. If visits occurred greater than 14 days apart, then data from both visits were included. For patients with more than one visit with tests less than 14 days apart, only data from the first visit were included. If visits occurred greater than 14 days apart, then data from both visits were included]. The case was considered as suspected vaccination failure being time to onset unknown. The case was considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure. Treatment was unknown. Outcome was not reported. The authors commented ""In this comparison of influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates from a test-negative case-control research study and administrative data sources, subjects differed by demographic characteristics of age, race and site of enrollment. The administrative database included older patients, more non-whites and more patients enrolled in the emergency department. In emergency departments, research enrollees were younger, more often male and non-white, and VE against any influenza and all influenza A was significantly higher than was found in the administrative database. Whereas, in the outpatient clinics, age distribution was more evenly distributed in the administrative database and vaccination rates appeared to be higher than in the research database, but there were no significant differences in VE estimates. These differences may be attributed to the fact that recruitment for this research study was limited to two emergency departments (one a pediatric hospital) among several included in the administrative database and to a greater emphasis on research enrollment at urgent and primary care centers"". The authors concluded ""The selection of the appropriate method for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on a multitude of factors. Among those factors is sample size, which likely obscured significant differences between administrative and research database VE estimates in this study except when limiting the analyses to the emergency departments. In this case, the research estimates were better. Differences in the types of persons enrolled in the databases, suggest that research estimates may be more generalizable. Other advantages of research databases for VE estimates include lack of clinician-related selection bias for testing and less misclassification of vaccination status because multiple sources are used. The advantages of the administrative databases are potentially shorter time to VE results and lower cost."".

[The objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of tralokinumab versus placebo with respect to immune responses of two concomitantly administered, non-live vaccines. The study also aimed to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tralokinumab treatment with concomitantly administered vaccines. ECZTRA 5 (NCT03562377) was a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, 30-week trial. Eligible adults were randomized 1:1 (tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo, 107:108 every 2 weeks [q2w] for 16 weeks), receiving Tdap (tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis) and meningococcal vaccines at week 12. Primary endpoints were positive anti-tetanus and anti-meningococcal responses (week 12-week 16; non-inferiority margin, -25%; responder, more than 3-fold immunoglobulin-G increase). The study enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe AD, aged 18-54 years, who were candidates for systemic therapy and had a recent (within 1 year) history of inadequate response to topical treatments or for whom topical treatments were medically inadvisable. Other key inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of AD for more than or equal to 1 year, AD involvement of more than or equal to 10% body surface area at screening and baseline, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) more than or equal to 12 at screening and more than or equal to 16 at baseline, and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) more than or equal to 3 at screening and baseline. Patients were excluded if administration of either vaccine was contraindicated or medically inadvisable or if they had received any vaccine (except influenza virus vaccines) within 3 months prior to screening, any meningococcal vaccine within 1 year prior to screening, or any tetanus-, diphtheria-, or pertussis-containing vaccine within 5 years prior to screening. Patients were recruited from 11 sites in country and 35 sites in the country by the site's investigator]. In this patient, administration of the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine provided in this trial was not contraindicated or medically inadvisable. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received one dose of Boostrix (Tdap: tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) and one dose of Menactra (meningococcal vaccine) administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (one vaccine in each arm), before tralokinumab (batch number not provided for both). The patient randomized to tralokinumab received 300 mg every 2 weeks [q2w] for 16 weeks after initial loading dose (600 mg) on day 0 (baseline). The age of vaccination was not provided. [All patients randomized to tralokinumab received an initial loading dose of 600 mg on day 0 (baseline). At week 12, patients received one dose of combined tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap; Boostrix) vaccine and one dose of meningococcal vaccine (Menactra), administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (one vaccine in each arm), before tralokinumab or placebo injections, and in accordance with local labeling. These vaccines were chosen as they are both common inclusions in country-wide vaccination schedules, and represent different antigen structures (protein and polysaccharide)]. On an unspecified date, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient had eight serious adverse events (SAEs) within the safety follow-up period. Five of these SAEs contributed to a fatal outcome for this patient. All eight SAEs were assessed as being unrelated to the investigational medicinal product (IMP). An additional SAE reported in the same patient during the treatment period was failure to thrive; also had a fatal outcome and was considered as possibly related to treatment by the investigator. [At week 16, non-inferiority of tralokinumab versus placebo for immune responses to Tdap (91.9% vs 96.1%) and meningococcal (86.0% vs 84.2%) vaccines was demonstrated. During treatment, adverse-event rates were lower for tralokinumab versus placebo; most events were mild or moderate. The primary endpoints were positive anti-tetanus and anti-meningococcal responses from weeks 12-16. A positive anti-tetanus response was defined as having at least a three-fold immunoglobulin (Ig) G increase compared to week 12 if IgG less than or equal to 1.0 IU/mL at week 12 or IgG more than or equal to 2.5 IU/mL if IgG more than 1.0 IU/mL at week 12. A positive anti-meningococcal response was defined as IgG more than or equal to 3.0 mcg/mL with at least a three-fold increase compared to week 12, in three of the four assays used (for each meningococcal subtype included in the vaccine: A, C, W, and Y). Secondary endpoints aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tralokinumab alongside vaccine administration, using the full analysis set. Upon completing the 16-week treatment period, eligible patients were invited to enter an open-label, long-term, extension trial of tralokinumab under a separate trial protocol (ECZTEND, NCT03587805); patients who used rescue medication in ECZTRA 5 were still eligible for inclusion in ECZTEND. Otherwise, patients were required to complete a 14-week, off-treatment, safety follow-up period. The rate of AEs, the number of moderate AEs, and the number of SAEs were higher in the tralokinumab group compared with the placebo group; this difference was driven by a single patient, in whom 18 of the 24 AEs were reported. The overall rate of AEs in the safety follow-up period was lower in the tralokinumab group versus the placebo group (69.59 vs 118.3 events per 100 patient-years' follow-up, respectively). Overall, 11 SAEs were reported in the safety follow-up period in four patients (two in each treatment group), with more events for tralokinumab (nine) compared with placebo (two). The higher rate in the tralokinumab group was driven by the single patient, in whom eight of the nine SAEs within the safety follow-up period occurred; five of these SAEs contributed to a fatal outcome for this patient. All eight SAEs were assessed as being unrelated to the IMP. An additional SAE reported in the same patient during the treatment period (""failure to thrive"") also had a fatal outcome and was considered as possibly related to treatment by the investigator].  On an unspecified date, the patient was died with an unknown cause. It was unknown whether the patient's autopsy was performed or not. This case has been considered serious due to death. The author commented, ""The investigator did not believe that tralokinumab was the cause of the SAE, but due to their limited experience with tralokinumab in humans, a causal relationship for such a general symptom as weight loss could not be entirely ruled out. All SAEs reported in this patient were not considered related to tralokinumab by the study sponsor, based on the patient's medical history and concomitant medications. These results indicate that tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks treatment did not affect the immune responses to Tdap or meningococcal vaccines, with vaccine-induced immune response rates within expected ranges. For both vaccines, the 95% CI for treatment differences were within the pre-specified -25% noninferiority margin, thereby demonstrating the noninferiority of tralokinumab compared with placebo with respect to immune responses to each concomitantly administered vaccine. Additionally, tralokinumab was safe and well tolerated when administered concomitantly with the selected vaccines, with a safety profile comparable to three phase 3 trials. In this phase 2 study, the treatment difference versus placebo was similar to that seen in the larger ECZTRA 1 and 2 monotherapy trials, further substantiating the robust efficacy reported at week 16 and over 52 weeks in these phase 3 trials. The results of this study indicate that tralokinumab's specific neutralization of IL-13 does not affect the immune response to concomitantly administered Tdap and meningococcal vaccines, suggesting that standard, non-live vaccines are effective and can be safely prescribed in tralokinumab-treated adults with moderate-to-severe AD without the need for tralokinumab interruption. The effect of tralokinumab on vaccines against viral-borne diseases (such as influenza), however, was not examined, which may be an area for future study to inform vaccination programs and guidelines. In this study, data supports noninferiority of tralokinumab versus placebo for vaccine-induced immune responses to Tdap (91.9% vs 96.1%) and meningococcal (86.0% vs 84.2%) vaccines."" The author concluded, ""Tralokinumab 300 mg q2w treatment did not affect immune responses to Tdap and meningococcal vaccines, and was well tolerated when administered concomitantly, with safety profile comparable to phase 3 trials.""; Reported Cause(s) of Death: unknown cause of death",Y,,,,,,,,N,,,,,UNK,,TRALOKINUMAB,Atopic dermatitis (Moderate-to-severe),,,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2021GS,2,04/01/2021,,,,

On an unknown date, 3 years after receiving Rotavirus vaccine, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), rotavirus infection (serious criteria hospitalization) and covid-19 (serious criteria hospitalization). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, rotavirus infection and covid-19 were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, rotavirus infection and covid-19 to be related to Rotavirus vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure, in a patient aged between 0-17-year-old of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with Unspecified Rotavirus vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a part of a study that aimed to characterizes the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children in the first month of known community transmission, from 5th March 2020 to 8th April 2020. [In this study, Data were submitted on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reporting. Additionally, results of COVID-19 laboratory tests were reported duplicated by person to determine the percentage of residents who tested positive for COVID-19]. No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received unspecified rotavirus vaccine (administration site unspecified, dosage unknown, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported.  On an unspecified date between 5th March 2020 to 8th April 2020, 3 years after last recorded rotavirus vaccine administration date, the patient had laboratory confirmed Covid-19 infection. The patient was hospitalized and was evaluated for viral and bacterial co-infection with multiplex respiratory pathogen panels. The patient had positive rotavirus stool antigen and was diagnosed with Rotavirus co-infection. The patient required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The patient did not meet. [In this study, reported presence of fever and dyspnea were significantly higher in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients. Reported presence of fever and dyspnea were significantly higher in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients. Of those hospitalized, all either had an underlying comorbidity or co-infection detected; 7 had an underlying comorbidity and 4 had coinfection. Three had a history of chronic lung disease, 2 had a history of cardiac or congenital heart disease, 2 had Trisomy 21, and 2 had immunodeficiency (1 with immune dysfunction related to a genetic disorder; 1 with recent myelosuppressive chemotherapy). One patient who required intensive care had an underlying condition and coinfection. At the time of manuscript submission, the no COVID-19 related pediatric deaths were reported in this cohort. Among 27 patients with known travel history, 2 reported travel within the 14 days prior to symptom onset. Forty (63%) had at least 1 additional household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Among the 34 unique households with multiple laboratory-confirmed infections, the median number of laboratory-confirmed infections was 2 (range, 2-5), and 31 households had at least 1 adult who also had a laboratory-confirmed infection. For 15 households for which all necessary data to determine transmission were available, 11 were adult-to-child, 2 were child-to-child, and 2 were child-to-adult. None of the 64 pediatric patients were associated with a recognized outbreak in a congregate setting]. The case was considered as suspected vaccination failure being dosing schedule unknown. The case was considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure. Treatment was unknown. Outcome was not reported. The authors commented ""Upon review of testing volume across the city, infants represented 17.5% (183/1044) of all who were known to be tested during this time period and 13% of all pediatric patients, similar to national data. In the infants accounted for 40% of all hospitalizations and 57% of ICU hospitalizations, and many were found to have underlying comorbidities or coinfection, supporting a heightened risk perception for this group of infants or suggesting that risk perception plays a role in hospitalization. A recent research letter revealed coinfection in 24 of 116 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2; the youngest patient in the SARS-CoV-2 coinfection group was aged 9 years. While patients with coinfections did not differ significantly in age from those infected with SARS-CoV-2 only (mean age, 46.9 years vs 51.1 years, a 4.2-year difference), no specific pediatric data on coinfection and disease severity were presented. Enhanced case investigation of all hospitalized revealed that, as with infants, underlying comorbidities and coinfection might have contributed to severe disease. Of concern was the finding that the majority of cases had multiple persons with confirmed COVID-19 living at home"".  The authors concluded ""Enhanced case investigation of hospitalized patients revealed that underlying comorbidities and coinfection might have contributed to severe disease. Given frequency of household transmission, healthcare providers should consider alternative dispositional planning for affected families of children living with comorbidities"".

A change of scope to was made as a consequence of the Quality Control analysis of the returned samples which identified the presence of white particles. The white particles have been identified as product formulation related particles, and, therefore are considered as inherent to the vaccine. Indeed, Kinrix vaccine is formulated with aluminum salt used as antigen carrier. In some conditions, the aluminum salt can aggregate and generate some small white particles. An investigation has been conducted, including review of the reported defect trends, the returned samples, the retained samples and our production records, which has demonstrated that the subject batch was produced in compliance with the applicable procedures and met all required specifications. Moreover, the in-depth investigation performed on raw materials and at all manufacturing steps has not identified any root cause which could explain the atypical number of inherent particles observed in the syringes. Since these particles are inherent to the vaccine and based on the investigation results, data trended and safety assessment, GlaxoSmithKline was confident that there is no risk for the patient.

I discovered light hives running along the inside of my right arm and along the right side of my torso, from the side of my right breast to my waistline.  I immediately took two (2) Benadryl capsules that we had in the house.  I also washed the hives with soap and water in case this was from an external source.  I had immediate relief from the itching and the hives immediately began to disappear, so I returned to bed and slept.  When I awoke in the morning at my normal time, I did not have any additional itching and there were no hives present anywhere on my body.  I went about my day and was at an appointment outside of the home when itching returned at approximately 1:00 P.M.  on 03/20/21.  This time it started on the outer side of my right breast and spread completely across the torso beneath both breasts within 45 minutes.  Also at 1:45 P.M., I felt a couple of episodes of light chills and ""goose bumps.""  When I arrived home by 2:00 P.M., I discovered that there were hives not only beneath my breasts, but also across the torso from one side to the other underneath the waistband of my jeans, as well as in a couple of random spots on my stomach.  I immediately took two (2) Benadryl capsules and took my temperature as well, which indicated a low-grade fever of about 100 degrees even.   I called at 24-hour Nurse Hotline, described my situation (including that the Benadryl I had just taken was immediately working on the new set of hives and itching), and was told to continue taking the Benadryl for a complete 24-hour cycle, as well as given information about what to watch for regarding the hives and instructed to obtain further medical help if the hives worsened despite taking the Benadryl.  Over the next several hours, the hives continued to recur (as well as the itching) and to spread throughout my torso and onto my back and arms.  I ended up in the Emergency Room after midnight when the Benadryl no longer did anything and the hives continued to worsen in both color and size.  I received an IV treatment of Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid, and got immediate relief.  My heart rate reached 105 for a bit in the ER, but lowered to 95.  I had to continue taking these meds over the next several days at home, during which my hives eventually left some areas but spread down my legs to the tops of my feet before disappearing completely by 03/25/21.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/16/2021,03/20/2021,4,None.,PVT,,No prescriptions.

He added that the Monday after (15Mar2021) over the weekend, it got worse. He mentioned that he talked with his neurologist who told him to speak with his ophthalmologist who the patient spoke to on Tuesday. The patient mentioned that both doctors came up with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. He inquired since one of his doctor's is concerned about him taking the second vaccine and the other doctor was ok with it. He mentioned that one doctor had a feeling of some bias, and the other doctor. He did some research in an association with people diagnosed with it. One of his doctors said that he is immunocompromised, so he looked at autoimmune information, and the information says it is ok. He reached out to the local medical center that is doing the vaccination and they are unwilling to talk with him over the phone. He has read on the association site and they seem to recommend to take it. He did not want to rebel against his doctor, so he wants to be sure. He inquired if it was safe for him to take his second dose and wanted to get good factual information that can give him a good starting point that is related. He mentioned that his second dose schedule was on 30Mar2021. He also stated that initial onset of Bell's Palsy with left eye droop, he was on a high dose steroid regimen and that seem to help which he finished up early Feb2021. It was mentioned that the event initial onset was not after the vaccine. The Ophthalmologist checked him on Tuesday and his left eye which he could barely open, and his doctor also noticed right eye droop. He stated without medication, it is worsening but with his medication, it is definitely helping to transmit between nerves. He stated before the medication this time of day he could not lift his left eye longer throughout the day, the more difficult it is for the muscles as they become weaker. There was noticeably drooping of the right eye. The ophthalmologist exam on his right eye was drooping which was ongoing. It is still there, his wife and he were comparing their eyes and how much he could open it, and it surprised them how little he could open it. It was different and strange. The time reported for the drooping of the right eye was 2:30 pm and persisting but the left eye was worse. He hasn't noticed a difference about the same, medication has been helping. It was also mentioned that myasthenia gravis reported that it started on the 16Mar2021 2:30 pm (talked to the Neurologist to compare notes, so maybe 3:30 - 4:00) when they made the initial diagnosis and started testing the next day. He is waiting for blood work to come back, but all the tests have pointed in that direction. Myasthenia gravis was ongoing, but the condition has worsened and the medications at a therapeutic level, it keeps it at bay. He further added that his eye became so hard to see, so he pyridostigmine bromide on 17Mar2021 since he couldn't open or focus, he thought he would give it a try. It works when he can't focus and if he doesn't take, it he will go back to where he was before. He will not be able to open his eye and the double vision will come back. The events required physician's office visit but did not require emergency room visit. He mentioned that there were 3 test and one more scheduled. The first one was a common test; the first initial test diagnose Myasthenia gravis. The second test was the ice test since they went on the assumption in their initial thinking it was Bell's Palsy and in his, doctor's, opinion it didn't look right.

The patient was hospitalized for infection after hernia surgery (infection) from 22Feb2021 to 24Feb2021. For chronic bronchitis, patient stated that he was never really diagnosed, that it's just like having a cough all the time. It felt like his lungs are not big enough for his body and that he got winded quickly.  He was strong and could do manual labor, even after the liver transplant, but that he has noticed the last couple of years that the cold felt like it's freezing his skeleton. He has had pneumonia 3 times altogether. He was unable to specify dates but he knew that he had it post-transplant in 2013. There isn't a test for psoriatic arthritis so he was unable to provide a diagnosis date.  He had been experiencing this for the last 10 years. He was diagnosed with psoriasis when he was 25.

He was a liver transplant patient and that the hospital where he received the transplant likes to keep things in house. After the hernia surgery he couldn't drive or sit down because it was uncomfortable and that the jostling of the car was too much. Patient reported that he would see his physician who recently retired once a month for a prescription for pain meds that he needs for back issues, psoriatic arthritis, and scar tissue from being operated on 4 times. He has had about 10 Covid tests. It made people feel more comfortable when he shows them the negative results. He has been stressed over waiting for the Covid test, that the stress then aggravates the psoriasis which aggravates the arthritis. After the vaccine he clarified he did not feel right. He said that he didn't feel sick, just wasn't 100%. He was tired and felt like he was getting a cold after receiving his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Which he did, he had a cold/cough.

For infection after hernia surgery, patient reported that he couldn't remember the hospital dates but that he was admitted for 2 days and received IV antibiotics. He was hospitalized on 22Feb2021 or 24Feb2021.  His doctor had told him that the swelling was from the trauma of the procedure. For little cough and felt like he was getting a cold, patient reported that he had been on oral antibiotics after his surgery and his doctor increased the dosage to help with the respiratory infection, it was a cough.

Patient stated that shingles, she was sure it was shingles, will not prevent her from getting second dose. She mentioned she was stuck, this was all new, and her doctor couldn't tell her because he didn't know. She was not sure what to do.

My muscles instead of my bones began to hurt extremely. I could barely move. I broke down crying a couple of times due to the pain being so intense.

It was very painful to the touch and uncomfortable to move my arm.  I contacted medical services (I work at a medical research center) and they asked me to come on-site to be evaluated.  I was seen by Nurse Practitioner sometime in the early afternoon. By the time I got there, the swelling had gone down significantly but the injection site was bright red, extremely itchy, and I was running a slight fever.  The itching at the site of injection lasted for another 24 hours after that and I was very tired and lethargic.

It is not clear if C.diff or other infectious etiology contributed to her pancytopenia or if her pancytopenia is a result of severe infection. Considering she did not have any recent insult that would have induced the C.diff infection (last chemo in Jan and no recent antibiotic use), no diarrhea prior to admission, and no CT evidence of significant colitis, I suspect her profound pancytopenia is what caused her C.diff to flare.

The time to leave was written on my paperwork. I left approximately at that time and returned home. I then began having issues with my right side including facial numbness, jaw issues, etc. A headache developed and become a migraine. I had flu like symptoms like those listed on the information regarding side effects for this vaccine and was not particularly concerned. On 02-24/2-25-2020, I was diagnosed with Complex Migraine after a ER visit that ruled out a stroke. The ER physician prescribed via pharmacy on 02-25-2020.  9 (QTY) Ondansetron ODT 4 mg tablets as needed for nausea 15 (QTY) Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 5-325 TB  I used most but not all these tablets. Per the ER instructions, I saw the Dr. on 02-26-2020 and was referred to a neurologist on this same date. Dr. prescribed:  12 (QTY) Sumatriptan 50 mg tablets A blue tablet that contains Acetaminophen. I was to take this medication if the Sumatriptan was not effective. I used some but not all of these tablets. I was given a neurology follow up appointment. I had received an automated notice of this appointment and called the office to receive information on this physician and the purpose of the appointment. I arrived on time for my appointment but there were only two staff members at the receptionist desk and it took some time to process everything. Upon entering the patient room where I was waiting, Dr. asked why I was late. I explained the waiting time and limited staff and then he indicated to a staff person to not document me as late. He then proceeded to ask me why I was there. I said I did not know. He said Dr. only sees stroke patients. He seemed insistent that I take a migraine prevention prescription even I did not meet the medical criteria for it (I did not have the number of migraines within a certain timeframe). He pointed out that one of them might reduce weight although. I was not primarily concerned about my weight and was not comfortable with a prescription that I clearly did not met the medical criteria to take. He gave no prescriptions. Due to COVID concerns, I did not return to the office and tried to limit in-person medical care to the most necessary concerns.  After having headaches that became migraines after the second COVID vaccine, I was concerned and thought it prudent to have the neurologist check on it. I saw the Dr. on 04-01-2020. At this appointment, I again stated my concern about migraines that restarted after the second vaccine. Dr. proceeded to say that he offered me a migraine prevention prescription at my last appointment, was adamant in my taking one of these prescriptions (pointing out that one of them would cause a decrease in appetite and weight loss). Again, my weight was not the primary reason for this physician visit. He again acknowledged that I did not meet the medical criteria for any of these preventative prescriptions but spoke to me as though this was the only assistance he would offer. There was no review of the prescriptions given by Dr. or offer to refill them.  I explained that I was also having numbness on my right side, facial drooping on the right side, etc. He said this was all due to Complex Migraine and that other medical concerns had been ruled out at the ER visit (02-24/2-25-2020). I did not want to make this assumption since this major onset started at the Building. He could be correct that all it attributable to Complex Migraine.  However, given my family history and other unusual symptoms, again, it seemed best to have it checked out. He seemed agitated. I pointed out this observation. He denied it and the manner and tone in which he spoke was distressing. He was adamant about preventative prescriptions. I then asked for the staff member who took my vitals. She assisted me in breathing and walking me to the door to leave. Aside from the migraines and flu like symptoms, I experience difficulty breathing, lightheadedness/faintness, weakness, etc.  There is a history of stroke, TIA, tachycardia on both sides of my family (For example, my brother had stroke TIA, tachycardia. My first cousin had three blood clots go to her brain. They are both deceased with the latter being removed from life support.). The history is extensive. I was unclear on how to report these issues for adverse effects of the Pfizer vaccine. If you could be so kind as to assist me, I would appreciate it.",,,2,04/02/2021,,Y,,

1160807,04/02/2021,WV,39.0,39,,F,,"The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist's care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.",,,,,Y,1,,,N,03/19/2021,03/25/2021,6,"3/29/21  = AST 20 3/29/21, ALT 11, CK 52,  3/28/21 = COVID19 molecular lab testing - negative, ANA serum - negative, SS-A and SS-B serum - normal, DSDNA Ab - negative, Rheumatoid factor serum - <13, Anti-SSB Ab - negative, Anti-SSB Ab quantitative - negative, Copper serum 1.02, Rheumatoid factor titer - negative, Cyclic Citrullinated peptide Ab serum - negative, Mono test - negative, HIV1/HIV2 - negative, CK total serum 39, LDH 151, Vitamin D 12,  HgA1c 4.9, Vitamin B12 290, Body Fluid Cell Count with diff -negative (2), MS profile serum and spinal - negative (0.0083), Lyme CSF 0.12, CSF culture - no growth, Protein CSF 31, Glucose CSF 65 Imaging - MRI of spine (cervical) - no stenosis or lesions, X-ray of phalangeal joints - no fracture, erosions, or inflammatory arthritis, MRI brain - normal 3/27/21 = Basic Metabolic - Sodium 137, Potassium 4.0, Chloride 104, CO2 27, Calcium 8.8, Glucose 113, BUN 8, Anion Gap 6, Creatinine 0.57, BUN/Cr ratio 14, GFR >60 HcG Pregnancy - negative, Hepatic Function Panel - Albumin 4.0, Alk Phos. 65, Bilirubin 0.4, Protein 6.5, Troponin-I <0.03, TSH 4.740, Sedimentation Rate 11, C-Reactive Protein 10.8,  CBC with diff - WBC 6.6, RBC 4.53, HGB 13.6, HCT 39.9, MCV 88.0, MCH 30.0, MCHC 34.1, RDW 12.8%, platelets 156, MPV 8.1, Neutrophil 5.60, Lymphocyte 0.50, Monocyte 0.40, Eosinophil 0.00, Basophil 0.00 Lyme Antibody panel - negative, IgA  52, ECG - sinus tachycardia/left atrial enlargement/RSR in V1 or V2, right VCD or RVH, CT brain - normal",UNK,,"Spironolactone, Nexium, Famotidine",None,None,,vsafe,2,04/02/2021,,,Y,Cephalexin

I went to Endocrinologist - and she said that it is Hashimoto's Disease. No treatment yet. I will have follow up with her this month for her to check my thyroid levels again.

He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn't use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don't sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.

She prescribed famotidine 40 mg tablets twice a day, hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg tablet once every 6 hours and a round of Prednisone in the event the itching would not stop. She said to hold off on taking the Prednisone if possible because it would neutralize the effect of the vaccine.

And pain in the upper arm, in the region between the place where the vaccine was applied and my elbow. This pain seemed to spread to the forearm. Since then, I have tingling / numbness in my left hand and forearm and pain throughout my left arm, left shoulder, upper left center of the back and neck. And these pains and numbness have been increasing every day. Ten days have passed since the vaccine was applied and the condition only worsens. I took Voltaren in the last 3 days and the pain has not subsided. I am worried and scared. Was it a case of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism? In addition, I saw in the CDC information that, during the JNJ vaccine tests, there was a case of a severe reaction called brachial neuritis; as I didn?t know what it was, I did a Google search and, apparently, the symptoms I have coincide with those of this disease. Anyway, what do you advise me to do? I have waited until now imagining that the pain and numbness would lessen. But the opposite happened and everything just makes it worse. I look forward to feedback and guidance. I haven't been to a doctor yet, but it looks like it will be necessary.

The patient stated that she had the coronavirus Pfizer vaccine and a few days later she had a black eye. The patient was concerned about this because she takes Eliquis so she asked a healthcare professional for advice they then informed her that the vaccine had caused her black eye. She was told that she cannot miss her second vaccine and that she might have to stop Eliquis. Patient was concerned about having to stop and had some questions. The patient reported that, she had been on Eliquis for a while and she had been doing just fine. She recently took the Pfizer Covid vaccine and a week or two later she developed a ""black eye"". She described the color around her eye as eggplant purple. She remembered her mother would have blood vessels burst around her eye, so at first, she thought nothing of it. She said the day before yesterday she went with her daughter while she got the Moderna Covid vaccine. She asked the nurse administering her daughters Moderna Covid vaccine if the Pfizer vaccine could cause black eyes. The patient said the nurse did some research and told her the the Pfizer vaccine was known to cause hemorrhaging, and that the vaccine caused the black eye. The nurse told the patient she should go to her HCP as soon as possible and get blood work done. The patient did not say anything else was abnormal about her blood work. She told the HCP what happened to her eye after she was given the Pfizer Covid vaccine. The HCP told her that no matter what the patient should get the second Pfizer vaccine, even if she had to stop the Eliquis for a few days. The patient said she did not want to stop the Eliquis because she has been doing wonderful on the medication and did not think the Eliquis was the cause of the black eye. She said she will have a talk with her normal primary care doctor as well as her cardiologist. The patient said she rather not get the second covid then stop the Eliquis. The patient started Eliquis two years ago after her heart went into ""full afib"" she had an ablation procedure and they shocked her heart three times to get it back into rhythm. Since starting the Eliquis the patient said her heart went back into afib one time. She wore a heart monitor and her heart went back into sinus rhythm on its own. She also mentioned that her HCP prescribed her a diuretic but she said she has a terrible reaction to it. She was prescribed the diuretic to help with the swelling around her ankles. She said the diuretic was also to help ""keep congestion from her heart"". The diuretic makes her feel ""terrible"" so her HCP allows her to cut the pill in half or quarters and take as needed to keep swelling down. She said the diuretic makes her feel faint and she even passed out one time while walking in the mall. She said she has not taken it in a while. The patient said she had a lot of allergies to medications, to many to list.

No additional patient information was provided.   Follow up information received from QA department on 27th August 2020: The reporter stated that, the healthcare center had two boxes of vaccine that had particles floating around the solution after reconstitution. Pictures were being emailed for the address provided. Two of the vaccines were administered but the office spoke to a GSK Liaison who advised that no additional doses be administered and the patients that received the vaccine should be revaccinated. No additional patient information was provided. The coordinator was contacting the healthcare provider instructing them to retain the product until they received communication from GSK concerning its retrieval. A related adverse events would be reported for the two administered vaccines. This was 1 of 2 linked cases, reported by same reporter.    Follow up information was received from QA department on 17th September 2019: Device component added for Kinrix. The complaint falls within the following product technical complaint category: vaccine appearance, based on the defect description.  A change of scope to inherent particle was made as a consequence of the Quality Control analysis of the returned samples which identified the presence of white particles. The white particles have been identified as product formulation related particles and therefore were considered as inherent to the vaccine.  Indeed, Kinrix vaccine was formulated with aluminum salt used as antigen carrier.  In some conditions, the aluminum salt could aggregate and generate some small white particles. An investigation had been conducted, including review of the reported defect trends, the returned samples, the retained samples and our production records, which had demonstrated that the subject batch was produced in compliance with the applicable procedures and met all required specifications. Moreover, the in-depth investigation performed on raw materials and at all manufacturing steps had not identified any root cause which could explain the atypical number of inherent particles observed in the syringes. Since these particles were inherent to the vaccine and based on the investigation results, data trended and safety assessment, GlaxoSmithKline was confident that there was no risk for the patient.  This complaint was considered as an isolated case.

Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that's doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that's okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn't stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can't see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn't see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She's afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She's going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she'd be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don't drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don't drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn't read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn't think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn't drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn't drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn't stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn't stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn't the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment ""I forget things and then I remember afterwards"". She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it's small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn't red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn't hurt, it's getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn't bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn't work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can't see writing, it's in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she's going blind. She's been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn't think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it ""May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn't drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression.."" She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn't get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that's the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn't know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight.

While she was in the hospital, it was discovered that she had a tumor on her thyroid. She had stayed a week in hospital. She also had a lung issue. It was discovered lots of scar tissue on lungs and according to the physician it might be from patient's lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or methotrexate. The physician said that it was caused by the methotrexate not the Humira. Methotrexate was stopped for her. Patient denied to have pulmonary fibrosis and said that according to her doctor she did not have it and she did not know her diagnosis as it was not discussed with her doctors. For problems in lungs, patient was on oxygen. Patient was off of Humira for three weeks. She had surgery on thyroid biopsy. After the surgery she was shaking a bit. She thought it was because of the anesthesia but she was fine shortly after. The biopsy results were inconclusive which looked like it was not cancerous but physician could not really tell patient if it was or it was not.

Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and other regular medication. The patient received first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and developed numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye on 26Feb2021.  It felt like she had received a lidocaine injection.  Her doctor said this can happen with RNA vaccines, affect the 7th cranial nerve and develop Bell's Palsy.  She was prescribed Valacyclovir 1mg and has taken it for 3 days.  She wants to know what the other Bell's Palsy cases were like. She wants to know what their treatments were. Her doctor said it was okay to receive her second dose at 8am on 20Mar2021 but she wants to do her due diligence and see if there is a case report or study on these patients that developed this side effect. The patient further explained that she had her first dose on 26Feb2021 and was she was there for the 15 minutes for observation. On her way home, the right side of her mouth and the right side of her nostril were numb like Novocaine that you get at the dentist. She said that the numbness traveled up the right side of her jaw to her ear and then over to her right eye. When she got home, she told her daughter and she said that she thought it was because she volunteered all day and was worn out and anxious (26Feb2021). She said that she slammed water and ate crackers and after about a 1.5 hours she started to feel better. She said that she then she called her physician and the doctor told her that it was flaring the nerve root like bells palsy and that it is a RNA Virus. She said that she was placed on some medication for it, but was wondering if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She said that the doctor asked her if she had previously had cold sores and she said yes. The caller said that her doctor said that it is exactly what that is. The patient stated that she was also short of breath on an unspecified date, but thought it was from fear and anxiousness. She does not know if it was from fear and anxiety or from the vaccine. She said that the doctor told her to take the medication 3 days before and 3 days after her second dose. She clarified that the doctor put her on Valacyclovir HCl 1Gm tablets 1 a day.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included endometriosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday (unspecified date). She thought she felt muscle spasms in the vaccinated arm, it felt like it was matching her heart rate. Her heart rate in the vaccinated arm had a mark for arrhythmia. She spoke to a family member who is a medical student, he thought it was caused by pressure on the vessel or pressure on the area. She reported having a rare form of microscopic endometriosis. She also read in a magazine that there were 36 cases of severe reactions after receiving the COVID vaccine. Not sure if it was the Pfizer COVID vaccine, but in one case, a female had heavy vaginal bleeding and her obstetrician found that she had 0 platelets although the week before her platelet count was normal. On 19Mar2021, when probed for the side effects experienced, consumer stated, ""Yesterday there was some aching in the arm but I thought perhaps the stiffness is going to be, the onset of stiffness is going to start but it didn't start as stiffness it just started progression to muscle out what I thought, muscle spasm. If I put my arm bended towards my chest that's when I would feel sort of a pop or some type of spasm and I drop my arm just like shake it off that would stop the static. When I work at my desk I keep my arm folded and today this morning is when I started to feel that the spasm in my fore arm sort of matched my heart rate a little bit and I thought do I feel my heart rate in my arm I thought that was impossible but apparently you can. I have a blood pressure check machine just to make sure I don't have high blood pressure which I have never had but I just in case you just want to check your 'vital signs'. I put that on, it also checks 'report' and your heart rate. I put it on my right arm which was the non-vaccinated arm because I didn't want to irritate inflammation in the vaccinated arm. When I put it my right arm my 'signs' they were perfectly fine and it was 118 over 66 and pulse rate 85 but I thought, you know I really need to check the arm that I felt the, that was vaccinated but I actually felt the heart beating through the arm 'is due to' muscle spasm so I put the device on that arm that was vaccinated, my left arm and when the results stopped it was completed, it was 107 over 68, 81 Pulse but then it had the notation that I had arrhythmia, I thought that here must be the heart , I don't know if it was skipping and so I thought it is a perhaps a blood clot matter but I keeping think what Pfizer had blood clot side effects so that's where I started to check and when I started to check on maybe compression or maybe inflammation I didn't want to assume blood clot so I checked for inflammation and compression. My sister's husband is a doctor, he said it sounds like Thoracic outlet syndrome and that compression but then there is like the 'veins' one which is the blood clot, then I thought man that does sound like what I have but the fact that it was involved with blood clot but let me check to see if Pfizer did have a blood issue or a blood clot matter, that's when I thought those rare side effects. I have Endometriosis (History) but I have rare type of Endometriosis that's called microscopic (not spelled) and so it travels throughout head to toe of my body and always triggers some sort of inflammatory problem that mimic other type of condition, either trigger finger arthritis and then I don't get also sensation and then it's ruled out and then I don't have it back but it mimics something that's different and that's what I am little concerned because if the vaccine attacks right there."" For treatment, consumer stated, ""I did immediately because I have heavy blood flow with Endometriosis, it's little bit frightening that the vaccine could be taking out my platelets and if I start bleeding I may just end up hemorrhaging and I went to online because the fastest thing to do on weekend, it's doing online when I did quick diagnostic to do the complete blood count to check my platelet numbers are okay so I just ran to the store that has a blood diagnostic and they were closing so I explained to them my concern about maybe having ITP and they could be attacking my platelets and if they could just you know stumbles it  later and draw the blood they did so I am waiting that may take a day to receive the results.""

Took Tylenol every 4 hours all day long - fever, chills and headache did not stop.  Had to spend all day in bed, could not eat, had to get someone to take care of my children - literally could not stay awake or function.  Next day I woke up feverish and with a mild headache, Tylenol worked and I was able to function although I did not feel completely well.  At night the fever came back and also pain in the back of the neck.  Fever was not as bad as the day before.  Today, Woke up with headache, tylenol worked and I am functional.  No fever.    The pain at site injection is reseeding; it was sore and lymph nodes of arm pit are still swollen but it does not bother me.  The other symptoms were scary.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/30/2021,03/31/2021,1,N/A,OTH,,Candesartan HCT 16-12.5mg;  Vitamin D 2000 u,N/A,Hypertension,,,2,04/02/2021,,,,"Allergies- latex, aspirin"
