I have a history of Dysautonomia and Anxiety. The dysautonomia has been controlled with lifestyle modifications for over 5 years. Symptoms experienced with it include low blood pressure, tachycardia, pre syncopal feelings and syncope. The occurrence of these symptoms became more frequent after receiving my second vaccination. In addition to above symptoms, my anxiety has worsened (which has been well controlled on the same medication for over 5 years), more syncopal episodes, acute weight loss, increased fatigue, lower baseline blood pressure, hair loss, temperature instability, and intermittent chest heaviness.   In June, I had a dental procedure in which local epinephrine and lidocaine was used.  I drove myself as I was told this would not be an issue since nitrous or general anesthesia was not used. I left the appointment to drive 20 minutes home. Within 5 minutes of my house, I began with pre-syncopal feelings (dizziness, blurred vision, pounding headache). I pulled off on side of road and within seconds, I had loss consciousness. I was by myself so unsure as to how long before I regained consciousness. When I woke up, I notified  my spouse. I noted that I had loss bowel and bladder control during this episode, which has never occurred during my syncopal episodes. My foot was also cut from the foot pedals. My spouse said it took approximately 45 minutes for me to return to baseline. This episode was concerning for seizure activity, in which I will be evaluated by a Neurologist.

1464116,07/12/2021,OH,58.0,58,,F,,"Two concerns may indicate under/invalid dose administered.   1) Location of injection was low side of arm & may have missed muscle.   2) Immediately after injection, clear fluid leaked out of arm, beaded up and trickled down. Nurse wiped away and it repeated leaking a second time. I asked if enough dose remained to be effective she replied ""I hope so ...but I don't really know"" then she left. A second nurse arrived and told us we could leave without 15 minute wait if we felt fine. I asked what to do about my leaky, off target dose, and was given phone number to report to VAERS, which I called same day, but VAERS said they only report adverse symptoms not administration problems. It was suggested I notify health dept and vaccine facility, who in turn suggested a different health dept, who in turn suggested  covid vaccine info line, who in turn suggested my PCP.  My PCP advised me to go back to clinic and get re-vaccinated.  That clinic no longer exists, so my PCP then said go to any, which I attempted, but when I did I was refused because they view me as already technically dosed, if not actually dosed.  I contacted PCP a third time, and they said I should consider myself as single dosed only, I should continue masking, social distancing etc., until I get re-vaccinated or receive a booster in the autumn.  He indicated that they would not give me a written authorization because they didn?t administer the questionable shot.  He did suggest I could lie about having received a second dose and they would give me the dose.  I thought this wrong so I gave up for a while.    I am at risk for severe complications of Covid-19 due to a long history of lung problems, lung collapse, pneumonia, irregular heartbeat, age 59, etc., and I am also a caregiver for my 91 year old mother.  Due to partially vaccinated status I must still live an isolated, masked up life. It bothers me greatly when I should have received a vaccine I could be confident of.  Recently I called Pfizer to see if perhaps they could offer information and help.   They suggested I phone CDC again about invalid/under dose vaccine administration.  I did, and CDC indicated VAERS should have taken my report when I called them, and CDC encouraged me to report it by on-line form, in hope that I may yet receive a proper second dose.   While unlikely that the shot I received on April 6th was a full dose, it is conceivable I got a partial dose.  I do not wish an overdose, but I have learned that the doses in trials were much higher without problems, and it has also been almost four months since that botched dose was given to me, and I know boosters are common in many vaccines without posing undue risk of overdose.  This must be weighed against the risks of my possibly contracting Covid-19.  It is also pertinent that I live in a anti-mask, anti-vaccine part of the world, making my exposure risks even greater.  I?m no shrinking violet, but a recent visit to my doctor?s office for skin cancer follow up was unnerving, as I was squeezed into the little exam room along with nurses, a student, and the doctor, and none wore masks and only one had been vaccinated.

1464261,07/12/2021,OH,40.0,40,,M,,"Following my second Pfizer dose on on 4/2/21 I began having a strong burning pain in my right forearm and wrist area. I perceived this initially to be carpal tunnel and it started on 4/5/21. I self treated with ibuprofen for a few days with no improvement, then saw my PCP on 4/9.  My PCP thought this to be tenosynivitis, and prescribed Methylprednislone. The steroid treatment helped for the first few days but then the pain quickly spread to my right leg in the thigh area. Same type of pain, burning and intense. I was able to walk, but with a slight limp.  I saw my PCP again on 4/15 to discuss the new symptoms. He began researching possible conditions and also ordered some blood tests for common auto-immune diseases (Uric Acid, C-Reactive Protein, CMP, ANA). Everything returned normal except for C-Reactive (value- 50+). To be sure it wasn?t a case of septic arthritis, I was placed on an antibiotic on 4/17 (Keflex) for 7 days.  The Keflex did not help and actually gave me a slight fever (100.1) and I missed work on 4/19,20,21. I started to improve on 4/16 but the symptoms were still present.  As a followup, my PCP ordered a more comprehensive blood panel to be reviewed at my next appointment on 4/30. The following blood tests were ordered: TSH 3rd Gen Blood, CBC, CMP (BAMP, TP ALB TBIL,ALK, AST, ALT), and LIPID Panel.   On PCP appointment on 4/30, my symptoms continued to present in legs and right arm. All values from blood tests were normal. He ordered a lower back xray, which was scheduled for 5/11. At this point, my PCP referred me to a rheumetologist as he had exhausted his options.  Unfortunately, the earliest rheumatology available was 5/18.  On 5/18 appointment with rheumatology resulted in more tests: Parvovirus B19, Rheumatoid Factor, Serum Protein Electrophoresis, Urine PRotein/Creatinine Ratio, Immunoglobulin Assay-Blood, Immunofixation Procedure Blood, ASO- Blood, CPK Blood, Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antb, Hep B Surface AG, Hep C AB- Blood, Microalbumin urine random. All tests read as negative or normal except ASO.  Rheumetologist referred me to Infectious Disease for further testing on 5/26, which resulted in the following blood tests: Ehrlichia Chaffeensis AB IGG, DNASE B Antibody, HLA Typing A B C Single - Blood, Legionnella -Blood, Prostate Specific Antigen, Unrinanalysis with Microscopic, Chlamydia and GC RNA AMP, Upper respiratory throat culture. He also ordered an ECG, a chest XRAY (PA and Lateral), CT scan of the pelvis. On 6/4 at a followup appointment, he ordered Crypto AG and C-Reactive Protein. At this point, CRP value was 180.74.  I worked my last day of work on 5/14 as the pain became too intense to manage. As the week progressed, I slowly lost my ability to walk and care for myself. I could walk only 10-15 feet at a time, and doing so would cause a severe flare-up of pain in my legs. I was mostly bedridden for 2 weeks starting on 5/20 and was only getting up very minimally. I needed a wheelchair for transport to my appointments on 5/25, 5/26, 6/2, 6/3. By 6/4, I was barely able to walk to that appointment, but the office is very small so I was able to make a short distance.  My rheumetologist, having reviewed all my normal test results ordered an EMG on my legs and right arm and also an MRI on my lumbar and cervical.  EMG conducted on 6/24 and revealed some nerve damage and signs of neuropathy in my legs; and also carpal tunnel in the right wrist.  MRI Lumbar (6/25) revealed some common lower back issues, but nothing affecting the nerves that may be the cause of my symptoms. MRI Cervical (7/12) completed but yet to be analyzed.   As of today, July 12, I?m feeling much improved over how I felt in early June. I can walk a short distance of ? mile without needing a break. I have lost muscle tone and need to work on getting my strength back. My right arm has minimal pain but will flareup with heavy computer usage.  However, for the past 2 weeks, my left arm (which has been symptom free since April) now has a similar burning pain that starts at the funnybone of the elbow and runs up to my wrist. The pain comes and goes but is sometimes very intense and can be debilitating. It is hard for me to open some doors with this hand or even hold a heavy cup of water.  As a previously healthy person, and having done exhaustive testing, myself and my PCP believe I had a rare and negative reaction to the vaccine.",,,,,,,,Y,N,04/02/2021,04/05/2021,3,"4/15/21 - Uric Acid, C-Reactive Protein, CMP, ANA = all normal/negative except CRP (value 50)  4/26/21 - TSH 3rd Gen Blood, CBC, CMP (BAMP, TP ALB TBIL,ALK, AST, ALT), and LIPID Panel. = all normal  5/11/21 - Lumbar Xray = normal for age and condition, not believe to affect current symptoms  5/18/21 - Parvovirus B19, Rheumatoid Factor, Serum Protein Electrophoresis, Urine PRotein/Creatinine Ratio, Immunoglobulin Assay-Blood, Immunofixation Procedure Blood, ASO- Blood, CPK Blood, Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antb, Hep B Surface AG, Hep C AB- Blood, Microalbumin urine random.

Three more times this happened, with heat going from feet to head (numbness in feet).  Each heart rate was progressively lower with each incidence.  Then it stopped. This was in the afternoon and by evening felt ok.   The 14th, the same thing happened but only 3 times and with hr incidents starting at 123.  Then fine again.  The morning of the 15th started again, so I went to urgent care appointment in the afternoon. By this time, my heart rate was up and down..  They ran an EKG and it was fine, just showing rapid heart rate. But I was sent to the ER for further tests.  At  ER another EKG, chest x-ray and blood work.  Only item of significance was an elevated TSH.  At this point, my heart rate was going up and down (I had a finger monitor so I could watch it).  I'll note at this point, the heart rate was random but I was able to walk. Over the next week or so, hr got worse and positional. When I stood up, it would sky rocket to the 140s.  I became shaky, developed brain fog, nausea, feeling like I was going to fall over and felt only well laying down or sitting.  I visited my primary who initially thought anxiety but as symptoms were getting worse (I could no longer do anything: walk farther than from the living room to the kitchen, do simple tasks while standing or sitting - hr would increase while doing activities even while sitting, and no longer drive).My doctor decided it was more than anxiety when I was continuing to have symptoms that looked like POTS. I have been to the cardiologist - she  did a 24 holter and EKG - no significance, but decided my heart was not the primary cause of the positional heart rate increase.  I am due for an echocardiogram this week - just to make sure but she did not think that was the issue. An MRI this week, recommended by my neurologist. and have done preliminary blood work/urinalysis for possible endocrine issues - all that have come back normal so far (but seeing an endocrinologist next month anyway).  I currently am seeing functional neurologist who has diagnosed me with dysautonomia  (so far of unknown reasons) - he is helping me with the heart rate issue (POTS) and other symptoms that have developed over the weeks like electrical zaps throughout my body - some sort of neruopathy. I was in great health until this shot.  I had not even had a cold since January of 2020.  I may have hypothyroidism but it has been managed with some ups and downs in TSH for the last 20 years with no other issues.   Some of my doctors do not correlate the shot to my problem but some have.

We administered Rotavirus and PCV-13 with correct vaccinations, however we inadvertently administered Kinrix (DTap-IPV) instead of Pediarix (DTap-HepB-IPV) or Pentacel (DTap-HIB-IPV). Kinrix is approved for children 4-6 years of age whereas Pediarix is approved for children 6 weeks of age - 6 years of age, and Pentacel is approved for 6 weeks - 4 years of age.  Kinrix: GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, 0.5 mL intramuscular injection of DTap/IPV  This mistake of administering Kinrix was made due to lack of information on vaccine packaging (it did not provide age ranges on the box or in the package insert) and my human error. After reviewing CDC and vaccination guidelines/information on this event, it was found that this would not be harmful to the babies, the brand was just not tested/approved for children at 4 months old. It was the same dosage as the other, approved vaccines for their age with the same content being administered for DTap and IPV to immunize the twins.  The information for the vaccines administered were entered in the patient's chart, Kinrix was documented as out of age range, transmitted to the registry, and I have reached out to registry to ensure that this would be approved on his immunization record toward his immunization status (it is dependent on the individual's state guidelines). The parents were notified of this event on 6/23, and I explained to them everything that happened and ensured them of the safety of their children. I apologized for this human error and made sure they were on the same page with all their questions and concerns.  They were monitored closely and did not have any adverse reactions to this vaccine and it was confirmed by our state guidelines and immunization nurse through registry that this will count toward the twins' immunization status.  We took measures to prevent this from happening in the future by labelling the boxes to make it very clear that Kinrix is for 4-6 year olds and Pediarix is 6 weeks-6 years and Pentacel is 6 weeks-4 years. We also created a schedule for immunization based on the vaccines we have in our office clearly marking for each age range and vaccine type required.

Taking meds 3 to 4 times a day (pepcid and antihistamine).     Had swelling in the ankle which the doctor said basically hives gone crazy.   Then the hives got worse - and itching.   Covered most of my body.    The hives on the bottom of the feet felt like walking on air pillow packaging material.    Dr puts me back on steroids.    Go through this process twice with steroids.    Dr said we would have to go the route of Xolair.   Received first injection three weeks ago.    But after shot had bad hives again with itching this time  - more steroids.     Then things sort of leveled out - still had hives but not a large - and no itching _ thank goodness.     But then on 7-2-21 I woke up with severe swelling of the face - and into the throat.    Had difficulty swallowing.    Back to emergency room again - more shots and Epinephrine.     They prescribe more steroids and epi pen just in case because the reaction was so severe.    Second shot of Xolair is in one more week - hopefully gets things under control.",,,,,,,,,N,04/01/2021,04/05/2021,4,,PUB,,"Verapamil, iron 60 mg, multivitamin, Saw palmetto",None,High blood pressure,,,2,07/12/2021,,Y,Y,None

No significant symptoms happened after the 1st dose.  However, there were reactions after the 2nd dose.  Right after the 2nd dose, that night and the 2 days after, I had high fevers in the range of 100.4 to 101.5.  I also had significant episodes of chills, i.e. feeling uncontrollably cold and shivering, even though I was having high fevers.  Afterwards the fevers and the chills subsided.  I thought all was OK again, and no big deal.  However, on May 01, 2021; I experienced significant chest pain on the left side of the chest (near the heart area).  I could not figure out what caused the pain as I did not have any heavy physical activities.  I thought I had indigestion, but the heart-burn medicine did not help.  As the chest pain intensified, and my blood pressure climbing up to around 125 / 70 to 127 / 70 (my typical normal blood pressure was about 95 / 65),  I was afraid of having a heart attack, so at around 7 PM, I went to the Urgent Care facility, Patient First, in.  They told me that I should go to a Hospital ER.  So, around 8 PM, I went. There they did a lot of tests, and told me I did not have a heart attack nor blood clots, but I had some bad inflammation of unknown pathology.  They also said my EKG had changes and they were concerned because of that change, but they could not figure out the reason.  The ER doctor ordered and I was given an injection of a strong anti-inflammatory medicine.   After keeping me there until almost 2 AM to 3 AM of the following early morning, they discharged me when the symptoms reduced.  I remembered, about 30 minutes after receiving the injection of the anti-inflammatory medicine, the chest pain got lessened, and my heart pressure went back down to about 115 / 70 (It was 127/70 when I checked into the ER).  All in all, it was a really scary event for me that night.  At first, I did not associate this event with the COVID-19 vaccine.  However, after reading many news articles about the possibility of COVID-19 vaccine-induced heart inflammation, I believed I should report this adverse reaction (chest pain) event, and all other adverse reactions I experienced, to the system.

She remained in the hospital for four days.  2) On Sunday, July 4th, patient was at home on the ventilator.   Approximately 1:30 pm she seemed to become somewhat tired and she dropped her coffee cup.A little later, while eating, she threw up, spilling food and drink on her top. She seemed more tired and needed help changing her top. She sat in her recliner for a while and then she had to go to the bathroom. I took her there in a wheelchair. By the time she was ready to leave the bathroom, she was comatose and I had to lift her, she was dead weight, and place her in the wheelchair.  I rolled her to the recliner and lifted her into it.  She was then completely unconscious, with a continuously running nose and bubbles and fluid coming from her mouth ! Note: This was exactly same experience we had with her on May  12th 2021, when she was taken to hospital.   I increased her breath rate on the Vent from 16 to 20, hoping that would expel CO2. I also increased the oxygen setting on the floor concentrator to 9, her pulse oxy was stable at 90. With the help of my daughter in law and grandson, we repositioned her on the recliner to a more comfortable and accessible position, connected the AMBU bag to the oxygen and slowly applied oxygen through her trach connection.  We had also called the emergency, requesting assistance. By slowly squeezing the AMBU bag, I got her oxygen up to 100 ! Note: This Is exactly what we did on May 12 th.  The ENT?s arrived shortly and within a few minutes after they arrived, patient started to come out of her comatose condition. The ENT?s checked her vitals,(somewhat normal) did an EKG, and checked her CO2 (45).We spoke to the doctor, and by that time she was acting ?normal? ! The decision was made to keep her at home instead of going to the hospital and an at-home X-ray was ordered in case she aspirated and conducted the following day.

On Monday 08 Feb 2021, patient called her PCP, and had a zoom call. She prescribed a cough med and suggested I get a chest xray and Ct scan. The medication helped a bit with the cough (especially at night) but she still had mucus production. Patient had another call with PCP on 16Feb 2021, where she prescribed a five day course of antibiotic, but that didn't result in clearing up the mucus production either. Patient was but on an inhaler to help clear up the likely infection/mucus. Patient had little to no (new) symtoms as a result of the 2nd shot. Patient used the inhaler for about two months and gradually the mucus production and cough went away. Patient weaned myself off the inhaler over the course of the first 2-3 weeks in May and was perfectly fine until she went in to have the pneumonia vaccine (PPSV-23) on 13 Jun 2021. After the shot patient's mucus production started up again and patient started back on the inhaler but only once a day, which seems to keep my symptoms in check. Patient met PCP on 29 Feb 2021, to talk about this on-going lung issue. Patient was going to take a pulmonary Function Test some time this month (July).

She stated it is on the front and back of her neck and it happened as soon as she got the vaccine. The dermatologist does not think it was from the vaccine because it is not systemic. She stated maybe the vaccine triggered the allergic reaction. Her neck was itching like insane. She was given cortisone cream for this. She asked if this itching was from the vaccine and how long it would last. She stated she was supposed to go for a mammogram on Monday. But an article is saying if you get the vaccine you should not get a mammogram for a month because it can show inflammation of lymph nodes which can be a symptom of breast cancer. This came out of breast imaging source. She was concerned about that. You should wait at least a month because you can have axillary lymph node swelling and that can show up on a mammogram. She stated so I don't want to do a mammogram. The caller stated she had friends with fatigue, chills, and sore arms. The caller asked if they should wait to get a mammogram after getting the vaccine because of the potential for swollen lymph nodes If so, how long should they wait.

She already answered questions and she got a thing, but no one answers, no one calls. She does not want to document her experience. She wants to number in case we get disconnected.

The patient medical history included cholesterol, blood pressure, heart problem in the valve (found that three years ago), minuet heart murmur (did good with the test three years ago, all this time she was fine, she knew she had a little heart murmur). The patient concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (20mg once a day; taking the lowest dose, had been on it maybe five or six years) taken for cholesterol, amlodipine (10mg once a day; had been on it for 10 years or more) for blood pressure. Investigation assessment was not provided. A nurse told the patient that she should have called in and mentioned what happened when the patient got the COVID shot. On 31Jan2021 (which was a Sunday), the patient and her husband went in the institute and got the first shot. Her husband went into the hospital on Monday 01Feb2021. She couldn't see him until that Friday. On 05Feb2021 (that Friday) when the patient started to visit him, she got chest pain under her armpits across the chest and across the shoulders. It felt like someone punched her in the back. She was walking to his hospital room and she had to sit down twice because she couldn't make it. She was not normally like that.

They had found that three years ago. She had a minuet heart murmur, and she did good with the test three years ago. All this time she was fine. She knew she had a little heart murmur and now it was a big problem. When she was in there, they wouldn't put her on the treadmill and did other tests and then they sent her home. She had to see the cardiologist and she might have to have heart surgery (as therapeutic measure for chest pain). The chest pain started on 05Feb2021. It felt like elephant on the chest. She really felt it when walking in the hospital on 05Feb2021 (that Friday). It was still here and like that. She didn't want to go get it. She was scared. She asked them to use the other arm because her left arm was sore on an unspecified date in 2021. She had never had a cardiologist before because she did so well before and the heart murmur was so minuet. Her primary care had said at that time she didn't need a cardiologist. Monday, she will be meeting with the cardiologist. She went for a stress test 04Mar2021 (yesterday) and stress test was done with the cardiologist. She met him first on 04Mar2021 (yesterday) after the stress test. Her appointment was Monday at 14:00 and that was to find out how bad this was.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm, at age 64 years, on 12Mar2021 08:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation, she did not want to catch COVID and she have not had COVID but she was an essential worker and she wanted protection. Medical history included high cholesterol and blood pressure high controlled by medication, and coronary artery disease from unspecified dates. Concomitant medications included losartan taken for hypertension; and pravastatin taken for blood cholesterol increased; all start and stop date were not reported. Patient stated that she was fortunate enough to get an appointment for a Pfizer COVID shot on 12Mar2021, 08:50 in the morning and sat down, had the shot. The shot was painless. They said that you needed to go to an area for 15 minutes so that they could keep an eye on you and see if you have any reactions and so at about patient would say maybe 5 to 8 minutes in sitting calmly, all of a sudden, she started showing sort of like feeling light headed and then began a very strong headache. So, patient started feeling out of thought and then I realized that her heart was racing and she wasn't feeling well. By the time they gave the time and make sure the time of and they said you need to identify if you are not feeling well, we will come talk to you. So when the 15 minutes was over she wanted to see if it is going to happen again or is it going to subside. But it didn't. She approached the woman with her timer and she said that she don't feel well and she got some issue going on that she don't know. She was perfectly fine when she was walking this morning so, she said come over, come back, have a seat, let's take your blood pressure. So they came over and her blood pressure she would say in about a normal basis is usually about 136/76 that it was last time taken. It is a little elevated and she does take medication. But she was telling that her blood pressure was shot through the roof. Her blood pressure went up to 189/102 and the medical staff in the (Facility name) where she got the appointment went crazy. They said you sit down one moment we have to get a team here, so a team with a stretcher and all kinds of medical equipment said to me might have to get you to ER right now and she was like she knew pretty elevated and she felt awful but she don't really know what to do and they said let's take your vital and then they that group that came in probably from an ambulance said let's take your blood pressure again. So they did both arms several times and it is still that elevated. For a period of time it was holding that number and they said we could take you to emergency room or you can have your husband can take you. It is up to you. And patient said that she really have to go and they said you are in danger and you are in dangerous number. So her husband took her to the ER and they did a lot of blood work upon her and everything trying to get the blood pressure down and they gave her some TYLENOL for her headache and they finally her something that can help hopefully bring her numbers down which as of today (at the time of report on 13Mar2021) she  think it was down to like 160 which is still too high for her. So she was working on that but it concerned her and she don't know if anyone has had that, have they had a reaction. But what concerns her is she had to take a second shot to be fully covered and so she said to the doctor in the ER, should she be taking the second shot and he said yes, sure. So it is concerning her me and she don't know if Pfizer have advice for that. She have not been able to get in touch with her primary care doctor but she thought because the make up of the vaccine, she wanted to touch a brief with Pfizer first. She was concerned that it could happen to her again to shoot back up if she take the second shot. But she was more worried or equally worried about not having the 2nd shot, she need that covered, she don't want to stop probably the in succession. She also stated that she believes that it was a nurse that gave her the first dose of vaccine in her right arm. Patient stated that she was put on an IV and took a full blood work up and they came back and said her my blood work was great. There wasn't any problem. Other treatment for events was Baby aspirin 81mg to help blood flow. Patient stated that she have a headache still, she was more clear because it did come down, its not down where it should be down at its normal range. She have a very slight light headedness, but heart racing stopped. She also stated that interesting thing was it is very strong in the beginning but it sort of subside a little bit and then it will come back, it was sort of like it was on more than off. The first day, yesterday most of times, it was hurting quite a bit, like days were on, she had the episodes, it wasn't there and all of a sudden it come back. She woke up this morning with it, she would say its still there but it was much less intense then it was yesterday and early morning today at the time of report on 13Mar2021.

On 31 Mar2021 caller is reporting regarding side effects from the Pfizer Vaccine. She got it at the Center. She clarifies it is the covid vaccine. She has a sheet that says it was manufactured by Pfizer Biotech, it has a fact sheet, and it says emergency use authorization to prevent Covid-19 in those 16 and older. First, she had the injection into her left upper arm yesterday at around 1430 to 1500. Her appointment was around 1400 and by the time she got it, it was past 1400. Immediately after nothing happened. It happened mostly after she came back home within a half hour to an hour. Within 2 hours she had aches and pains in her whole body, something as if somebody had beaten her up. Her arm, her upper arm mostly, where she got the injection is stiff. It is very painful, and she has some redness around the injection site. She also has a rash that started around her belly and is now in different parts of her body. She also has muscle aches. She had a very strange feeling yesterday within 2 hours or after, she started to have headaches. It was more like a flushing in her head. It was as if her head was kind of not able to focus and with some pain like a headache. She also had nausea and vomited once. She took an antihistamine over the counter, something like Claritin, because she also felt a bit short of breath. She did taker her pulse ox and it was around 92-93 yesterday. Today it improved after taking Claritin. So today she still has the rash and her whole body is aching, she still has a headache, and her arm is really sore, and she can't move it. She asks to have that written down, she can't move her arm near the shoulder and it really aches. It is not like the injection, she didn't have it right away, it was within an hour or so, or within 2 or 3 hours she started having the aches and pains. Reporter prefers her main contact to be by email. Her phone is not reliable, and she is in and out of the place where she is living. She declines to give her mailing address right now. She would rather stick with email right now; it would probably be the best way to do that. She has a question. Does she have to be seen by a doctor. She, as a medical doctor, doesn't think she has to go to the emergency room. Her symptoms have improved, and she has no acute chest pain. Her pulse ox dipped yesterday, but today it is better. Her shortness of breath is definitely better today after she started the antihistamine. She asks if we by law have to say that she needs to go to the physician. The weather is bad where she is, and they are having snow there. All health facilities and doctors are overwhelmed right now with the Covid situation. She improved with the antihistamine and will try to make an appointment as soon as possible. She obviously took an anti-inflammatory. Her headache is still there. She will keep taking the anti-inflammatory and the antihistamine. She does have, if we want, the code number where they registered her at the vaccination center. She got the vaccine there in the (vaccination center name) in (location). She has to say this, she hasn't visited a general doctor in a long time and will have to call in in order to make an appointment with one. In the past she saw a doctor, her name was (Dr. name) with the (hospital name). She also has seen an ENT before. She doesn't have contact information for Dr. (name). We can probably pull her up, she used to practice in (location). She is not on a lot of medications recently. She has been on some medications because of Covid prophylaxis. She is on an antihypertensive, Zinc, and Concor for heart rate. The Concor is Bisoprolol. She took that before she had the vaccine. She has been on it for more than a year, almost 2 years or so. Her muscles literally feel as if they've been beaten up. It mostly started yesterday. She slept and wanted to rest. She started feeling the aches and pains 3-4 hours after she got the vaccine and then this morning it was really pronounced. Patient received treatment with Tylenol for the pain, an anti-inflammatory, and Claritin. All the medications that she takes will expire after 2023, way after 2021. She pays attention to all food and medication expiration dates. She is trying to see where the lot is on her Tylenol. She can't see very well. They have code that is like a purchase code but not a lot number. There is a barcode thing but because of the carton it is not very clear. It is hard to see the numbers. She is not going to be able to give product information for the Tylenol. She did take Claritin yesterday when she felt there was something going on with the pain and not breathing very well. She forgot this could have an anti-allergic affect. Claritin has an antihistamine effect. If she were to provide any information for any medications, she would have to get her magnifier. Right now, she is taking Bisoprolol 5mg in the morning. She is taking Aspirin Protect Bayer 100mg, she takes one every day. She is taking Zinc 50mg, one in the morning and one in the afternoon as an immune boost and against viruses. She takes Vitamin C 1000mg, she breaks it in half and takes one half in the morning and one half in the afternoon. Those are the main medications. The Bisoprolol is used as an antihypertensive and slows the heart rate. She started having fevers of more than 100.5. She also started having pains, generalized pains all over her body mostly on her left upper arm. This seems to have started the same day a few hours after the vaccine. Everything started a few hours after the vaccine. She came back and slept early; she really wasn't feeling well. When she woke up in the morning and still had the symptoms and the rash. Her aches improved a little after taking Tylenol and Aspirin. She believes she took Advil as well and anti-inflammatories. In the morning she woke up and was still having it. After she ate, she took another Tylenol. She also took Claritin. The shortness of breath also started yesterday but when she took Claritin it did improve in the morning. Her fever improved after the Tylenol. She still has nausea and an upset stomach. She vomited once yesterday. This morning she didn't vomit but is still not feeling like she needs to eat because of her upset stomach. She is nauseous like her whole stomach is not receptive. Even when drinking water, she can only take a few sips. Her pulse ox was dipping from 91-92 today. With the Claritin it might have improved. Because her pulse ox is better right now, she didn't go to the emergency room. She knows that anything below 94 should get medical attention in the emergency room or something. Right now, she is 94, 95, 96 range. Her throat is not clear, every so often she has to swallow saliva and kind of like clears her throat in order to free her situation. Her pulse ox right now is okay. Her upper arm hasn't improved. She can't put weight on her arm of lift anything. She has the rash on her legs and abdomen. It more not only at the site of the injection but around her skin in general. It is itching and feels like she needs to itch. It started yesterday. She noticed it mostly this morning. She wants to convince herself that it is getting better. Her headaches are not like regular headaches, it is more a feeling like her head is heavy and kind of flushed and with pain. It did improve a bit with Tylenol. Except for the medications she is taking, she does have a contact allergy to nickel. She can't wear costume jewelry because her skin breaks out immediately. In a few hours her skin breaks out at the site where she wears custom jewelry. She also has a partial lactase deficiency. She can't eat a lot of milk or dairy products. She can have small amounts like partial. The allergy to nickel has been a long time, since she was young. Right now, she is 56-57, she was born in 1964. She has always had that when she tried to wear jewelry since she was a teenager. The lactase deficiency also definitely started when she was young since childhood. She was born with these things; they were not acquired allergies. She has not had any tests recently. She did have some sort of testing done like a head CT and a chest X-ray; she believes it was definitely more than 2 years ago. She has had nothing recent. They were normal.  Time the Vaccination Was Given Her appointment being 1400. It was a little past 1400, she wasn't looking at the hour. It was between 2 and 3 by the time she was seated, and they prepared. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: This was her first dose. She needed to wait a little, but they were advertising for the fact that they were not giving the Pfizer version anymore in the center. She figured the data on the Pfizer is the best, so she tried to get it before they changed the type of vaccine. She was thrilled by the results and effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine. She will be trying to make an appointment. The weather is very bad there. Because she is in the medical field, she has been observing herself. If things get worse, she will go to the emergency room, otherwise she will try to make an appointment with the doctor. She has no transportation; she would have to take the bus or a taxi. She will have to see what to do. She asks if there are any pamphlets or forms that she should expect to get by mail or email. She says she would like to document these things as it is something she will have to follow up on and it is important to check. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 100.5 on 31Mar2021, head CT: normal 2 years ago.

It's nearly time for my 2nd shot (coming up this Saturday) and for the past two or three days, my arm has been hurting at the injection site.  Pain was getting severe so I stretched (followed a 5 minute routine from a video), and now it is _very_ painful. Seems to have made it worse. I did the same routine in my other arm, but it feels fine.  The pain is very weird - I have no idea what muscle has the problem. I can lift my left arm above my head without any pain, and I can point it straight in front of me without any pain. I can carry something quite heavy without any pain at all. However, if I lean forward, there is some of the worst pain I have ever felt in my life at my upper forearm where I think I was injected. It has gotten worse the past day, and woke me up from sleep. It's uncomfortable / nearly impossible for me to lean over to pick something up, even from a table.  I have no bruises nor lumps or bumps from the vaccine though. Honestly I'm really not sure if this is from the vaccine or from something else, but I have not lifted anything heavy (except grocery bags, yesterday), and have not stressed my arm in any weird way that the other arm hasn't been stressed (from stretching).  Am not sure if I should get the second shot at this point; am considering seeing my doctor, but so far have not contacted him about this. I'm hoping it just goes away on its own.  Must stress that the pain I feel when leaning forward is some of the most intense pain I have ever felt - and I have had both eardrums rupture at once and passed out before.

A 50-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second single dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 19Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) for covid-19 immunisation at age of 50-year-old. The patient previously received fist single dose of bnt162b2 on 22Mar2021 (Lot: ER8727) at left upper arm at age of 50-year-old and having a problem with her arm. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. She took no medications at all. She stated she was usually pretty healthy. The patient reported a ""jibby jabby"" pain on her left arm in Apr2021, the same arm where she got the vaccine. She said that she cannot move her left arm because of the ""unbelievable pain"" that even made her cry in May2021. She described the pain as something intense that she cannot get dress, brush her hair or even apply a deodorant. She later visited an orthopedic specialist and calcium deposits was found on the rotor cap of her tendon. Her physician recommended that she got an ultrasound shot for today's appointment. However, findings showed that her arm was healing and that her physician did not see the need to proceed with the ultrasound shot. In line with this, caller would like to know if it is normal that this side effect has been on-going for 2 months since she last got the shot on 19Apr2021. She described that on some days it gets better but it is just this May that it felt a lot worse. Patient reported she may have a side effect from the Pfizer, but she was not sure. She went and got her first Pfizer shot on 22Mar2021 and she has been having a problem with her arm. The second shot was on 19Apr2021. She stated she did not really get sick from the Pfizer shot at the time, but ever since she got the shot, her arm had never been the same. She complained about it every day, it was sore, She stated she kept getting jibby jabs in in Apr2021, she did not know how to describe it, other than jibby jabby pain. She still got pain. She clarified her arm was still sore where she had the vaccine in in Apr2021, her arm had never been the same. At the end of May2021, she was still having problems with it. Her arm got so bad, she could not move it for 3 days, and she actually thought she was having a stroke. She had to actually pick up her arm and move it. She could not get dressed. She could not wash her hair. She cried. She went to the hospital and as she was sitting there, she told them she felt like the pain was spreading all the way up her arm. She wanted to know if this was from the vaccine. She explained the hospital did not know. They took an x-ray, but did not find anything in her arm. They referred her to an orthopedic doctor. She stated it has been like 24 days since she went to the first orthopedic doctor, and he told her she had a calcium deposit on her tendon/rotator cuff. She had to go get some ultrasound shots to have it broke up. She had to call and make an appointment because she had to go see another orthopedic doctor for the shots. Her appointment was today and when she went there, it seemed like her arm was getting a little bit better, so the doctor said he was not going to do the shots. The doctor said he did not want to shoot the shots into her if she was not in pain already. She was wondering if this pain in her arm came from the COVID vaccine shot because her arm had never been this painful. Even though they found the calcium deposit, she still got pain where the vaccine was, at the injection site. She still had pain that shoots down her arm. Even though she guessed the calcium deposit was healing, they never said anything about the vaccine. The patient stated she thought it was coming from the vaccine because her arm had never been the same. She added that she gained a lot of weight with the lock down. She said she went running to the hospital because she was so scared. She could not wash her hair and move her arm for a few days, so she was not sure if it was coming from the vaccine. The caller explains her sister kind of forced her into the vaccine. She kept telling her sister that she was not ready for the COVID vaccine because it was not FDA approved yet, but her sister forced her into it. She kept telling her sister that her arm hadn't been the same after the vaccine. Her arm still wasn't the same, she still got pains in it. The patient said it was hard to describe the pain in her arm. The patient said sometimes it felt like something was in there jibby jabbing her. Sometimes, pain just shoots through her arm. She could not move her arm for days. She could not wash her hair or anything. She could not lift it. She went running to the hospital and was told they did not know what it was, and then she asked if it was from the vaccine and they said they did not know. So, they sent her to the orthopedic doctor. As she stated earlier, the doctor found a calcium deposit, but she did not know if that was part of the vaccine. She just knew her arm still hurts at the injection site where she got the vaccine and her arm has never been the same, it still was not to this day. She still got pain in it. She kept hoping it would go away, but it still had not. The day after she got the second vaccine, her arm started hurting. It was really sore the next day and she knew it was supposed to be. The pain started too but she didn't think much of it. She figured it was because she just got the shot. It seems like it is still there and now she has the issue with the orthopedics and calcium deposits. She does not know if the calcium deposit could be coming from the vaccine because she was told it was from the tendon/ rotator cuff. However, she knows she still feels pain at the injection site itself and all the way down her arm. The orthopedic doctor believed the calcium deposits are healing on its own so that is why she did not have to get the shots today. The patient really thought the pain was from the vaccine, or at least some of it is. She stated it was painful enough for her to go the hospital because she did not ever go to doctors or hospitals since she does not have insurance. She did not go unless she has severe pain, she tried to avoid it. The patient confirmed she was not hospitalized, she just went to the emergency room and was only seen there. She could not move her arm or anything. When her husband saw her having to pick her arm up and move it, he actually thought she had a stroke and did not know it. She confirms she told the hospital she believed it was from the vaccine but the hospital said they could not say that. They did an X-ray and they did not see anything. She clarified her not being able to move her arm and wash her hair started at the end of the May2021, right when she went to the hospital. She believed it was 24May2021 or 28May2021 when she went to the hospital. She was crying. She could not move her arm. She could not wash her hair, get dressed. This pain had improved because she was now able to was her hair and get dressed. She still felt jibby jabby pains in it every now and then, she still felt the pain shoot down her arm at the injection site.

Concomitant medication(s) included infliximab (REMICADE) taken for crohn's disease and somatropin (NUTROPIN) taken for blood growth hormone both the products from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, batch/lot number: EW0176) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 30Apr2021, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, red blotches under his skin and blotches on his legs, vasculitis on his bowel, severe stomach pain and on his legs it looked like vasculitis. It was reported that on 21May2021 the patient received the second dose of vaccine and on an unspecified date in May2021 patient experienced symptoms of henoch-schonlein purpura (HSP), which consists of the inflammation of small blood vessels and one week after the dose of vaccine the symptoms of henoch-schonlein purpura flared up again and it can appear on the skin, intestines, joints and where small blood vessels started to leak. The reporter further stated that his son took the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine and developed Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) and stated as HSP is inflammation in the small blood vessels most commonly in children and it affects the skin, intestines and joints with leaking blood vessels. On his son's legs it looked like a vasculitis. His son had these red blotches under his skin. It didn't hurt. He also got vasculitis on his bowel. He had a colonoscopy to diagnosis the vasculitis on his bowel. His son was being treated with steroids. HSP was a chronic condition, and his son has been dealing with it from the last month. The doctor advised him to call Pfizer to report this information and to find out if there is data or any other complaints or notification for HSP from the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. He stated that patient does have other medical conditions as he had Crohn's disease and receives a Remicade infusion every 6 weeks, and he also takes Nutropin for growth hormones. When probing indication for receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he reports convenience because he would have to wear a mask here or there or answer if he's vaccinated or not vaccinated. He didn't decide to receive the Covid 19 vaccine in concerns of his health. He reported that patient never had a positive Covid 19 virus test, the PCR test or the Rapid test. The reporter thought that patient's symptoms began on or around 07May2021 after receiving the first Covid 19 vaccine and the symptoms subsided, and the doctor gave the ok to receive the second covid-19 vaccine. His symptoms did improve prior to the second Covid 19 vaccine. About one week after the second Covid 19 vaccine the symptoms flared up again. Now it's 23Jun2021 and he still has symptoms. He estimates his son was seen at the doctor on 04Jun2021 with a colonoscopy on 09Jun2021. The reporter also mentioned that If Pfizer reaches out to him he does have photographs of his son's legs he can share. He really does believe the HSP came from the Covid 19 vaccine, but that could be one in a million. He stated that he was not calling to discuss symptoms. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test which result showed no abnormalities and urine analysis which result did showed blood which also indicates HSP, and on 09Jun2021 colonoscopy which result was unspecified.

A 50-year-old male patient (Weight: 127.01 kg, Height: 178 cm) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, DOSE 1 SINGLE on 04Apr2021 Afternoon (Lot Number: EP7533) and DOSE 2 SINGLE on 25Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0167) for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination Facility Type: Pharmacy Clinic. Medical history included Hepatic Porphyria from Apr2012 and ongoing (Caller states he knew he had it 10 years ago, but he was diagnosed in April. Caller states so 2012, but it took that long to have another attack that was serious enough to run the test) and ongoing Ulcerative colitis started 25 years ago. There were no concomitant medications. None Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) or AE(s) following prior vaccinations: None. Caller states he is reluctant to report an drug reaction unless he is 100% sure, well unless he is more than 50% sure, but he is confused, and they have ruled everything else out and he needs help. Caller states he has been hospitalized the past 27/55 days in the hospital due to the severity. Caller states he has Hepatic Porphyria. Caller states since receiving the Covid Vaccine, he has been having an exacerbation. Caller states it is an extremely rare genetic condition, where he can not make heme, he is missing an enzyme to make it and get past the 6th step. Caller states all the heme is produced only by one chromosome. Caller states he is guessing that the Pfizer vaccine, being MRNA, is it self amplifying? Caller states he has Hepatic Porphyria, but he has been able to manage it successfully since he discovered he had it the past decade or so, but since he took the vaccine, he has been getting a non stop attack, an exacerbation. Causation: caller states they have ruled everything else out, and the way it works would make since. Hospitalization #1: 18Apr2021-23Apr2021. States he got out that Sunday and had the second dose pm 25Apr2021 and then he was hospitalized again the following week. Hospitalization #2: 05May2021-08May2021. States he got out that week and was hospitalized again. Hospitalization #3: 26May2021-09Jun2021 for a 2 week sent. Hospitalization #4: 11Jun2021-12Jun2021 for 2 Days. Caller states he is dealing with an acute attack right now, and he has not been under control. Caller states he hopes it was the vaccine causing it and it runs itself out. Caller asks, how long does it take for the action to run out? Caller stats he usually only gets an attack for one day, once a year or every other year. Symptoms of these attacks include ""intense abdominal pain and neuro symptoms"" and these symptoms have been ""unrelenting, non-stop"" since being vaccinated. He would like to know how long after vaccination the Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine remains in the body? Also, is there an increased demand for the production of heme anywhere in the pharmacological process for an mRNA vaccine? He stated that if there is an increased demand for heme, this would explain his symptoms. He wants to know how long he should expect the process to last or resolve? The reporter considered the event as serious due to Caused/prolonged hospitalization and Disabling/Incapacitating. Treatment: Pan hematin. The event Exacerbation of Hepatic Porphyria required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office, states he is also seeing a hematologist. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

Main outcomes and measures: Clinical diagnosis of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in the absence of other identified causes. Median (range) age, 25 (20-51) years presented with acute onset of marked chest pain within 4 days after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. All were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second dose of an appropriately spaced 2-dose series.

Intense body aches, chills, headache, fever, sweating, and general feeling of being very unwell. Along with the expected symptoms, I had shaking that was not just from having chills, rapid resting heart rate that was running well above 100. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s and sometimes even 50s.  I also had a feeling of ""deep, intense cold.""  The symptoms gradually eased after the first 24 hours but persisted enough that I was in bed for three days.  After the three days, I struggled with extreme fatigue and felt like I was always freezing cold. I was also having strange changes in my heart rate.My heart would race and then slow down again. After about three weeks, I began to have palpitations which continued to get worse over the following months, especially with any exertion. The fatigue and cold feeling lasted for a few months, and my hands were always ice cold. I am still having the palpitations/arrhythmias. Around April, I felt like I was getting out of shape because of the fatigue and inability to do what I normally did. I decided to start increasing my activity, walking exercising, etc. in order to combat the fatigue and ""get back in shape."" This caused an increase in my palpitations, chest discomfort and shortness of breath which caused me to go home from work a few times and to seek medical attention. I was unable to get right in to see a doctor so I purchases a device for my tablet so that I could try and capture what was occurring and show the doctor. I eventually saw my GP and was referred to a Cardiologist. I was having PVCs. and at this point I had on average eight per minute with episode of many more at times. This has continued and fluctuates in intensity. I think maybe it is slightly improving but sometimes I still have episodes of increased arrhythmias so this is not resolved and is still continuing and limiting my normal activities.

By the end of the day, after dinner, I started feeling really not great. I felt sick to my stomach, I wasn't getting sick/vomiting but then the next day I tried to go out to see my friends at brunch and just talked - I did not eat because it hurts to eat anything. I went to the store and got yogurt because it is all I could stomach. The following day I finally went to the ER because I was just really in pain, I said to my mom can you just cut out my stomach it hurts so bad. The pain was on my left side though, I'm not even sure if that's stomach pain. The DRS at the ER they did exams and they gave me medications for my pain  but they weren't really sure what to diagnose it as. I got a stool softener, a nausea tablet and pain medicine. Most of that week I was still eating just yogurt. Also, mind you, I had started my period around this time and that made it confusing as well. I drove out to Iowa and saw my GI DR on May 11th 2021 in CA and he said well if it is all gone, that's great. So when my period came back, I began having the pains again.

She was placed on 40 milligrams of prednisone as well as 1000 milligram tablets of valacyclovir.  Since initiating those medications, she is noted slight progression in the paralysis of the muscles of the face on the left side.  The eye is now not able to be closed without assistance.  She is noticing some dryness and irritation of the left eye.  She has not had any left upper or lower extremity numbness or weakness.  With her noticing some slight worsening of symptoms here in the past 24 hours, I will up her corticosteroid dose to 60 milligrams for 3 days and then taper her on down with 40 milligrams for 3 days, 20 milligrams for 3 days followed by 10 milligrams for 5 days.  She will complete the valacyclovir as prescribed.  I discussed the importance of eye care to prevent corneal injury while she is unable to close her eyelids.

INDICATION: Elevated d-dimer. Shortness of breath.   COMPARISON: Portable AP chest x-ray 7/12/2021 and CTA chest 11/23/2015   CTA CHEST FINDINGS:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Partially consolidative or compressive atelectasis  posteriorly in the lower lobes and mild atelectasis in the inferior lingula. Mild atelectasis  and/or subpleural scarring posteriorly in the upper lungs. A 0.5 cm noncalcified subpleural  nodular opacity in the lateral right upper lobe on axial series 2 images 57-61 previously  measured 0.4 cm on exam of 11/23/2015, favoring a benign etiology. A smaller 0.2 cm  noncalcified subpleural nodular opacity slightly further anteriorly in the lateral right upper  lobe and a minimally spiculated 0.3 cm nodular opacity further anterior to this also in the  lateral right upper lobe on axial series 2 images 57 and 58 are unchanged to very minimally  enlarged by 1 mm compared to the prior exam. Additional tiny micronodules are seen in the  posterior subpleural right upper lobe on axial series 2 images 72-73. Mild chronic pleural  parenchymal scarring in bilateral lung apices. Remaining lungs are clear. No pneumothorax.   No acute vascular injury or contrast extravasation. No gross pulmonary emboli. Main pulmonary  artery measures approximately 2.7 cm. Aorta is age-appropriate without aneurysm, with  calcifications in the aortic arch and descending aorta and in the coronary arteries. Heart size   is normal with no pericardial effusion. Partially included thyroid gland appears unremarkable.   Slightly enlarged lymph node in the left aorticopulmonary window on axial series 2 image 84  measuring approximately 1.3 cm. Slightly enlarged precarinal lymph nodes are also seen, new  from the prior exam. No hilar adenopathy is identified. No acute infiltrate, consolidation,  pleural effusion, or  pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality.   CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS FINDINGS:  No acute vascular injury or extravasation. Aorta is age-appropriate without aneurysm or  dissection, with scattered atherosclerotic calcifications. Decreased density of the liver  relative to the spleen is likely related to phase of contrast, with superimposed hepatic  steatosis is not entirely excluded. Liver, spleen, gallbladder, and bilateral adrenals are  otherwise unremarkable. Small cystic lesions in bilateral kidneys. Bladder and prostate are  normal. No significant bowel wall thickening or obstruction. What is thought to be the appendix   appears unremarkable without evidence of appendicitis. Tiny miniscule fat-containing ventral  periumbilical hernia. Atherosclerotic calcifications in the abdominal aorta and its distal  branches without aneurysm.   Slight degenerative anterior listhesis L4 on L5 and L3 on L4. Concentric annular bulge at all  levels from L2 to L5 with borderline or mild central canal narrowing at L2-3, moderate central  canal narrowing at L3-4 and moderate to severe central canal narrowing with at least  mild-to-moderate right foraminal narrowing at L4-5. No acute osseous abnormalities.   IMPRESSION:  1. Very minimal if any enlargement of up to 0.5 cm noncalcified pulmonary nodules laterally in  the subpleural right upper lobe since 11/23/2015, likely postinfectious/postinflammatory. If  patient is low risk for malignancy, no routine follow-up imaging is recommended; if patient is  high risk for malignancy, a non-contrast Chest CT at 12 months is optional. If performed and  the nodule is stable at 12 months, no further follow-up is recommended. Reference: Radiology.  2017; 284(1):228-43.  2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis and mild atelectasis in the  inferior lingula.  3. Mild adenopathy in the chest, new since 11/23/2015, likely benign reactive, but recommend  follow-up CT chest in 6 months.  4. No acute abnormality in the abdomen or pelvis.  5. Slightly decreased density of the liver may be related to phase of contrast or less likely  superimposed hepatic steatosis.  6. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with canal and foraminal narrowing as noted above,  greatest at the L4-5 level.  7.

Patient was given a bottle of water and paramedics were called. Paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, checked all vitals and talked to the patient.

That continued for 2 weeks, alternating legs. It ended up becoming prominent in my left leg, so much so that I had an ultrasound on my left leg on 4/23/21. On 4/24/21 I got a sharp headache, the whole right side of my face went numb. On 4/26/21 I called my doctor to tell them what happened and they sent me to the ER.  I was in the ER for 16 hours. In the ER I had bloodwork, MRI and an ultrasound on left leg. I was discharged from the ER.  On 4/30/21 I started getting chest pain/burning sensation. I went to urgent care on 5/3/21 for it. I was given lidocaine to numb my esophagus to rule out heart related chest pain. They did an EKG of my heart as well.   I was sent home with pantoprazole. They diagnosed that it was heart burn related to the vaccine.  I went back to the urgent care 5/7/21 because the chest pain was worse. They did a chest xray, and told me to continue, pantoprazole, tylenol and mylanta and stated they did not see anything wrong with my heart.  After this I went to family doctor for a follow up closer to the end of May. The chest pain was still there and soft to the touch, along with pain (squeezing feeling) in my left arm.  Also, my armpits have been swollen. The doctors think I have Costochondritis. They tell me to take 2 tylenol every 4 hours. It does get better for about 2 weeks then 6/10/21 it comes back with the same symptoms. On 6/14/21 I go back to the doctor and was given a steroid for one week, the steroid alleviates the inflammation. When the steroid is done, the symptoms come back.

Like feeling overall awful and that was the start as soon as I got it within the next 48 hours. The issue I've had since then that sent me to the UC was that I felt like I had a left ear infection. My left ear hurt which was on the same side that I had my shot on. Throbbing and painful and clogged left ear. I felt like I had an ear infection. A few days after that I found right behind my ear, I had a big swelling lymph node and that was before 07/01 and it is still there. I also have a large lymph node under my left armpit.  They've swollen and they're painful and that's ultimately why I went in because I was feeling sick with a lot of fatigue and not feeling good. Because of the ear and lymph nodes behind the ear I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong. When I went to the UC I let them know that I didn't know if it was because of the vaccine. They tested and said I had some kind of infection and they put me on Augmentin it was a 10-day dose twice a day and that's what I began to become allergic to since I was prescribed that. I've had every side effect from Augmentin that you can have. I've had extreme diarrhea, bloating, stomach cramps, joint pains, nausea, lack of appetite and lack of sleep.

On June 28th we took our son  to the doctors for a normal 6 month visit and showed them some of the bruises he had on his arms caused by our daughter grabbing his arms.  They asked normal questions about any bleeding he may have had from circumcision or past shots and we told them none. They said the bruising is okay but to be careful with how our daughter plays with him.   He got his 6 month shots and we went home.  My wife noticed that he was bleeding through the bandaids and his shorts so we went back to the doctors office. They were now concerned and sent us to Hospital. Hospital did extensive blood work and ruled out things like Leukemia and things like lupus for now since his red and white blood cell count was normal. However his Platelet Count is extremely low.   They think he was experiencing ITP or Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura. His platelet count was 5 and should be between 159-350  His body thinks he has a virus and is attacking his platelets. They treated him with immunoglobulins.    Update on son. A normal platelet count should be between 159-350 was 5.    The infusion of immunoglobulins he got last night worked. He got his results back and they were good news.  He increase to 132 and then 218.   The hope is that he will maintain or increase the platelet count from here on out.  He?s had a few blood tests last week and his count is very high and hopefully will level out.   My concern is this:  My wife had her 2nd Pfizer shot on June 9th. We started noticing the bruising on or around the 12th or 13th.   I?ve asked at least a dozen doctors and nurses if the virus that my son?s immune system was fighting could have been caused by my wife?s 2nd Pfizer vaccine since she breast feeds. No one can give me an answer nor will they do any testing. Not to mention my son is a COVID baby. My wife and I both had COVID while she was pregnant with him.   If anything you would think someone would care enough to at least test him for COVID or the antibodies. But no. Everyone just blows me off.   Maybe what happened to him and his case could save another little babies life. If it wasn?t for the bruising on his arms caused by my daughter who knows what could have happened.

I took the pain killer and pain reduced but when I stopped the medication, pain reappeared.   I also found a pattern in the pain. Neck stiffness and pain starts at around 2:00 pm and it increases to 8/9 at around 3:00 to 3:30. The pain at peak is extreme pulsive burning pain and automatically reduces at around 4:30 pm to level 2/3. This happens every day. I always have pain of 2/3 during the throughout the day.  Revisited the Same walk-in clinic and other Dr. said, It might be possibly linked to the Vaccine and they have few more similar cases reported. She prescribed me the Muscle relaxer and steroid and suggested me to contact my PCP for few blood work. I didn't take any of them before contacting my PCP.  PCP ordered some blood work and CTScan. Suggested me to take muscle relaxer and not to take Steroid as It will reduce the vaccine effect.  The Blood and CTScan report came normal. She also referred me to Neurologist.  Neurologist also looked at report and said, everything looks normal.  I took muscle relaxer. Neck stiffness and  head pain is reduced but I still have pain. It repeats at the same time interval and in same manner",,,,,,,,,N,05/30/2021,06/03/2021,4,Please contact : doctor seen,PHM,,NONE,NONE,NONE,,,2,07/13/2021,,Y,,NONE

Thus, I hoped that getting vaccines is going to end the pandemic. I read that the vaccine is unapproved in one place and I think partially approved or approved in another place, experimental, and not FDA approved.

I was unable to lift either arm and had extreme difficulty and pain getting out of bed. Then the balls of my feet also began to give me excruciating pain that I had never felt before. After a couple weeks of trying to figure the source of the pain with doctor visits and referrals I started noticing swelling in the joints of both my hands and feet along with extreme fatigue. After being referred to a rheumatologist and a series of lab exams, it was concluded that I had Sjogren's disease, a chronic autoimmune disorder.

The patient reported that she had the first dose of the vaccine on 12Mar2021. It started about 3 o'clock in the morning (13Mar2021). She was experiencing something she had never experienced before. Later that night and more towards the morning she had joint pain. She noticed this first in her ankles and feet, she only noticed that because she had to go to let her dog out. Then the next day, she had pain in her muscle she had chills to the bone, and she just started with body and muscle aches and that was all last week and she slept the entire week. She had the chills really bad. The site was very red and very sore and swollen. She was like that Saturday, joint pain and chills and then she called a friend of her who got first shot but she got Moderna and she said she had symptoms similar to that (hence submitted as split case), said that was not big deal, that means it working so she was like okay. Then on Sunday she still was not feeling right. She got up and took Xanax. She took her normal medication. She took Xanax for anxiety (Intent: Treatment) and took 5 mg percocet (Oxycodone) for joint pain in order to function, get up and get around and do stuff with her husband who was only home on the weekend. So anyhow she did that on Sunday. She ended up coming to bed early and she fell asleep and the entire week last week she did not do anything she just stayed in bed and she just felt very lethargic. The patient actually fell asleep trying to talk to her husband on the phone, she means on video chat because we video chat every night while we he was awake. So, she thought she was just tired, so she stopped video chat with him and just started talking to him every night and this was last week, and I was really tired. She was in her bed. She had one of the beds where pop comes up and legs come up because she had underlying condition. A big deal underlying condition and all last week she stayed in bed all week and she just slept and when she gets up it actually hurt to walk all her ankles on her feet now. It feels like just touching of her skin, this was been going on since yesterday maybe Friday, just touching of my skin it hurts, it was irritating, wearing cloths irritated, the feet irritate it, her thigh, joint, hip, knees, shoulder, the back of her arm, elbows, forearm, and just tried to massage them and just tried to get through it yesterday. The patient took yet again an anxiety medication within addition to my other medication. She took anxiety medication and an Oxycodone. So that she can go to viewing her husband's friend passed and people were like what's wrong with you, you look like you could fall asleep. They did not stay long, came back home and climbed back in bed and that was where she was all day yesterday. She had not taken anything thus far and literally the sheets she got up last night and as she tried to slide out of bed, it literally hurts rubbing the sheet back of my leg and then getting up out of her bed going in into the bathroom because she had other issues, bladder issues. So, this morning she still had some issues and her husband said could it be the result of the covid, the vaccine you got, and she said you know what I never even thought of that, so she started reading some paperwork and it was like joint pain. She was like well she got more than joint pain or muscle pain that she got joint muscle and chills. She was still feeling the same way. Her back hurts just lying on the bed and hurts. When she gets up to move it feels like her ribs are killing her, her arms hurt the front of her breasts. This was something new and prolonged. Walking to the kitchen her feet, ankles, calves and back hurt and her nightgown is hurting her skin. Her bones feel hurt, and her calves hurt. The injection site was just sore.

It was reported that she tests her own INR and it went down to 2.2, it was up to 2.8 and for some reason it dropped down to 2.2 in middle of the week and I am due to test tomorrow and for some reason the doctor called but that his test was done before she got the shot. The patient stated that she supposed to figure out the drug interaction, possible drug interaction maybe as she takes other drugs.

Having to use a calculator to do the math on how much cement is needed and he used to be able to do all of this in his head.  He's forgetting to call customers back.  His boss stopped in yesterday for the first time since April and they were going over the financial loans he said before the 2nd shot he could pull all the numbers right out of his head but yesterday had to look them up and and still gave his boss the wrong numbers.  He said the weakness is awful too, 5 years ago he said he passed the step test for the fire department and now he can't walk up 5 steps due to being too weak.  He said he won't drive a cement truck right now and it's been 2 months since the 2nd shot and it's their busy time.

He said he is allergic to the flu shot but got this shot trying to do the right thing but he said there is talk of a 3rd shot and he said he could never get that because he believes it will kill him.

Long story short -- the next day I drove her to another Hospital. We were there from 2-8 p.m. The Dr. removed a bolus at 7:15 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. and he said ""everything looks good"". HOWEVER -- my mom continued having ""esophagus"" issues from that time on. And ALSO, on April 4, she told me, ""I don't feel good"" and she proceeded to fall asleep on her couch and did NOT WAKE UP for about 6 weeks except to use the bathroom, take her morning and evening pills and eat a tiny bit of soft foods.

1470160,07/14/2021,PA,46.0,46,,F,,"I received the first dosage of the Moderna vaccine on May 4th of this year.  On May 6th, I had what I term a ?neurological event?.  For several hours, roughly 3, I was so dizzy and nauseous that I couldn?t walk the 20 feet (from living room couch to kitchen) to let my cat in from our deck.  My body temp dropped significantly, I had extreme sensitivity to light and sound, my leg muscles were twitching, my skin was crawling, hands were shaking, and I felt extremely agitated, had difficulty sleeping.  The next day, I had hot flashes, terrible headache, warped vision, dizziness, I was pacing incessantly, and my level of disorientation and confusing was unsettling.  I couldn?t find the right words during conversation, I couldn?t recall small details from one moment to the next, familiar names sounded unfamiliar, I was having trouble following and remembering conversation details, difficulty organizing thoughts, and I was misspelling words that I normally have no trouble with it all, I am an impeccable speller, typically!  My most severe neurological symptoms continued on May 7th and May 8th.  Hot flashes, dry and irritated eyes (feeling like I wanted to claw them out), blurred vision, confusion, headache, and itching skin all continued.  On May 8th, after having a civil conversation with my husband (we are considering moving, I want to move out of the area more than he does, so I was a little frustrated by our conversation) I excused myself to my bedroom, holding my head from this persisting headache, but then suddenly, inexplicably I began screaming and cursing at the top of my lungs and I started to throw my little bottles of acrylic paints down the hallway, until one took an unfortunate left turn and hit the wall, red paint covered the wall and book shelves and carpet, and my emotions quickly turned to sadness and remorse, and I was crying uncontrollably trying to clean it up.  I couldn?t make sense of my extreme behavior, it just wasn?t like me, and the punishment (me throwing paints) didn?t suit the crime (a mildly frustrating conversation).    On May 14th, I had a telehealth visit with my Internist Dr.  (from).  He listened to all of my symptoms and concerns, and I communicated to him that I fear I may have had a seizure or a stroke post vaccine.  The only advice/insight he could offer is that my prescription (my only prescription medication) to treat my anxiety, Viibryd 20 mg once daily, might be the problem.  He asked me to try weaning off of Viibryd, so I followed his advice.  I immediately decreased from 20 mg to 10 mg from May 14th to May 20th.  So May 21st was my first day of no Viibryd, and has continued to be the case since then.  Interestingly, on May 20th, I began to feel intense nerve pain in a spot on my back, to the left of my spine.  I kept asking my husband ?Please tell me what is on my back, is there a bug bite there?? And he promised me over the next few days that there was absolutely nothing there.  On May 23rd, a ?bug bite? and/or rash appeared.  It was the most painful and itchy skin condition I have ever experienced.  The intensity of itching and pain and me clawing at my back, scratching it open, and begging my husband nightly to please ?Get it out of my back, there is something in my back!? continued for a good 2 weeks (please see attached photo) and the area continues to bother me on and off to this day (which I treat with Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP, 0.1%, prescribed to me by Dr. , at  urgent care clinic on 6/18.  This is only relief I have received thus far for any of my symptoms). The new set of inflammatory symptoms that accompanied the emergence of this rash/ bug bite are:  Extreme dry and itchy eyes, symptoms escalate in the early evening and are the worst at night (I have a ?few good hours? during the day), fatigue, hot flashes, body feels on fire from the inside, no amount of ice packs and cold showers resolves these symptoms, elevated temperature (my baseline is 97.2 and my temp consistently is 98.1 with this inflammation), marked inflammation and swelling in my hands and legs and body (my rings get stuck on my hands at night, my clothes feel too tight), headaches, my skin hurts/aches, this feels like Mono times 1,000 (I did have Mono 15 years ago), my throat ?glands? are sore and swollen, I have a cyst above my right hip (that I have addressed with my Internist pre-vaccine and he dismissed as nothing) that is so painful and inflamed that I can?t sleep on my right side (which is my preferred side to sleep on), and I have muscle weakness/stiffness in my hands (trouble gripping everyday objects and making a fist).  If I take 2 Alleve (one does nothing) I will get some occasional relief, but even then, Alleve doesn?t always work.  I saw my Internist () on June 8th with this new set of symptoms.  He made it clear from the beginning of my visit that he knew of my 1st visit with Dr. , they had discussed my symptoms.  I tried sharing my notes and new inflammatory symptoms (and did mention and touch upon the unanswered 1st set of neurological symptoms) and was so dismissive of everything I said.  It was very upsetting.  He diagnosed me with stress induced migraines.  I tried explaining to him that I started experiencing migraines in 2nd grade (I am 46 now) and I?ve had both standard and ocular migraines, know what they are like and how to treat them, and they have become much less frequent for me over the years.  I told Tim that these experiences are not migraines.  He insisted they are, and prescribed me Imitrex (without checking my medication allergies in my chart, I am highly allergic to Sulfa/Bactrim.  The pharmacist later alerted me to this).  I stressed my concerns about neurological disorders that run in my family, my Dad is currently perishing from end stages of Alzheimer?s, seizures have begun for him, and we lost his sister in February to Alzheimer?s as well).  I had to beg Tim for appropriate testing, so he conceded to a CT scan for me (of which the results were normal, outside of the previous finding of atherosclerosis of right vertebral artery) and bloodwork (please see attached).  I told  of the rash/bug bite on my back and he refused to look at my photos of it and also refused to look at my back (a bump is still present). I saw  again on 6/17 with the same continuing inflammatory symptoms, and to review my blood work and CT scan.  He said all the tests look great, there is nothing to worry about, it looks like the migraines are resolving.  Again, I told him I am concerned about my continuing symptoms and asked if he thinks I should see a Neurologist and/or a Rheumatologist.  He discouraged me from seeing any specialists, he said the migraines are resolving and the only thing a Rheumatologist is going to tell me is that I might have arthritis in my hands, and there?s nothing more they can do for me.  I informed him of the Imitrex prescription Sulfa allergy oversight, and he seemed surprised, and added Imitrex to my list of medication allergies.  I left the office feeling livid and so discouraged.  I called his office the next day (6/18) to express my frustration and displeasure with how dismissive had been, and I truly feel he is overlooking something serious, perhaps Shingles?  The staff put me on a long hold, and the best they could offer would be for me to see another P.A. the following week (as Dr.  would be on vacation).

Sometimes there was an achy feeling but the burning was more prominent. On that wednesday, I decided to go to Urgent care as the symptoms did not stop. They had me do a chest xray but did not see any cause for concern and so I was sent home and told to keep an eye on it and that if I had any difficulty breathing or terrible pain in my chest, I should go to the ER. That Saturday, May 8, I went to my doctor's office because I was getting worried and the sensation was not going away. I had begun to feel some chest tightness every now and again. It had now been a week. I was seen by a doctor who said that the vaccine can cause lymph node swelling and that was probably what was happening to me. She felt my chest and arm and said that she could feel swelling. I could feel a bit of swelling in my arm but nowhere else. There were no visible lumps or anything like that. But she said not to worry about it and that it will go away. After another week, I went to my actual doctor for a check up (May 15). After explaining to her what was happening and the anxiety it was causing me, she did an EKG. Results of that were normal and she also did not see any cause for concern.

Both worked; Ibuprofen probably works a little better, but I would take Acetaminophen if I had not eaten anything. After a few weeks of these daily headaches, I started taking either pain medication at the first sign of an impending headache.   The quality of the headaches were (and continue to be) a dull ache, usually in the back (occipital) of my head and often on the back-right side. Sometimes the ache would be on the sides (parietal) and less often still frontal. No light sensitivity. My physician has diagnosed me and has probably also submitted a VAERS form.   The headaches were daily for at least 6 weeks and I am now getting a break for a day once in a while (maybe 3-4 times). Usually I take Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen daily, so I don't know if a headache would have developed now, so I don't know how regularly they might be coming now, but I did have one 2 days ago and a slight one yesterday despite medication.",,,2,07/14/2021,,Y,,"Penicillin, statins.

When I was driving home the lightheadedness got so bad that I had to pull over and sat for 15-20 minutes. I called my brother and he told me to get something to eat. I just had some steamed vegetables. I came home, ate and drank a lot of water to try and get the wooziness to pass. I did not have an unusual amount, no more than I would usually drink. Then after the last bottle of water I had, I started getting more queasy and started to feel dizzy. I then vomited all over my self from head to toe. That lasted for two or three hours and then after that I was dry heaving. That happened on Friday, on Saturday I was too afraid to eat anything I only had toast and a smoothie. On Sunday I was just so woozy and lightheaded and exhausted. I didn't feel chills or anything though. My brother brought me soup on Sunday and I did have some broth. I also started drinking a little bit more water. The water didn't taste good though - it tasted like the vaccine so I did not want to have it.

1470578,07/14/2021,OH,66.0,66,,F,,"Instant headache and pain shooting down arm and side while being injected, sick feeling and light headed right as I was leaving the facility.  Within 4 hours I was struggling to do anything.  I was tired and felt and nauseated, light headed and felt like i was hit by a truck.  The bottoms of my feet hurt and I had stabbing pains so bad in my knee joints I could barely walk without assistance.  I felt very ill for about a week after the shot but the headaches continued constantly for over a month but aren't daily anymore even though I still have them, and the fatigue was getting worse and still is a problem to this day. Once I was feeling a bit better my right knee started to give out and my left knee was cracking. Since I got that vaccine on 3/6/21 I have had back to back problems.  Below is a quick list of these things that have occurred by dates: 3/30/21 - Constant headaches since the vaccine and ear pain and throat issues.  4/16/21 - Right knee giving out on me that started shortly after vaccine and gotten worse.  X-ray and physical therapy ordered.  4/22/21 - Shortness of breath, back pain, constant fatigue.  Blood work that showed elevated D-dimer then chest x-ray and ct-scan ordered. 4/26/21 - Ultrasound for nodule found on ct-scan. 5/4/21 - Biopsy done of mediastinal mass. 5/11/21 - Physical done for surgery. 5/24/21 - Surgery to remove mediastinal mass, right side of thyroid, two parathyroids and lymph nodes. 6/1/21 - Follow-up for surgery.  When I asked why this happened, the doctor said we may never know but the biopsy of the right thyroid nodule result showed thyroiditis, Autoimmune/Hashimoto's, and  that my immune system attacked my thyroid.  The doctor said she tested me for that in 9/20 and it was negative. 6/2/21 - Left knee pain.  About 4 days after my surgery on 5/24 i turned towards the door and heard a loud pop in my left knee.  It had been crackling since the vaccine but wasn't giving out like the right one. I couldn't walk on it at all and was using crutches.   6/9/21 - Mri on left knee showed medial and lateral meniscus tears.  Referred to Ortho Dr. 6/28/21 - Test thyroid levels post op.  TSH levels high.  Referral to Endocrinologist. 6/30/21 - Left knee treatment, cortisone shot in knee for now to help with pain and inflammation so I can function and physical therapy.  Since then my 4th toe on my right foot has been numb for almost two weeks.  I am scheduled for numerous future physical therapy appointments and doctors appointments.    Then to make matters worse I just heard 2 days ago that J&J is having more issues and mentioned autoimmune and wondered could that be what caused all of this?   I regret getting that stupid J&J vaccine.  I expected it to he the Pfizer because that is what was there 2 days before I got my shot.  I told the person I didn't want it and she got someone in charge to talk me into it.  I should have walked out of there and I am mad at myself for caving to this woman.  If J&J says we need a booster I will refuse to take it.  I don't know if the vaccine was what triggered all of this but I find it quite odd that all of this started almost immediately after I got that vaccine.  Not only to me but also to my sister who got it at the same time.  She fell within 30 minutes of getting that vaccine and 3 more times that day, and has had and is still having numerous problems that mimic mine, such as issues with her feet and legs.  She struggles to walk and is having issues with her thyroid among other things that she wasn't having a problem with prior to the vaccine. This is just the short version of all I have been through.

I expected pain in my arm again since that is how it felt the first time.  The pain felt as if someone punched me extremely hard, leaving me feeling like I needed a sling to support the injury.  The pain in my left arm felt had a throbbing, pulsing, almost numbing feel all on the outside and although it did feel a little different than the first time, I figured it would get better like after the first vaccine I received on May 11, 2021.   Other symptoms I experienced were: waxing and waning low-grade fevers all day, severe fatigue and brain fog, dizziness,  little appetite, shakiness, rapid breathing and then shallow breathing (in line with my heart pounding or slowing down), and nausea. The symptoms were familiar to me, and it felt like deja vu but a milder version of when I had Covid-19 in August 2020.  As a reference to what I will mention next, when I had Covid-19 last year I developed subacute thyroiditis from the acute respiratory virus, and this was supported by a blood test.  My levels appeared to be normal going into the vaccine, and since I never have had thyroid challenges the past I didn't expect to have fluctuating hormones post Covid or post-vaccine.   As of now, July 14, 2021, I still am experiencing some of the milder symptoms on occasion (brain fog, dizziness, shakiness), and the hormone regulation has been a bit off too.  My left arm has a dull ache/pain and numbness the starts at the vaccine site in my shoulder down the outside of the arm, pulses pain in my left wrist, and stops at the last two fingers on my left hand.  As far as I can tell, I do have full range of motion and can still exercise.  My recovery time is slower and the tingling feeling doesn't subside, and if anything it increases randomly.  I was hoping the dull ache and numb feeling would subside by this point, but it hasn't.

They're so bad I can't get out of bed for the first two days of my period - then I have infrequent occasional pangs of pain on day 3, and I'm okay days 4 and 5. I have never had cramps during my cycle before April 2021.   2. On April 16th, I was driving my car and I noticed that when I had my foot on the the brake, it was shaking uncontrollably in almost every position I put my leg in. The frequency of this leg tremor during driving became more frequent, and I started noticing heightened anxiety, trouble focusing, weight loss of 7 pounds thus far (my weight has not fluctuated more then 3 pounds in the last 4 years so this was a surprise to me), lightened period, increased heat intolerance, heart palpitations that keep me awake at night and tachychardia, muscle weakness, and fatigue. I had a really stressful semester in school so I chalked these symptoms up to anxiety.  Then, in the first week of June, I went to the gynecologist to get the cramps situation checked out. She told me she wanted me to check out my thyroid for the rest of the symptoms. When my blood test came back, my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) result came back as 0.03 (lowest acceptable range is 0.4). My primary care provider ran T3 and T4 tests, which came back as 15 and 5, respectively - which are both quite elevated for their range. So, I went to an endocrinologist at my primary care provider's referral, who ran more tests. This time, they found TSH to be 0.006 (got lower), T3 and T4 were elevated, very slightly lower than they were before. My endocrinologist then ran a test for Thyroglobulin antibody, which came back as 53.3, when the highest reference value was 0.9. Thus, my endocrinologist determined hyperthyroidism, but wanted to figure out the what I had so she sent me for a thyroid uptake scan. In the scan, they found my thyroid to be working at 51%, when the highest value after 24 hours of receiving the radioactive iodine was 33%, and my endocrinologist determined that I had Graves' Disease, an autoimmune hyperthyroid disease.   I am now on Methimazole and Propranolol for Graves' Disease.

On 5/7, I had extreme chest pain where I could not move my arm. I went to the ER where they did a scan of my heart to check for fluid and a D dimer test. Since receiving the shot, I noticed my tonsils would swell up after eating. I had to stop eating and went on an ensure diet. I went to an allergist that said I was severely allergic to rice, a dog, but I was never allergic to anything before. I went back to the cardiologist where the PA said even though there is nothing wrong, maybe there is unseen myocarditis or pericarditis. The medication messed with my stomach. I went to check that everything was fine with my lungs where everything was deemed fine. On 5/27, I did a stress test which was fine. On 6/2, I had experienced shortness of breath again. I was unable to work normally and had to stop working. Doctor did tests for inflammatory diseases Mitochondrial M2 antibodies was in the middle range. This is inconclusive. I went to doctor who ran a lot of tests and found that Sedimentation rate was too high, Comprehensive metabolic rate was normal, CMV Igg: positive. He said perhaps I have long haul COVID. The antibody test showed I was positive for the vaccine antibodies but not the true COVID antibody. He suggested it could be an inflammatory issue. I saw an ENT for my throat who put me on antibiotics. The antibiotics helped but when I got off, I had another flare up. I was put on more antibiotics. On 6/29, I went to another cardiologist who did a contact MRI. He saw a swollen left atrium but said it was overall normal. I also saw a pulmonologist to notify them that the shortness of breath is still sometimes present. I saw a GI who did a test and found that I had erosive gastritis.

It did not improve, so he had me go to my PCD and he sent me to a ENT specialist and prescribed me antibiotics. I do not have the date but I saw the ENT Dr and he looked me over, no blood or anything. He also did a scope inside my nose and did not find anything of significance to report. He prescribed me to see another Optician. I saw her and they did an MRI and a lot more blood work there and I got the results from there. So those results showed there was no tumor or anything like that.

1474672,07/15/2021,VA,33.0,33,,F,,"On the evening of Friday, April 16th, 2021, I experienced increased body temperature, chills, severe nausea. I completed COVID-19 testing on 4/17/21 (both rapid test and PCR test were negative). I continued to experience persistent elevated body temperature (although not true fever), periods of warmth, chills, recurrent headaches (frontal), exhaustion, burping, more pale looking, and periods of lightheadedness (when at work and home, regardless of what I was doing). I scheduled a 'sick' visit with my primary care physician, completing a telehealth visit (per my MD) on 4/27/21 due to the aforementioned symptoms. I received a blood pressure monitor free through my health insurance and began taking my blood pressure at the beginning of May. My blood pressure during the first two weeks of May was averaging 95/62 (with peak blood pressure reading of 107/65) with my blood pressure cuff identifying irregular heartbeats on 5/6/21, 5/11/21, 5/12/21.  Although some symptoms resolved, I continued to experience periods of lightheadedness, chest pain/pressure in the middle of my chest, and soft blood pressure readings.  I saw my rheumatologist on 5/12/21 (who also documented a low blood pressure reading in office and wrote an order for an ECHO). I completed a telehealth visit with my GI, who advised to continue use of pantoprazole and increased PRN use of sucralfate. I continued to experience increasingly more frequent instances of lightheadedness, increasing chest pain/pressure, and my blood pressure continued to decrease. I was 'strongly advised' by my primary care MD's office to seek cardiac workup at an Emergency Room on 5/18/21. I presented to the Emergency Department on 5/18/21 at approximately 1330 and was discharged from the ED at approximately 3:30am on 5/19. I was advised to complete my already scheduled ECHO (scheduled and completed on 5/25/21), to seek the care of a cardiologist, and follow-up with my primary care MD.  I saw a NP  who is part of my primary MD's office on 5/20/21. I saw cardiologist on 5/27/21, who advised me to hydrate with liberal use of salt (due to persistent low blood pressure readings, documented during my in-person office visit). I completed a stress test on 6/18/21.  Due to persistent low blood pressure, my cardiologist started me on midodrine 5mg tablets twice a day and ordered a Ziopatch cardiac monitor to be worn for 5 days. I was advised by my cardiologist to see an endocrinologist as he is unable to identify the cause of my low blood pressure.

In the evening, I went to my grandchild's concert at school at 7:00PM. While at the concert, my neck started throbbing and I started getting a headache. When the concert ended, I started having trouble walking back to the vehicle. I wasn't able to get out of the truck or walk myself to the door, so my son had to help me. When I got home, I took some Excedrin or Tylenol, but after a bit, I ended up throwing up. I was in my bed and I was so dizzy that I couldn't get up, so I threw up on my feet and the floor. The next morning, I woke up and felt like I had the flu. I threw up several times over the weekend. Come Monday, 05/10/2021, I asked my son if he could pick up some Pepto bismol because it helped a bit. On Monday evening, my son bought me a humidifier because we thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. On Wednesday, 05/12, I had to take an Uber to the hospital. While I was at the hospital, I had an MRI, a CT scan and blood work drawn. At first, they thought there was a blood clot in my lungs, but then it was ruled out. They gave me Benadryl and something else (he called it a cocktail). It took away some of the pain, but the headache never went away. They kept me overnight for observation and to do a second MRI in the morning. I was on a heart monitor the whole time. I saw a doctor before I left, and they weren't able to locate any problems. They came up with migraines. I was given a shot of sumatriptan and the same medicine in pill form 100mg to take when I was at home. As of today, 3 months after receiving my vaccine, I am still feeling foggy, and I have had quite a few headaches. I ended up seeing a Neurologist.

Thursday, June 24, 2021, 9am she was at the clinic. The doctor ordered an x-ray and blood work. After results arrived, we were advised to go to the emergency room. There the doctor ordered CT scan. The results showed an abscess and fluid in her left lung and pneumonia. Her lung was drained, was not able to get all of it out. They discussed surgery but needed to send pt. to ER. The discussion for surgery was a daily thing but never happened. They tried multiple procedures, CT scans, etc. On Tuesday, June 29, 2021 there was a meeting called with her doctor to discuss palliative care. The risk of surgery and all the complications following were high risk. Pt. did not understand that she needed to leave the IV and drainage tube in as well as leaving the oxygen on.

1475420,07/15/2021,MI,26.0,26,,F,,"So April 23rd during the day I felt a weird numbness in my tongue on the right side. I thought that maybe I burned it or bit it or something similar.  Then I went to work that night because I worked over nights(it was a very stressful night).  About halfway through the night into the early morning may be about 3:00 a.m. I started to feel we are numbness on the right side of my face I cannot just chalked it up to stress. When I left in the morning if I like it wasn't really moving right, just felt a little off. It was about 7:00 a.m. At this point I still thought I was just overly stressed I told my husband when I got home and just tried to lay down to relax. I had had  a slight ear ache for about 3 days but at this point it became more uncomfortable than it had been and my face felt like It was getting worse and it really started to worry me. So I decided to go to the walk in at Medical group. I saw the nurse practitioner.  At this point my face wasn't doing everything it was supposed to be doing but it wasn't fully numb yet. She said it could be due to an ear infection so she checked my ears but she said that it was weird because it was just slightly red. She wanted to transfer me over to the emergency Room is so that I could get a cat scan done. The doctor at the ER said that she wouldn't do a cat scan at this point she would just treat the ear infection so there was no point in moving me over to the ER. So the nurse practitioner prescribed a couple different medications and suggested that I follow up as soon as possible with my primary. Throughout the rest the day on April 24th ,when I saw the nurse practitioner, my face got progressively worse and wasn't moving very much closer to the end of the night. By the next day my right side of my face was not moving at all and that was April 25th. April 26th As soon as possible in the morning I called my primary care doctor and they got me in immediately to see her. She was unsure it was due to the ear infection and wanted to get more tests done to make sure that something else wasn't causing it and it could get worse. In at this point there was pain slightly so I  had taken some time off from work to get the test done.   The tests were an MRI scan and some blood work.  Then I had a follow up appointment with her right after. With in a couple days after first seeing my primary I had so much pain that I couldn't even get out of bed. It hurt to even slightly touch that side of my face or neck.  They said with it being nerve pain there wasn't much that they could give me or do to get that would help it go away. I ended up having about 2 weeks off from work before I went back not sure if I was fully ready with of the pain that I was having in my face still was not working but I could not afford not to. All the medication and everything that I was on during  the 1st 2 weeks had caused my palpitations to act up so I ended up having to get more tests on top of it to make sure that it was not negatively affecting my heart.  It's been over 2 months closer to almost 3 months and my face is now slightly working not all the way though but it is getting there. so not fully recovered. and having to watch my heart rate and thyroid levels (since i had been having good levels for two years she was worried it would make it act up or  cause a problem with the nodules i have on thyroid. ) hopefully I haven't missed any information. Just hoping there is no perminent damage or side effects and that after some more time it fully goes away.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/01/2021,04/24/2021,113,"Creatinine  blood draw, MRI of brain with and without contrast, X-ray, EKG, Holter monitor, Echocardiogram,  TSH blood draw,  Nothing showed significant findings to what caused it or anything very helpful.

Unfortunately, about 2 weeks after the 1st Pfizer vaccine, I started having tinnitus very severely.

At the time there were maybe 300 members on that site, which has now been renamed to (Privacy) and has 2,800 members!  At that point I knew that that was my issue and decided NOT to get the second shot the next day.  It was so severe that I could not risk getting worse.  I could not concentrate, could barely sleep, was very tense, etc.  After (1) reading that while some people got worse after the second shot, many did not see any change, and (2) since I wanted very badly to be fully vaccinated for ease of travel in the future, and (3) since my tinnitus seemed to improve slightly approximately April 12-16, I went ahead and got the second dose.  Since then it got way worse, but then there were better days, too.  As I write this on July 16 at around 2:30am, it has been way way worse since approximately July 7th or 8th.
