After vomiting got the shakes and felt very cold. Checked blood pressure and it was very high (170/98), but pulse rate was in low 30s. After a few hours blood pressure and pulse rate became closer to normal. Almost decided to go to ER clinic, but decided to wait until my daughter came home from work because I was way too dizzy to drive. After I calmed down I decided it wasn't an emergency. Severe vertigo continued through evening of day 4. On day 4 I called primary care doctor to see if there was anything I could do for the vertigo. She prescribed meclizine, but hearing that it is an antihistamine, I declined it (antihistamines make my heart race and make me very anxious). Severe vertigo/nausea continued through day 5 and day 6. (Severe vertigo/nausea being that I could not move around at all other than to sit still staring forward without the room spinning.) All this period I also had a headache, a feeling of pressure through my whole head/sinus area, and my vision was blurred. I also felt as though I could not focus my eyes or concentration. I tried using some over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray for 2 days to relieve congestion in head, but they made me feel very anxious, so I stopped. I also tried taking some Aleve a couple of times. It helped a little, but made me feel woozy, so stopped. Day 6 the vertigo/nausea improved to moderate, but I could still not walk straight. I felt unsafe to drive. Day 7 continued to improve, but still moderate vertigo/nausea. Day 8 I noticed a lot of improvement in vertigo/nausea. Kept improving day 9. By evening on day 10 I was noticing a rawness and lump in the back of my throat. Called primary care office day 11 to see someone. Drove car, but felt marginally safe driving. Was diagnosed with a sinus infection and prescribed a 10 day course of Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (875-125 mg for 2 pills a day for 10 days). Felt improvement in throat and sinus over next few days. Day 15 I felt greatly improved with head ?fog? and vertigo. Had an appointment with an ENT clinic on day 15 to see what was causing vertigo. All tests were good for hearing, and visual examination of ears. Was checked for BPV but that was ruled out. Said vertigo was probably caused by viral infection or inflammation of vestibular nerve or canals. Recommended waiting for improvement and coming back if it persisted. Began doing more normal activities even though I still had mild vertigo. Day 16 felt still better in morning, then in afternoon bent over quickly to catch something and got a terrible wave of spinning again. Moderate/severe vertigo continued that evening. Improved to moderate on day 17 and 18. All along, when vertigo was worse, so was the ?fog? (blurry vision, inability to focus mentally). At day 19 I feel like I did on day 15, but I have noticed the pressure/lump around my ear and on left side of head is improved. Brain ?fog? is improved too, very mild and the vertigo is mild. I finish my antibiotic tomorrow.At present vertigo is not gone. Its mild today, but this is only one of maybe 2 1/2 days in which its been this mild (out of almost three weeks since I was vaccinated). I have been drinking a lot of water every day, and ginger tea when I get nauseous. I had my 2nd dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine scheduled for Mar 15. I?ve cancelled it and intend to wait to see how long it takes for vertigo to finally resolve before considering a 2nd dose.",,,,,,,,,N,02/21/2021,02/22/2021,1,"ENT exam of ears and hearing March 15, 2021 No evident issues.",PVT,,"Metformin 750 mg, Synthroid 75 mcg, Losartan 50 mg Vitamin C, D w/calcium, baby aspirin, multivitamin",None,"Arthritis, low thyroid (without meds), hypertension (without meds), prediabetic",,,2,03/13/2021,,Y,,Tetracycline and Demerol make me nauseous

I got up to check my face in the mirror to be sure that I was not having a reaction. But I did have a reaction with a rash on my chest and face 9 hours after the injection. My arm really hurt for three days but is fine now.  When I saw my red face and chest, I took a Zyrtex D and a Benadryl.  It did not seem to help the redness to go away.

I felt much better after the epipen in terms of my thinking and throat.

With the pandemic and 48 new cases, I decided to stay home and I went to bed; the rash on my face was gone in the morning.

I went down the basement stairs and walked up and I felt my heart was racing and pounding (this is something I do multiple times a day with ease). I have an oxometer and my heart was very high. I tried resting (by sitting) and my heart rate didn?t drop below the high 80s. I walked through a room and up a flight of stairs and down (in my home) and my heart rate peaked at 154 (wearing oxometer). My BP was also high for me 148/94. I called my primary care physicians office, spoke with a nurse that recommended I go to the emergency room.   Tests were normal and I  was released. The burning sensation remains. Since returning home heart rate gets high very easily and I can feel it pounding when I walk, though fortunately it hasn?t gone over the mid 130s. My blood pressure when checked at home was still high for me but quite a bit lower than when I first checked it at home. To be honest, I?m far from a pro at taking my BP so I?m not sure of the accuracy of either measurement.",,,,,,,,,N,03/11/2021,03/11/2021,0,EKG (3-13-2021) told was normal and chest X-rays (3-13-2021) also told were normal.

I all cases it was apparent that my  distant vision had substantially changed. It was true for both eyes. I saw an ophthalmologist who said their was no organic  problems but suggested cataracts. I asked if cataract s could change so dramatically and also asked how my cataracts compared to the last visit. Basically nada.

Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).",,,Y,,,,,,U,03/08/2021,03/08/2021,0,"None.

Initially, I wrote off the symptoms as being not connected to the vaccine. Within the following 2 weeks, I began having muscle tremors throughout my entire body, including facial. The tremors started out mild then progressed to being much worse (e.g. unable to hold a smile or walk up stairs without significant muscle tremors). Fatigue by this time had become debilitating to the point where I was only able to move around for a few hours at a time.   In December 2019, I went to see my primary care doctor. She had multiple labs performed to rule out other items (such as electrolyte imbalance and some additional more severe possibilities such as parkinsons) as an effect of Hep A vaccine in this way is rare. After ruling out multiple possibilities and seeing no connection with the symptoms, she referred me to Dr. with Neurology.   Dr. was able to see me in February 2020. By this time, the fatigue was so crippling, I was only able to get out of bed 2-3 hours a day with the rest being bedridden. Muscle tremors and extreme muscle weakness had also increased along with mental related problems such as memory issues, focus and the like.  Over the following 12 months, Dr. performed numerous in office tests as well as labs ranging from electrical tests to lab draws to MRI's. After ruling out several issues unrelated to a bad vaccine, such as Myastenia Gravis and other possible related diseases, and after performing a battery of tests, he has diagnosed me with the following:  1. Chronic fatigue - R53.82 (Primary) 2. Mild cognitive impairment with memory loss - G31.84 3. Encephalitis - G04.90  I reported the findings to nurse with epidemiology. Her information is below.

My eyes remained closed until I was wheeled into the emergency area and they asked me my name.  I was taken to a private room, where they hooked up a blood pressure cuff, an oxygenator on my finger, and took several viles of blood. I was then taken to the cat scan room for a brain scan, and several hours later, was given a chest xray.  I remained in the room for approx 6 hours, where I was becoming more and more aware of where I was. I had not eaten/drank anything, except a cup of water. I had not used the lavatory.  The PA came to me hours later stating all my tests came back negative, and they could not determine what happened, xrays and blood tests were good, and cat scan was good.  He said that while they couldn't determine what happened, they would recommend a stay, so they can do more extensive testing.  I contacted my husband via cell, told him what they said, and after another 1 1/2 hours, I made the decision to release myself as I was feeling more like myself again, albeit tired.

It stopped responding to Advil and the pressure continued to increase on both sides of my head with sharp, shooting pains throughout that would come and go with the constant pressure.

They called in generic version of Imitrex that evening; but since this migraine was so different than my normal pattern, I went to the ER on Saturday. They did a CT scan to make sure there were no  brain bleeds and gave me IV magnesium and steroids. I declined the torodol and Benadryl. The headache was still there, but bearable finally when I left. It got worse again that evening and I ended up taking the imitrex at 3am and falling asleep, only to wake up at 7am with a skull splitting feeling.

I went to sit for the mandatory 15 minute ""observation"" period, sitting with a couple of my coworkers who were being vaccinated at this time as well. After approximately two minutes, I started feeling a little light-headed and had slight difficulty breathing. I mentioned it to my coworkers and they suggested I take off my mask (masks were required for everyone). I did so and took a couple deep breaths which made me feel better. I put my mask back on and continued chatting with my coworkers. About 5 minutes later I felt the same, slight difficulty breathing again, but thought it was probably due to my mask, so I repeated - mask off, deep breaths - and felt better. As a precaution, I stayed in the observation area for 30 minutes with one my coworkers, but did not experience any other problems. Feeling a little shaky but otherwise okay, I left at that point and walked to my car. Once in the car, I took off my mask and took more deep breaths. Feeling okay, I started my drive home (approx 7 minutes). About halfway on the drive I felt a slight difficulty in breathing again, so I rolled down the window, took deep breaths. Arriving home, I told my husband I felt ""a little weird"". My throat felt slightly swollen, the back of my neck felt stiff, my lips felt a bit numb, my face felt tingly and my jaw felt tight. It was about 2:45 at this point. I felt the outside of my throat with my fingers and realized my tonsils were quite swollen. My husband felt them, too, and agreed. However, nothing was visibly swollen in my face or neck, only felt inwardly. I still felt a bit shaky and had an occasional metallic taste in my mouth. I drank some water and laid down, with my feet slightly elevated. My husband stayed with me, both of us monitoring my symptoms in case anything got worse and medical attention was needed, but nothing got worse. My symptoms stayed at this level for the next few hours. I sat up occasionally and continued to drink water. I would get occasional waves of slight difficulty in breathing, but would take deep breaths and that would help. My airway never felt constricted, I just felt like I need a bit more oxygen. By early evening, I was feeling a little tired, but was able to eat dinner without problem and by about 8pm I was feeling a bit better. The swelling in my tonsils had subsided a little at this point and the waves of difficulty in breathing were getting much less often and milder. I slept through the night without problem. In the morning, however, I did not feel very well. I felt quite fatigued and had a little difficulty breathing again, but no worse than before. My arm was pretty sore from the injection, but no other symptoms had developed otherwise. By about 11am, I started feeling better, and by about 1:00pm I felt much better. I had low energy, but I otherwise felt good the rest of the day and slept fine again that night.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn't catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn't sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don't worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn't last long, sometimes she doesn't know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn't breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn't breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don't know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn't know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn't know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn't know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn't want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won't be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn't need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn't have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can't pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn't feel them then, she couldn't tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn't done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn't consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn't breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the vaccine and had been fine.

On 06Feb2021, she was fine, had a little fever in the morning, but about 3 in the afternoon, she started with pretty severe joint pain from her jaw to her ankles. She was recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and they put her on a chemo and a monoclonal antibody. One of the oncologists thinks it was a reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.

I was tested for COVID-19 and it came back negative. It resolved itself in about a month. About 8 hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine on 3/9/21 (about 6:30 p.m., I started to feel a slight headache. Because I had just had the vaccine, I was trying to avoid taking any pain medication, so I did not take anything for it. The headache got worse throughout the evening, and by 10 p.m. I would describe it as a moderate headache. It was primarily concentrated on the left side of my head towards the front, on my forehead and above the eyebrow. I went to bed without taking any pain medication. About 3 hours later, at about 1 p.m., I woke up, and the headache was much more intense. It felt like all the nerves around the left side of my face, including the nerve along my jaw line leading to the 7th cranial nerve that causes Bell's Palsy, were throbbing. I grew concerned about getting Bell's Palsy again, so at that time I took one ibuprofen Advil. After taking it, the headache subsided, although I continued to have a dull headache throughout the night and the next day. Patient received the vaccine Monday March 1st around 2:30pm. Patient began to feel arm soreness around 5pm, woke up at 3am the following morning with a severe headache and spent the next day resting. Wednesday morning March 3rd, the patient reported extreme fatigue, dizziness and feeling ""woozy"". As she was walking around the store, around 8:30am, patient had to request help as she almost fainted. Patient went home quickly after, reported dizziness until 3pm.

Severe pain. The pain seem to shift around like more nerve pain showing in the muscle . Started on the left side but moved around.  This was initially helped with some strong curcummin/boswella (inflammation pain formula at our health food store) and a homeopathic remedy. But the symptoms came back and kept going . She is very active and was unable to do her regular routine. She was sleeping more and in considerable pain. After several days, we tried what another country recommends for reactions to vaccines and it seemed to help her within a very short time. There is still now residual pain but she is better.

Also a great concern that the same amount of vaccine for a 250 pound person and a 100 pound elder. She is very tiny bones and weighs around 100 pounds are less. Very concerning as no medicine is usually the same for everyone. Also a concern of why just one month from second dose when it takes a known 6 weeks for blood to change. A high chance of severe reaction can happen with such a close proximity and a second dose. We would like to see advise of no second shot or considerable less for small people. CDC person recommended she switch vaccines?  That seems risky and there is no studies of adverse reaction to combining two different vaccines.  She would like to be comfortable moving around in public and is of great health for her age so this reaction was very concerning. If she had such a reaction on FIRST DOSE....wouldnt that be a indication that her body reacted and a second dose not necessary  advisable. Please advise.

1102345,03/15/2021,VA,33.0,33,,F,,"1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.",,,,,,,,,N,02/20/2021,02/20/2021,0,"2/25/2021 - Chest x-ray (which came back clear), blood work (which was normal), a Rapid Covid test (which was negative), and a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 -  Chest x-ray (which came back clear), blood work (which was normal aside from slight anemia), and an EKG (which was normal).  3/3 - Pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal).",WRK,,"Gabapentin, Tramadol, Sumatriptan, Hyoscyamine, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Ajovy, Botox injections Multi-vitamin, chaste tree, vitamin C, vitamin D, magnesium, Allegra, Tylenol",Cold,"Chronic migraines, anxiety/depression",,,2,03/15/2021,,Y,Y,Codeine

I swear this is not a joke. I'm flabbergasted.   The longer explanation:  Something I never talk about, partially because I am scared, is an issue with my eyes that started when I was 19. I am now 36.  My right pupil will dilate quite irregularly from my left. A bright light will correct it, but then it will start again after. I've mentioned it to eye doctors, and they brushed it off. Research only has scary answers, with no help, so I have learned to live with it.  It used to make me dizzy, nauseous, and I'd lay down. But over the years I've adjusted, and it doesn't bother me.  I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 3/11. Last night, 3/14, I became dizzy and faint.   Today, I still felt that way. I was splashing cold water on my face, when I realized, looking in the mirror, my pupils were exactly the same size! And maintained that same diameter.  I keep checking, but, so far, it's consistent.   I assume the dizziness, lack of balance, and slight faintness today is my body getting used to this, as it's been compensating for the difference for 12 years.  So, is this a positive side effect? A coincidence?

He went back to bed and went back to sleep - nothing further for 3 days. Then on 1/28/2021 he again began feeling nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. Again, it lasted a short time and was over.  Since then there have been 2 other episodes of random nausea, but this time without vomiting.  This is from a man who does not throw up EVER.  Then, sometime after the first shot, which was received 2 days after we returned from a trip to see family, he began having explosive diarrhea. Up until this time he had been suffering (for months or years) with chronic constipation - which we had been working with the doctor with to alleviate.

Didn't think much of it until dinner time when my jaw hurt everytime I took a bite of food.  Couldn't think of anything I did to cause it, and assumed it would get better soon. On Saturday, my jaw was still sore when I had lunch, but maybe a little better.  But then at dinner time it was back to hurting again.  Sunday it was still sore when  I had lunch.  By then I was starting to attribute it to possibly being the vaccine I received on 3/11, even though there was no mention of this as a side effect on any of the sheets I received when I got my vaccine.  I then signed-up to v-safe to see what they might offer. Then I called the on-call nurseline (where I got the shot).  An RN called back and we went over everything, and at the end she recommended I go into an Emergency room to get checked out because jaw paint can possibly mean heart issues or other things to be concerned about.  I was very surprised about her recommendation, but decided to take her advice.  Went to an emergency clinic.   While I was in the waiting room, a woman who was also waiting said she heard me talking about the reason I was in and said her husband had experienced the same symptoms after his Covid vaccine that I did!  He had a Moderna shot on 2/27 and then several days later his right jaw got sore.  He went to the doctor on 3/8 and they said he had TMJ, but the next day his pain went away and he has been ok since.  They examined me, took blood for Troponin, did an EKG.  All looked OK.  I told them about the person in the waiting room and her husband and they said they weren't aware that this was an issue with this vaccine.  They sent me home and said to monitor and follow-up with my family doctor if it persists.  As of today,  I am still having the pain in my right jaw.  It has stayed the same since it started - no better/no worse.

Then my face and head and shoulders and the back of my arms. I felt like I was flushing after a steroid shot with the pin prickly itching and very very very slight pink color to my skin. Eventually by the evening the itch moved to my bra line. I called my local pharmacy (since the urgent care center was closed) and was told to take benedryl or claritin and keep an eye on it. The ADULT dose of Claritin really helped to calm the majority of the itching. I itched a little yesterday and still itch in spots today but the Claritin is helping as is topical Cortaid.
