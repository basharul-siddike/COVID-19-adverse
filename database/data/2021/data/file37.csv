I researched this database and saw that there were 3 cases of aggression reported, and that sort of describes my mental state.  My direct supervisor on Monday did have a discussion about a not up to par job performance as of late.  When I got into work on Tuesday, I found myself in a mental state that I have never felt before.  I was stewing in my office, practically seething over what happened.  I convinced myself that I was going to be fired.  I aggressively had a discussion with my supervisor around 8AM.  Over the next 4 hours I started having incredibly irrational thoughts and felt like the walls were caving in around me.  I aggresively and angrily discussed the situation with my HR manager, told her I had to get out and think about what I wanted to do.  I emailed my boss an agressive email and stormed out.  I was subsequently fired around 1PM on Tuesday.  Although there were some obvious other things going on, I truly believe that I was in a mental state of agression, anxiety and irrationality that I have never felt before.  I am typically a laid back person and it takes way more than what happened to make me upset.  I woke up this morning, feeling much clearer headed wondering what I did and how things happened the way they did.  I do believe there is a good chance I had some sort of mental state change due to my second vaccine dose.  I did not seek medical attention for this episode.

She guesses she didn't put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn't come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn't remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn't remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI's, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn't think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn't understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn't understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.",,,,,Y,4,,,Y,01/29/2021,01/30/2021,1,See above.,PVT,,"Levothyroxine, baby aspirin, vitamin D3, Vitamin B12.",None.,"Thyroid disease, atrial fibrillation.",,,2,03/25/2021,,,,"Sulfa, codeine."

I have never experienced any health issues like this before and do not engage in any activities that would cause muscle pain. Additionally, I have a very high pain tolerance and am rarely bothered by aches or pains (and certainly never had an issue that required me to take Advil so regularly to control the pain).

He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV.

Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney.

Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn't take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn't treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don't bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021.

He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV �3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated ""At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker.

The vertebral body heights are maintained. There is intervertebral disc space narrowing of L5-S1. There are mild facet arthropathy changes. Soft tissues are unremarkable.   MRI LUMBAR SPINE 3/10/2021 FINDING:     Assuming 5 nonrib-bearing lumbar vertebral bodies, the conus terminates at L1-L2. Lumbar alignment is normal. Bone marrow signal is normal. There is no acute fracture. Vertebral body heights are preserved. There is multilevel disc height loss and decreased T2 disc signal throughout the lumbar spine. Visualized intra-abdominal structures are unremarkable. No intraspinal fluid collection. No abnormal enhancement of the marrow or cauda equina nerve roots. Visualized intra-abdominal structures, paraspinal muscles, sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.     T12/L1: No spinal canal narrowing. Small left foraminal disc protrusion with moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. This is only seen on the sagittal view.     L1/L2: Symmetric disc bulge with central disc protrusion. No spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.     L2/L3: Symmetric disc bulge. Annular fissure. Facet arthropathy. No spinal canal narrowing. Mild left and no right neural foraminal narrowing.     L3/L4: Symmetric disc bulge. Annular fissure. Facet arthropathy. No spinal canal narrowing. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.     L4/L5: Symmetric disc bulge. Facet arthropathy. Annular fissure. No spinal canal narrowing. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.     L5/S1:Symmetric disc bulge with central disc protrusion. Facet arthropathy. No spinal canal narrowing. Mild left and no right neural foraminal narrowing.     IMPRESSION:  1. Multilevel lumbar disc degeneration and facet arthropathy as discussed above. No high-grade spinal canal narrowing or evidence of nerve root impingement.  2. No abnormal enhancement.  3. No acute fracture.   MRI BRAIN 3/10/2021 FINDINGS:  No abnormal diffusion restriction to suggest acute infarct. The ventricles are normal in size. No mass effect or midline shift. No extra-axial fluid collection.     IMPRESSION:  1. No acute infarct.  2. No hydrocephalus. No mass effect or midline shift.   ------------------------------------------------------------------ CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 3/10/2021 FINDINGS:  Vascular: Heart size is normal. The visualized thoracoabdominal aorta are patent without high-grade stenosis or aneurysm. There is a focal outpouching involving the mid thoracic aorta on axial image 80 which could potentially represent a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. This measures 8 x 2 mm. There is no adjacent periaortic hematoma. There is moderate mixed atherosclerotic plaque involving the infrarenal abdominal aorta and side branches. Single bilateral renal arteries are patent without high-grade stenosis. The celiac artery, SMA, and IMA are patent. The common iliacs and external and internal iliac arteries are patent without high-grade stenosis or aneurysm. Visualized common femoral and superficial and deep femoral arteries are patent.     Nonvascular: Lung bases are clear. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically. There is no hydronephrosis. There is diffuse diverticulosis. There is focal wall thickening of the colon near the splenic flexure best seen on axial image 48 and coronal image 52. A few hyperdense foci within the splenic flexure large bowel could represent enhancement as there was recent gadolinium given. Normal-appearing appendix. There is no lymphadenopathy. There is trace free fluid in the left upper quadrant surrounding the colon with a few tiny adjacent lymph nodes. There is no free air. There is contrast within the bladder likely from recent gadolinium injection. There is no aggressive osseous lesion. There is a tiny sclerotic lesion left iliac bone which is nonaggressive potentially representing a fibro-osseous lesion. There is moderate disc degeneration at L5-S1.     3-D FINDINGS:  Patent abdominal aorta without aneurysm.     IMPRESSION:  1. Moderate atherosclerotic change involving the mid and distal abdominal aorta. There is a tiny focal outpouching measuring 8 x 2 mm in the mid abdominal aorta which is suspicious for a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. No periaortic hematoma. No aneurysm identified.     2. There is focal wall thickening of the colon at the splenic flexure suspicious for acute diverticulitis. A small amount of surrounding free fluid is present but no free air. Round hyperdense foci within the colon in this location may represent enhancement or previous hemorrhage given recent gadolinium injection. There is no evidence for active extravasation on this CTA. I would recommend a follow-up colonoscopy once symptoms resolve.    MRI CERVICAL AND THORACIC 3/12/2021 FINDINGS:  Cervical:  Alignment of the cervical spine is unremarkable. Edematous endplate degenerative change on the right at C5-C6. No marrow edema seen to suggest acute vertebral body fracture. There is facet and perifacet edema on the left at C7-T1 with minor listhesis. No abnormal cord signal.     C2-C3: No canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.     C3-C4: No canal stenosis. Mild left foraminal narrowing due to uncinate and facet degeneration. There is facet arthropathy on the right as well.     C4-C5: Uncinate and facet degeneration causes moderate right and mild left foraminal narrowing. Mild canal narrowing due to posterior disc osteophyte complex formation.     C5-C6: Loss of disc height and broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex formation. Bilateral facet and uncinate degeneration causing severe left and moderate to severe right foraminal narrowing.     C6-C7: Broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex formation contributes to mild canal narrowing. Uncinate and facet arthropathy causes mild left and right foraminal narrowing.     C7-T1: No canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.     No abnormal cord signal. No DWI hyperintensity within the cord.     Thoracic:  Alignment of the thoracic spine is normal. No canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing at any level. There does appear to be abnormal T2 hyperintensity within the right aspect of the cord at the level of T11. No cord expansion. While there is DWI hyperintensity within the right hemicord near this region, there is no definite ADC hypointensity.     IMPRESSION:  1. No high-grade canal stenosis in the cervical spine or abnormal cord signal.  2. Subtle linear T2 hyperintensity within the right dorsal lateral cord at the level of T11. This is nonspecific. Consider transverse myelitis or remote demyelination. No definite findings of cord infarct which would typically be more central and bilateral in distribution.   MRI THORACIC 3/12/2021 (re-image) FINDINGS:  Additional post contrast imaging performed to supplement the initial MRI of the thoracic spine performed earlier this morning which demonstrated subtle focal T2 signal changes in the right dorsolateral cord at the T11 level. Post contrast imaging shows minimal patchy surface enhancement along the dorsal cord at the T10-T11 levels (images 8 and 7 of series 801), at the level of the cord signal abnormality. No convincing correlate on the axial images. No additional areas of abnormal enhancement. Minimal thickening of the left adrenal gland is stable likely representing adenoma/hyperplasia.     IMPRESSION:  Minimal patchy surface enhancement along the dorsal cord at the T10-T11 level corresponding with the area of abnormal T2 signal on the concurrent MRI thoracic spine performed earlier today. This may be related to inflammation at this level versus normal vascular enhancement. Consider short-term imaging follow-up.",PUB,,aspirin 81 mg enteric coated tablet daily glucosamine-chondroitin 500-400 mg capsule daily ibuprofen 200-600 mg tablet as needed,None.,Premature beats.

I didn't initially report it as it was not one of the listed reactions I had read about in the information given to me -- I assumed I was very anxious, maybe breathing nervously, and that it would go away. The next day I felt very fatigued, light-headed, had extreme muscle and joint pain throughout my body, slight nausea, and the injection site (my left arm) was very sore. I took Tylenol and slept.  I felt weak and ""off"" the whole day. The acute chest pain I felt after the shot had now become less ""acute"" and turned into a wider and duller general pressure. The next day, Tuesday, I also began feeling intermittent flashes of hot or cold-like patches in my head, which I also consider a part of a general inflammation my body might be having. It is now Thursday, 3/25/2021 and the chest pressure has increased even more, having now spread from the upper right side to include the center of my chest. My headache is still lingering, I still don't feel like my normal self and feel ""off"" somehow, and the chest pressure is worrying me because I don't know what's going on internally. I reported the chest pain to my doctor and was told that my exact reactions don't make any sense in relation to the known adverse reactions to the Moderna COVID vaccine.

I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake.

She had the first dose of the Pfizer covid19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She is nervous. She lives with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, which means her blood is too thick.

States a stable reading is between 2 and 3. The only different thing she has had in her body is the vaccine. Reports she is nervous and scared. She had surgery on her feet and she has a wound where a thicker scab came off, states it is draining but not drying out. She was thinking maybe this was due to her her INR being high. She will see the surgeon tomorrow. She put a bandaid on her foot where the open wound on her foot is. The next morning she checked her foot and the bandaid was wet. She put some peroxide on it. She read peroxide is not good for open wounds because it kills good bacteria so she used gauze and placed it over the open wound with tape across it. Last month her warfarin dose was 6 mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week. As of today she is to take 3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week. Warfarin is 6mg tablet that is perforated, clarifies it can be broken in half. She does not think her new regimen that she was given today will bring her INR back in the range between 2 and 3.

(Same Literature article)  Abstract: On October 7, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant hemagglutinin quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) (Spodoptera frugiperda cell line; Flublok Quadrivalent) for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in individuals 18 years of age and older. Clinical trials did not reveal any major differences in adverse events or serious adverse events following Flublok Quadrivalent versus standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. To improve our understanding of the safety profile of this vaccine, we reviewed and summarized adverse event reports after Flublok Quadrivalent administration to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). Through June 30, 2020, VAERS received 849 reports after RIV4 vaccination. The vast majority (810; 95%) were nonserious. Among serious events, there were 10 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including 5 people who required mechanical ventilation and 2 people who died. Many allergic reactions were reported as non-serious, but required interventions to treat a life-threatening event, example: epinephrine, nebulizers, albuterol, glucocorticoids, and supplemental oxygen. Two people experienced a positive rechallenge (which are allergic reactions after repeated vaccination with RIV4), including a person who despite premedication with antihistamines developed respiratory difficulties, required epinephrine, and was transported to the emergency department. The occurrence of anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions in some individuals may reflect an underlying predisposition to atopy that may manifest itself after an exposure to any drug or vaccine and does not necessarily suggest that Flublok Quadrivalent is particularly allergenic. Post marketing safety surveillance will continue to be vital for understanding the benefits and risks of quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine.  This case involves a 65 years old female patient who experienced pulmonary abscess (lung abscess), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (cerebral haemorrhage), 60 to 70 percent stenosis of the coronary arteries (coronary artery stenosis), pulseless electrical activity, cardiogenic shock, aspiration event (aspiration) and takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy), after she received INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE [FLUBLOK QIV].  Past medical treatment, vaccination, family history and concomitant medication were not reported.  At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease and hepatic cirrhosis.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE [batch number, expiry date and other dosing details were not reported] for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious pulseless electrical activity, takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy), cardiogenic shock, aspiration event (aspiration), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (cerebral haemorrhage) and pulmonary abscess (lung abscess), 7 weeks following the administration of INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE.   The patient was resuscitated, hospitalized on an unknown date for the reported events and stabilized.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious 60 to 70 percent stenosis of the coronary arteries (coronary artery stenosis), (unknown latency) following the administration of INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE and no intervention was performed. Patient was hospitalized during this event.   Relevant laboratory test results included: On an unknown date: Catheterization cardiac- cardiac catheterization revealed 60-70 percent stenosis of the coronary arteries.  It was not reported if the patient received any corrective treatment.  At the time of reporting, event outcome was not reported for all the reported events.   There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involved a 65 years old female patient who presented with coronary artery stenosis, lung abscess, cerebral haemorrhage, pulseless electrical activity, cardiogenic shock, aspiration and stress cardiomyopathy after the administration of FLUBLOK QIV. Time of onset was unknown for coronary artery stenosis and compatible for remaining reported events. At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease and hepatic cirrhosis. Cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed serious 60-70% stenosis of the coronary arteries.

On Monday the 18th I had an appt with my doctor (a telehealth visit) and she looked at my arm and went over the symptoms and she felt it could have been a side effect to the vaccine.  I felt good during the day (no headaches during the day) and about 4PM I noticed that I started with a cough.

There was no rash, as in patients describing ""covid arm.""  It was not very painful, either.. but I did do a good job keeping my arm mobile for both vaccines.  Two weeks after Dose 1, I got a rash for the first time in my adult life (I'm almost 35 years old).  The rash was localized to be just on my ""seat"" area... literally.  That took over a week to dissipate, but eventually I didn't notice it.  One week after Dose 2, I woke up with red swollen hands, a swollen rash on the undersides of my forearms, a little on my stomach, and a little rash on just the instep arches of both feet.  The rash was spreading, so I was advised to go to a clinic.  Unfortunately, that clinic didn't do any bloodwork, but they sent me home with scripts for prednisone and famotidine thinking I was having an allergic reaction to the pizza I ate the previous night.  I also got a shot in the butt.  The rash and swelling dissipated by over 50% by the next morning.  However, after a day of work and movement, I realized the rash was still spreading and I was now gaining weight.   It is now 3/26, which is two weeks after receiving the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash is still spreading around my skin.  I completed my medication and now I am monitoring the rash on my own.  The oldest sites seem to be healing.

My arm was really bad. Everything lasted until 02/09. Arm got better on 02/10 (I was on antibiotics for 10 days). It took me a while to gain my strength back and not feel so fatigued.

1137651,03/26/2021,AR,35.0,35,,M,,"Then this past Tuesday (03-23-2021) I went to receive the 2nd Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine at 1:00pm. I felt fine and had no adverse after this vaccination until 8:30pm the same day. At this time I started to have sever  itching and within an hour the itching was over my entire body. It was a mixture of hives and regular pruritus/itching and areas of swelling throughout my body. This lasted all through the night into Wednesday, 03-24-21. Around the same time as the itching started Tuesday night, my Spinal joints, Hip joints, shoulder joints, knee joints, wrist and ankles became severely inflamed and very painful. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain, at the highest I was at a 9.    On Wednesday, I went in to my Primary Care for the itching and the pain. My PCP is on vacation this week, so I saw his Colleague. Dr. visibly recognized the redness from the itching all over my body, along with the extreme pain to my joints and gave me a thorough examination. After his examination  he spoke to another physician who stepped in and also gave me an exam. Dr. advised the other Dr. and me of  his initial hesitancy  sending me home, wanting me to be observed overnight at the Hospital. After going to their Emergency Room. They gave me the choice but I truly thought it would go away over the course of the usual 24 hours post Vaccination; I also did not want to be exposed to any virus/sickness I might encounter/pick up in the Hospital due to my lowered immune system because of the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira I take bi-monthly.. I explained that I was living with my mom, and our residence is 7 minutes from the Hospital, Emergency Room.) I assured both Physicians if it got worse, my mother would take me to the ER. So instead of going to Hospital, they prescribed a Hydrocortisone Cream of  2.5% for the itching, kept me on oral Benadryl and told me to stay hydrated. Also, Dr. said if it wasn?t better and/or worse Thursday(03/25/21)to come back in for re-evaluation. Along with the medications for itching, they prescribed a dose of pain medicine: Tylenol(APAP) #4 - or Acetaminophen with 60mg of Codeine.    Yesterday - Thursday(03-25-2021) I was no better, and had to go back in to the Clinic.  I was seen by Dr., who also believed this reaction to be based on the Humira along with my immune system naturally being lowered due to the AS and RA medication. Dr. examined me, as by yesterday my hands/fingers were hurting as well and itching was not any better. He prescribed Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 50mg Cap to be taken 3 times per day for the awful Pruritis, which has caused me to scratch so badly that I?ve had some bleeding from areas on my body, near the larger joints and spine. And also changed the Tylenol #4 to every 4 hours, basically more often for the pain associated.    Adding the Hydroxyzine for the itch along with the Hydrocortisone, pain medication and time since Tuesday?s final vaccine, has helped a bit. Today, Friday, I am feeling less itchy but still having quite a bit of joint pain, but less than Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  Because of the itching and joint/spine pain I received very little sleep until last evening when I was able to rest and not itch or toss and turn from pain.

Later, when she was 10 months old, she experienced severe influenza A pneumonia with very high fever and progressive respiratory failure despite treatment with oseltamivir (dose, route and frequency not reported), ceftriaxone (dose, route and frequency not reported), methylprednisolone (dose, route and frequency not reported), and oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation for 3 days but recovered on an unknown date.  After that, on an unknown date, when she was 12 months old she was vaccinated with varicella virus vaccine live (oka/merck)(manufacturer unknown), along with measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (manufacturer unknown), hepatitis a vaccine, inactivated (manufacturer unknown), hib conj vaccine (unspecified carrier) and pneumococcal 13v conj vaccine (crm197) (administration routes, doses and frequencies were not reported), all of them for prophylaxis. It was mentioned that, during vaccination, the patient showed nasal congestion and clear rhinorrhea.  Then, 6 days after vaccinations, the patient presented with high fever, diarrhea, new onset vomiting, nasal congestion, cough, irritability, and lethargy.  On an unknown date, the patient was hospitalized. Then, a partial septic screen yielded above 100000 colony forming units/ml of Escherichia coli from her urine and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rhinovirus/enterovirus RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab sample showed positive results. The patient's high fever continued despite intravenous ceftriaxone for presumed pyelonephritis, and she was on the pediatric ward for 2 days with continuing high fever up to 41�C.  On day 3, she was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) because of poor bilateral lower extremity perfusion that failed to improve on multiple fluid boluses. This was accompanied by persistent tachycardia, increased work of breathing, and a diffuse erythematous rash. On the 4th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL (normal range between 10.2 to 14.7 g/dL); hematocrit of 34.4 percent (normal range between 30.8 to 43.7 percent); White blood cell count 7.6 x10x9/L (normal range between 6 to 17.5 x10x9/L); Absolute neutrophil count of 4 x10x9/L (normal range between 1.5 to 8.5 x10x9/L); Absolute lymphocyte count 2.3 x10x9/L (normal range between 4 to 10.5 x10x9/L(decreased)); Absolute monocyte count 1.2 x10x9/L (normal range between 0.3 to 0.9  x10x9/L (increased)); Platelet count 242 x10x9/L (normal range between 150 to 450 x10x9/L); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 66 U/L (normal range between 10 to 37 U/L (increased)); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 57 U/L (normal range between 5 to 30U/L (increased)). Also, a blood culture collected on day 4 and it was sterile.  On an unknown date, on the 6th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL; hematocrit of 30.1 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 3.5 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 2.2 x10x9/L; Absolute lymphocyte count 1 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count 0.2 x10x9/L (decreased)); Platelet count 144 x10x9/L (decreased); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 57 U/L (increased); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 38 U/L (increased); C-reactive protein 76 mg/dL (normal range between 0 to 0.8 mg/dL(increased)). Also, a blood culture was collected on day 6 and it was sterile. In addition, virology investigations were consistent with human herpes virus type 6 (HHV6) reactivation, based on positive blood PCR (23,500 (log 4.4) copies/ml of HHV-6 type B), positive HHV6 IgG at 1:80 (negative if below 1:10) and negative IgM (below 1:20) on day 6. On the 7th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 29.2 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 2.3 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 1.2 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute lymphocyte count 1 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count 0.1 x10x9/L (decreased)); Platelet count 127 x10x9/L (decreased). On the 8th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 26.9 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 1.4 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 0.8 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute lymphocyte count 0.6 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count 9.1 x10x9/L (increased)); Platelet count 107 x10x9/L (decreased). On the 9th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 27 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 1.5 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 0.8 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute lymphocyte count 0.7 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count  0 x10x9/L (decreased)); Platelet count 85 x10x9/L (decreased); AST 221 U/L (increased); ALT 100 U/L (increased); Ferritin 1980 ng/dL (normal range between 12 to 207 ng/dL(increased)); Lactate dehydrogenase1043 U/L  (normal range between 190 to 420 U/L (increased)); Triglycerides 289 mg/dL (normal range between 30 to 120 mg/dL (increased)). An attempt at bone marrow aspiration on day 9 of admission was aborted due to apnea and profound desaturation. She was quickly resuscitated and returned to baseline within a few hours while hematologic parameters began spontaneously improving by day 10.  Also on 10th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 26.3 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 2.7 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 1.1 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute lymphocyte count 1.3 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count  0.2 x10x9/L (decreased)); Platelet count 85 x10x9/L (decreased); AST 125 U/L (increased); ALT 94 U/L (increased); D-dimer above 9999 ng/ml (normal range between 0 to 499 (increased)); fibrinogen 71 mg/dL (normal range between 175 to 375 mg/dL (decreased)); Soluble interleukin-2 receptor 14740 pg/mL (normal range lower than 1034 (increased). Persistent high fever was accompanied by worsening cytopenia's, elevated triglycerides, elevated ferritin to equal or higher than 500 ng/ml, and elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor level. These results met 5 of 8 criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymph histiocytosis (HLH). Treatment with corticosteroids and other unspecified immunomodulators was planned after the bone marrow aspiration, but not administered because of clinical and laboratory evidence suggestive of spontaneous HLH resolution on day 10.  On the 11th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 25.7 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 3.5 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 1.4 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute lymphocyte count 1.7 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count  0.3 x10x9/L; Platelet count 101 x10x9/L (decreased); AST 104 U/L (increased); ALT 85 U/L (increased); fibrinogen 65 mg/dL (decreased). On the 12th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 8.1 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 24.5 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 5.6 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute neutrophil count of 2.4 x10x9/L; Absolute lymphocyte count 2.6 x10x9/L (decreased); Absolute monocyte count  0.4 x10x9/L; Platelet count 135 x10x9/L (decreased); AST 82 U/L (increased); ALT 78 U/L (increased). On the 15th day after the onset of fever, she underwent several laboratory tests, which result were reported as follows: hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL (decreased); hematocrit of 27.3 percent (decreased); White blood cell count 9.1 x10x9/L; Absolute neutrophil count of 3.1 x10x9/L; Absolute lymphocyte count 24.6 x10x9/L; Absolute monocyte count 0.7 x10x9/L; Platelet count 534 x10x9/L (increased); AST 73 U/L (increased); ALT 55 U/L (increased). All the laboratory results were assessing as unremarkable. On an unknown date, the patient underwent ultrasonography, repeated plain x-radiography, contrast computerized tomogram (CT) and echocardiography which results showed no evidence of an infective focus in the renal tract, chest, abdomen/pelvis, or heart, respectively. The diagnosis was considered to be transient HLH triggered by HHV6 infection. Fever abated after 15 days and the child was discharged on no antibiotics.  On an unknown date, 20 days after vaccinations and immediately after hospital discharge, she developed a diffuse vesicular rash from which varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA was detected by PCR. The patient received treatment with acyclovir 20 mg/kg every 6 h, for 5 days, without complication.  The outcome of disseminated varicella zoster vaccine virus infection was reported as recovered. The reporter considered disseminated varicella zoster vaccine virus infection to be related to varicella virus vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (VARIVAX) as they considered tht it was more consistent with vaccine-strain varicella, than a wild type varicella.  Upon internal review, the event Disseminated varicella zoster vaccine virus infection was considered to be medically significant.

I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body.

The mass vaccination process began on 02/17/2021.    Quality assurance processes in place for this vaccination effort identified two concerns regarding the vaccination process that occurred at seven facilities between the dates of 02/24/2021 and 03/05/2021.  Based on the information obtained, seven sites varied from the recommended best practices during the first round of vaccinations. A total of 5150 doses were provided to correctional staff and inmates in these seven facilities.    Our observations: o Based on our estimates of the number of doses per vial, it is possible that some recipients of the vaccine in these seven facilities may have received a lower than authorized dose of the vaccine.  o At two specific facilities, vaccine pooling did occur.  o There were no adverse outcomes reported from any of these facilities.   We gathered detailed information from all our vaccination sites.  We reviewed and analyzed this information and reported these observations to both Moderna, and to the agency. The conclusion of these meetings was that these variations in vaccine administration will have no impact on the vaccine's ability to provide protection and pose no ongoing risk to vaccine recipients.   We implemented the following modifications to improve our process: o Provided staff education regarding COVID-19 vaccination best practices o Established centralized dose preparation by health care staff at each facility o Included additional in-service dose preparation training for nursing staff by staff who were trained by Moderna o Initiated additional data collection by health care staff o Analyzed and monitored collected data to determine effectiveness of modifications   We will complete the required Vaccine Adverse Event Report (VAERs) to the agency.

A 65-year-old woman attended the hospital with a 1-day history of fever and falls, saying that her legs had given out from under her. The patient's symptoms began within 1 day of the first dose of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. She had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes. On examination in the emergency department, the patient's temperature was 39.1�C, her respiratory rate was 25 breaths per min, and her heart rate was 88 beats per min. As she met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), an extensive infection work-up was initiated and she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Laboratory investigations found a D-dimer concentration of 5267 ng/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 69 mm/h, and a C-reactive protein concentration of 63.4 mg/L. The patient's white blood cell count, lactate, urinalysis, respiratory pathogen panel including SARS-CoV-2 and urine and blood cultures were unremarkable. Due to concerns of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the PCR test was repeated after 24 h, but this was again negative. CT of the patient's chest showed multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 1.1 cm. A small filling defect in a distal subsegmental pulmonary artery was also seen, which the authors thought was inconsistent with an acute pulmonary embolism and probably artifactually. Doppler ultrasounds of the patient's lower limbs were normal; her head CT was also normal. 4 days after presentation, fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/CT was done to characterize the pulmonary nodules; it showed uptake in the fat stranding posterior to the right deltoid; moderately increased uptake within multiple right axillary lymph nodes; and diffusely increased splenic uptake. The pulmonary nodules had no uptake-indicating that they were probably benign. The patient's symptoms resolved 3 days after the vaccination. Given the imaging findings, the temporal relationship of the symptoms to the vaccination, and negative test results from an extensive work-up for malignant and infectious causes, the authors believe, the diagnosis was a local and systemic immune response following vaccination. However, possible masking effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics cannot be excluded. The high D-dimer concentration probably reflected significant concomitant coagulation and fibrinolysis associated with SIRS. The local response was demonstrated by hypermetabolism within the axillary lymph nodes draining the site of intramuscular injection; diffusely increased splenic activity suggests a systemic response- corroborated by elevated inflammatory markers. As the global vaccination effort continues, more patients will undoubtedly require assessment and investigation shortly after immunization. Imaging and laboratory findings consistent with a systemic immune response might result in further unnecessary evaluation or interventions. However, findings overlap with other diseases- notably those of the F-FDG PET/CT scan in patients with malignancies. Recognition of the clinical and imaging features of the systemic immune response to vaccination might become essential in the coming months.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.
