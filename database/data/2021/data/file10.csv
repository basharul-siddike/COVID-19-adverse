I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit.

The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection.

I initially wasn't convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October.

The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better.

I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness.

I reported daily symptoms (there were none other than day 2) through V-SAFE but the survey ended and now I have to report here. FYI it's really not a good idea to end that survey after a week. I read on the CDC website ""?Delayed injection-site reactions (those with onset on or after day 8) were noted in 244 participants (0.8%) after the first dose and in 68 participants (0.2%) after the second dose. Reactions were characterized by erythema, induration, and tenderness, and they resolved over the following 4 to 5 days.?  Perhaps the reason that onset after day 8 is so rare, is because V-safe stops asking around day 8 and participants are blocked from reporting further.

I saw [vaccine administrator] and she instructed me to use ice and hydrocortisone cream.  I iced it for 4 days and there was no change until day 4 (Sunday). I also used Aleve during this time as well. I saw my PCP on Monday 1/18 and she told me to continue the current treatment of ice and Alieve and to update her on Wednesday 1/20.""",,,,,,,,,U,01/06/2021,01/14/2021,8,,WRK,,,,,,,2,01/25/2021,,Y,,

She was healthy, non-diabetic. Her medical history, concomitant medications, previous drugs or allergies were not provided.  Several autoimmune disorders have been linked to vaccination. One that stood out was Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following ""influenza vaccine"" (unspecified). Molecular mimicry was a proposed mechanism. As opposed to GBS, the vasculitic neuropathy was a rare subtype of immune-mediated neuropathy. It might or might not have been associated with systemic vasculitis. The most common phenotype was multifocal neuropathy known as mononeuritis multiplex. To the best of knowledge, distal symmetric axonopathy due to vasculitic neuropathy has not been described following pneumococcal vaccination.  On an unknown date, previously healthy, non-diabetic woman developed purpuric rash 3 days after she received a Pneumococcal Vaccine, Polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) (dose, strength, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis. The rash was biopsied showing vasculopathy. For persistent eosinophilia, that was noted after vaccination, she underwent bone marrow biopsy without any evidence of malignancy. On an unspecified date, she developed acute onset lower extremity weakness worse in distal muscles. She became non-ambulatory prompting her admission to neurology service. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal, spine magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI) were negative. Nerve Conduction Studies (NCSs) and Electromyography (EMG) revealed acute axonal neuropathy (also reported as distal symmetric axonal neuropathy). She was treated with intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (Ig) for possible axonal GBS without any improvement. On an unknown date, a radial sensory nerve biopsy was undertaken showing perivascular lymphocytes in the epineurial connective tissue. Rheumatology was consulted and confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The patient was treated with high dose corticosteroids (unspecified), cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine. The outcome of the events was not reported (unknown).  Vasculitic neuropathy was a rare entity. When it occurred, the typical presentation was multifocal neuropathy. This case described the unique case of vasculitic neuropathy, that developed in the setting of Pneumococcal Vaccine, Polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) vaccination and presented as a distal symmetric axonal neuropathy causing weakness.

Immediately there was a throbbing pain in my shoulder and I told her and she said  ""You are having a reaction, there is a large wheal.""

This started the day the soreness started. The following day and up till now I felt very tired and like I needed to take a nap. Due to work I have not been able to nap. On Sunday I noticed I had a fever blister on the right side of face, under my lip by my chin. It looked like a herpes blister. I rarely get them unless there is a serious stressor to my body or if my body is emotionally stressed. Valacyclozir I took 4 of those in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening after noticing them. I put a cream on the blister. On Tuesday or Wednesday 3 or 4 days after the vaccine I felt a pain in my gum by back two teeth, the gums were very painful when I brushed my teeth or put my tongue on it.  I went to the dentist Friday the 22nd, however the dentist said it was intraoral herpes that he believes it is looked to the vaccine. Dr. believes the COVID vaccine activated the dormant herpes in my system . He said says it is located over the Greater Palatine Foramen.  The herpes on my chin went away. I still feel light sensitivity and fatigued. Dr recommended to see my dermatologist. Either the 22nd or 23rd I had a virutal appointment with my dermatologist. She recommended I take 4 Valacyclozir in the AM and PM. And then 1 day for 10 days. Both doctors recommended not getting the 2nd dose until the herpes vaccine goes away.

Clean injection into deltoid muscle bulk. Second shot, injection shot extremely high above main muscle bulk of the deltoid into area of supraspinatus tendon one finger below acromial shelf. First shot, two sensations: initial puncture then injection. Shot 2 one huge painful bump met with resistance in my tissue.  Also Shot 2 not one response except mild fatigue still today, but no pain in upper arm unless I pressed specifically into injection site itself.  WAS THIS VARIATION IN INJECTION SITE ACCEPTABLE? WAS IT OK TO DO INJECTION SO VERY HIGH UP? Secondly, had a wonderful, professional nurse, but I question the practice of retrieving a dose for me that comprised of doses left over at bottom(s) of other vial(s). We had a new vial in the office where I was, but she left and came back with a syringe already full, saying that it was important to use up every drop. At first I agreed, but now I question this practice and just want to make sure I don't need to come back for another second dose. Are there no substrates that would settle out of the solution as the vial gets depleted of everything except only a bit of fluid left in it? Is retrieving every last drop from each vial and putting them together to make a dose acceptable practice? if not, from the Pfizer standpoint, then I should get another dose? I am a pediatric physical therapists working within 1-2 feet a children's faces at all times and transmissibility is a real issue both ways in my job.

Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.

I have never experienced anything like this numbness  before in my life, and I am 99% positive it is due to receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I did not find facial numbness as a possible side effect of the vaccine listed, so I searched ?facial numbness COVID vaccine? and was able to find that only  4 of the 30,000 participants in the Moderna trials experienced facial numbness, and that only 3/4 received that active vaccine over the placebo, and so was not considered to be a side effect of the vaccine. I also read that they appeared to be cases of Bell?s Palsey, which I do not believe to be what I am experiencing, because I do not seem to have any symptoms of drooping, just a numb sensation. I woke up around 4:30AM on Wednesday (got vaccine on Monday at 2:30pm) with my lower right lip completely numb. The lower left lip had full feeling, as did my entire upper lip. Friday afternoon (2 days later on the 15th) I finally started to get some feeling back on the inside on my lower right lip. Over the next week (it?s been 12 days now since I first woke up with my lip numb), I have slowly regained a little more sensation each day. While I have about 95% of my feeling/sensation back in my lower right lip, there is still some numbness. Also important to note that while this symptom has been annoying, it has not been painful in any way.   An adverse side effect that happened immediately after getting the vaccccine was that my arm started to itch around the injection site, spanning about 3 inches out in every direction. My arm also got very slightly puffy (only right at the injection site), and moderately pink/red in the same area. They kept me just a little longer than the 15 minutes, but I had no breathing issues, and stated that I felt fine, and was able to leave.   Adverse side effects that started day one of getting the vaccine and lasted 2-3 days: -Severe cotton mouth/dry mouth and throat that started on my drive home about 40 minutes after receiving the injection  -Severe fatigue that started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine (could not even keep eyes open the first day, and had to call out of work for the next two days) -Moderately severe arm numbness at the site of injection that I noticed around 6 hours after injection.

She believes that the syringe did not contain any vaccine as it appeared clear and she could not see any cloudy fluid in the vaccines. Her statement:  I want to let you know that it took lots of courage for me to speak up, but as you said, we have to be our own health advocates. As you requested, I have included an account of my appointment that occurred yesterday, 01/14/2021.   I was scheduled to receive the Moderna vaccine on 01/14/2021 at 1:20 pm. When I was finally attended, I sat at station. I was first patient that afternoon, and while she got acquainted with the template of the note, I focused my attention on the vial of Moderna vaccine that was placed in front of me. I noticed that the solution was a white, cloudy color, and being as excited as I was, I asked if it was okay to take a picture of it as a memory.   After going through the entire vaccine questionnaire, then began to draw the syringe. As she drew the solution, I noticed that the syringe looked clear, as if the vaccine solution had not been drawn into the syringe, and instead, air filled the syringe. At that point, I had some doubt that may not have drawn the solution. However, given the power dynamic and the vulnerability of the moment, I did not speak up because I did not want to question  technique, especially not in front of all the other people in the room. As she administered the vaccine on my left arm, I felt the needle pinch, and that was it.   I was then taken to for the 30-minute observation, and after 30 minutes, I felt fine. My left arm felt heavy post-vaccination, but that feeling only lasted an hour. That night, I began to press on my left arm, and to my surprise, I felt no pain or soreness. However, I believed that the following morning I would feel the soreness that I experience after I get vaccines.   Today, I have rubbed my arm, and I do not feel any pain or soreness associated with the site of vaccination. Further, I cannot distinguish where the vaccine was administered on my arm as I cannot sense pain, discomfort, and soreness. This added to my concern and suspicion that I perhaps did not receive a dose. The final incidents that led me to speak to you were when coworkers asked me if my arm was just as sore as their arm. Every person who shared their experience with me reported experiencing some level of local arm soreness and tenderness.   It has now been more than 24 hours since I was administered the Moderna vaccine, and I still do not feel a sore arm, nor any of the common side effects. I understand that every person is different and that we all react differently; however, I cannot shake off the feeling that I might not have received a dose.   As I posed the question earlier today, can an antibody test be done in a few weeks to determine if my body received the dose? I am aware that Dr. will be reaching out to Moderna, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.   Lastly, I want to say that I have no doubts about as a provider, but mistakes can and do happen in this field all the time. I want to point out that eased my nerves during my appointment, and I am grateful for her warm and caring approach during my appointment. Nevertheless, given the heightened rates of COVID infections throughout the community, I want to be certain that I have some level of protection against this dangerous virus that has taken so many lives.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/14/2021,01/14/2021,0,N/a,SCH,,unknown,None,unknown,,,2,01/25/2021,,,,NKDA

CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely."" 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6.

"" 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: ""This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC>4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient's presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient's chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving."" 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued.

The next few days I had pain in my arm and it hurt to lift it.  As well I had pain in my elbow and shoulder joints. Stomach issues and a headache followed.  About 8 days after my injection, my arm swelled up, bright red and tender to touch with a fever. Noted small red welt encompassing injection site and about a 1/2 dollar coin size red mark (similar to the one above).  It continued to spread across my upper arm and the swelling was quite significant. Went to the doctors, they thought it was Cellulitis and treated for this. However, after 5 days being on antibiotics it was back with a vengeance. This time it started on outer and inner part of my arm; welts on back of arm and rash on part of arm closest to chest; it burned, itched like crazy and was again feverish. Back to the doctors, doctor thought it odd that it came back even though I have 5 more days of antibiotics to take and stated she believes it to be a post injection site reaction (not necessarily an allergic reaction, but definitely a reaction to either the need or what was in the needle). I was put on another antibiotic, prednisone and benadryl. This was Wednesday 1/13/2021 (2 weeks after my vaccine, noticed the welts on Tuesday 1/12/2021) and today is 1/17/2021; it is still very much there.  Less red, less irritated, less painful...still quite itchy.  With that said, doctor advised not to get the shot, but if I decide to I need to take benadryl and ibuprofen before the shot and be monitored for another reaction, possibly worse than this one. I also spoke to the place where I got my vaccine and they advised the same per-steps before getting the second dose on 1/28/2021.",,,,,,,,,,12/31/2020,01/08/2021,8,,UNK,,"sulfamethozazole, cephalexin, predisone ibuprofen, benadryl",,pulmonary stenosis,,,2,01/17/2021,,Y,,"opioids, tramadol, naproxene, latex, adhesive and iodine"

Start to get body aches, fatigue, headache, congestion and sore throat. The fatigue, body ache, congestion, sore throat and headache progressed/got worse into the 24th and 25th. By the 26th the symptoms had went away. The evening of December 29th, I noticed an intense itching in my left deltoid (which was my injection site). When I went to itch the area I could feel how hard the area was through my clothing. I looked at the area and it was indurated, erythematous and warm to the touch. It was approximately 5x3cm area. The itching continue to intensify going down my arm and up my neck. Over the next several days, I started to develop congestion, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, joint pain, headaches and the symptoms intensified. Friday January 8th, I was in severe pain and unable to walk that well. I went to rheumatology where I was given both oral and IM steroid to try to calm down the reaction and was told that was thrown into a full blown lupus flare. Restarted on methotrexate. Friday and Saturday improved slightly. Monday was difficulty to was due to pain and fatigue, not able to walk that well. Tues/Wednesday.

Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn't sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn't really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That's when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn't get enough water in me.   Now I'm scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month.

The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 06Jan2021 09:40 at a single dose as COVID vaccine. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications noted as on other medications but nothing new. She previously got the shingle shot for immunization then her arm hurt a few days. She had no other reaction to vaccines in the past. She received no vaccine on the day of or in the prior 4 weeks. Last Wednesday on 06Jan2021, the patient took the vaccine and has had a headache since; even touching her head hurts. She had a persistent headache that started the day after the vaccine and has continued since. The next day on 07Jan2021 was when the headache started. She took regular Motrin (lot OFE3249A, expiry: May2022) and Tylenol extra strength (lot: LMA051, expiry: Jul2019, perhaps not working anymore) sometimes but they didn't really seem to help. She felt the best when she was standing up or laying down, and she would rather be laying down. She asked ""Is this a normal side effect, am I dying? I am not a headache kind of person, I take a Motrin, it goes away and I do not have one for months. It actually hurts to the touch."" Should she be worried? She did call the clinic about the headache and was told if it got serious to go to the emergency room, she didn't think it was that serious. It was just persistent. She could leave with the pain if it kept her from getting COVID but the fact it was persistent worried her. It was also reported that on 06Jan2021 with this shot her arm really hurt when getting it and that day but that was all (pain in the arm the shot was given), the next night there was no pain. Her and her husband both oooo'd and ahhhh'd with the pain in the arm but that was it (a very uncomfortable pain they experienced in their arm after receiving the injection). She asked how long a side effect lasts after the vaccine? She also stated that on Jan2021, they insist on giving the next dose in 4 weeks. Asked if the vaccine was given a week later would the efficacy be lower?

She would hate to relate it to the vaccine when it could be a simple thing. Does not want to deter people from getting the vaccine. The other agent she spoke to said out of 40,000 injections nobody had that issue. One person had a problem in the leg. Caller doesn't think it is a characteristic of the injection. She thinks it is more the administration. She thinks she better ask her physician regarding the physiology of that. Maybe it bruised a nerve. Caller declined to do a report.
