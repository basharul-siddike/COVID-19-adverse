She reported that she was not feeling bad before taking the shot and nobody was telling her what to do about it. She was asking what she should do about her symptoms of joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue after getting her first vaccination on 22Dec2020. She was crying and stated that her boss can't tell her anything, she doesn't want to go to her doctor because, what was he going to tell her. She doesn't want to waste a copay. She reported taking Advil and Tylenol for her joint pain without relief and asked what else she should do. She stated she wanted directions, she doesn't want people reading off of a card. She stated she shouldn't have to pay a copay and she doesn't want more medicine to mask her symptoms, she wanted an answer. Additionally, the patient was calling about Pfizer COVID shot, she took first dose 22Dec2020, had a reaction, 35 minutes after she sat for 30 minutes, she works at a hospital, and she walked out to her car, she got sick and nauseous, then after the shot, she had flu like symptoms that lasted, and the next day was terrible, it lasted another week and a half, then she took the second shot 11Jan2021, to this day, she still has restless leg syndrome, fatigue, and her joints were hurting her. She had the same thing before, but this hurts a lot worse, and it was not going away, she was taking Turmeric, everything, and everyone says to just keep taking Tylenol or Advil but she can't keep taking it because now it was upsetting her stomach, or like arthritis medicine, she was taking Omega 3, vitamins, she was 52 years old, she does Spartan races, Cross fit, she does paleo and keto eating, if one looks at her they wouldn't know she was 52, and she was hurting everyday and doesn't know what else do to, and doctors weren't knowledgeable, she doesn't want a stupid answer. She called work, the CDC knows about it, now VAERS, and they said to call Pfizer, when she calls her doctor she doesn't want to pay a copayment and get an idiotic answer. She got this because she works at a hospital and she was trying to protect herself and everyone else, she doesn't like feeling this way, it was to the point she was getting angry, not at Pfizer, but she gets up and runs, with her dog, she was busy all the time, she has 3 boys in the military, and she meets up to do obstacles with them, but she doesn't feel like doing crap and was miserable everyday. She was a CNA in nursing school. She doesn't know if she even wanted to see her doctor, she doesn't want to get an idiotic answer. She hasn't seen him in while, she switched insurance, been primary for years. Stated this was her first day speaking to DSU before she decides what else to do after this, she was angry. Stated about 35 minutes after the first shot, after 30 minutes they said she could go, she said ok, she walked out to her car, was nauseous and threw up and didn't eat that morning, and the next day, she felt like she was in a car accident, that was how bad she felt, she had cold chills, flu like stuff that night before, she runs low like 96.6 to 96.8 and she took her temperature, she got in a blanket and went to bed that night, she was 95.5, and didn't bother taking another temperature, she took a bunch of Advil and went to bed, and Benadryl to go to sleep. This all started on 22Dec2020, and it took about 2 weeks, she just had joint pain, not like now, but those days she didn't feel good, but by the third week she was ok, and she went to take the second shot next time, and all hell broke loose. The second shot was 11Jan2021, and that night it she noted her joints were starting all over again, and she had restless leg syndrome, cold chills and everything, so she went to bed, she didn't have Benadryl, so she got up, and that night took Tylenol, she didn't get very much sleep, and she was very annoyed the next day, she felt like the first time, that like she got it an accident, feeling terrible, that night, and she can lay on the couch to relax, but with the restless leg syndrome, and her joints all day long, she just went yesterday to buy Advil Arthritis, and she never had arthritis before or anything. Restless leg syndrome depends, sometimes it was better than other time. Joint pain was not improving, she was so aggravated about that, she was not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn't look like she feels good, she doesn't, and she was ready to bite their heads off, she was very active, always in the gym or something, she has 3 kids in the military, and was always meeting up with them to do military runs and just this was ridiculous.

The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn't feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn't had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn't, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed.

The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don't really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn't feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work.

Medical history included anxiety. It was reported that the patient was ""physically fit. She was thin and was about 5 feet."" Ongoing concomitant medications included escitalopram (reported as ""generic Lexapro"") for anxiety, calcium, and multivitamins. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020. She also had her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 10:30 AM for COVID-19 immunization and felt a little soreness in arm and light headache the same day. Two nights later, her scalp felt on fire and had tingling sensation in her face for three weeks. A week after the first dose, her blood pressure went up to 210/101. She went to the hospital, they controlled her pressure and put her on a pressure pill 1 a day (amlodipine). She mentioned she had felt a weird sensation and noticed some spikes in her blood pressure. Her physician told her to take another 2.5 mg amlodipine if needed. After her second dose, she went to sleep with achy arm. she woke up that night with a tingling sensation from head to toe. Her whole body was tingling. It was a weird and scary on and off sensation. She stated it had improved during the past two days. The patient confirmed that she had no heart rate problems. She actually experienced high blood pressure instead. She never had numbness, instead she had a tingling sensation still present. She mentioned her 97-year-old mother and husband both got the two doses with no complication or reactions. The patient's cousin was ""pretty sure that it's Guillain-Barre.""

Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.

I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn't take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn't want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn't even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn't fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven't had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs.

On the day of my first Pfizer shot, the Efudex treated lesion was progressing normally from the desquamation (scabbing and shedding of epithelial scales) to the erosion stage (starting to form a shallow 2.5-cm-diameter ulcer). Starting about Saturday 30 January (three days after the first Pfizer shot) and slowly increasing for the next four days, the Efudex-treated ulcer became deeper, the peripheral 12-cm-diameter skin became redder, and the left foot and ankle became increasingly swollen.  My RN-wife and I (a former medical-research physicist) began research andChronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg & foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral. Chronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg & foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral.DVERSE EFFECTS, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOME:  discovered that Efudex should not be given concurrently with any of a long list of immunizations.  This is an Efudex problem that should gain another immunization onto that list. Being within a week of finishing the Efudex regimen, we monitored the Efudex-treatment area and the peripheral area carefully. On Thursday 4 Feb (eight days after the first Pfizer shot), the ulcer began unusual drainage, the 12-cm-diameter peripheral area became inflamed, and swelling of the left ankle and foot increased to almost skin-tight - I can upload photos if you need.  Time for immediate action.  My excellent Dermatologist stopped Efudex and started me on Bactrim by mouth for 10 days, and Gentamicin topical antibiotic on the ulcerated central area and Triamcinolone topical corticosteroid on the peripheral and swollen areas for three weeks.  Good choices.  Improvement was immediate and continued improving for the next three weeks.  By the time of the second Pfizer shot on 24 February, the central area was healing well, in the late-reepithelialization stage (regrowth of epithelial tissue that now formed a completely-covering scar tissue with no oozing), and with all inflammation and swelling completely gone.  After the second Pfizer shot (taken 20 days after stopping Efudex), there were zero adverse effects of any kind. NOTE: There were absolutely zero other adverse effects of any kind throughout the entire series: no chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in pulse or blood pressure (120/70 range), loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, lung congestion, fatigue, feeling of being unwell, shortness of breath, injection-site swelling or redness, hives, swelling of face, decreased kidney function, or other adverse cardiovascular, neurological or pulmonary effects. There was no additional joint pain above my normal osteoarthritis.  After both shots, I felt a slight normal-range injection-site soreness for the next few hours, but no site swelling, rash, redness, or other problem.

He was monitored by nursing staff for 15 minutes and had no adverse reaction or side effects. At approximately 1030am, Offender  was called to the officer's desk and was told to report to the visiting room for vaccination. Upon arrival, offender  was again vaccinated in the opposite arm. Offender was called in error rather than his room mate was who was an add on to the vaccination list. Offender was admitted to the Health Care Unit for observation for 24 hrs. Vital signs remained stable throughout this period with only a complaint of bilateral sore arms.  There were nono additional sequelae. Office of Health Services was notified of the incident on February 25, 2021 and began a review as part of our quality improvement process and in order to recommend practice modifications, provide education, implement policy change, monitor outcomes and prevent re-occurrence.  OHS reviewed information obtained from Moderna regarding the management of vaccine administration errors.  The error at facility is known as an ""invalid dose"".  In general there is limited information, yet low risk, for individuals who either receive a second dose within 21 days or a higher than authorized dose volume. The recommendations in this guidance related to the facility occurrence are summarized:  Second dose administered in < 21 days  Do not repeat dose. Higher than authorized dose volume administered  Do not repeat dose. * � Inform the recipient of the potential for local and systemic adverse.    Additional recommendations from the process:   1. Identity verification.  There were several opportunities for Health Care Staff, Security Staff, and  Guardsmen to confirm the identify of Offender. a. All offenders must wear their ID throughout all steps of the vaccination process.   b. Health Care Staff, Security Staff, andGuardsmen must verify offender identities as needed for their assignments throughout each step the vaccination process c. Health care staff must verify accurate completion of offender vaccination forms and ensure that forms match the offender being vaccinated.  d. Health care and Security staff must identify offenders by offender name and number rather than housing assignment. e. Use of handwritten lists should be minimized.  Other pre-printed available rosters or spreadsheets are preferable 2. Offender completed two sets of consent forms for vaccination.  It is unclear if he did not understand the process, or exactly why he would repeat the vaccination process.   a. Though language did not appear to be an issue, appropriate interpreters should be made available to obtain consents and provide education. b. When necessary consent forms should be provided in the native language spoken by the offender. c. It is unclear why there was no further attempt to confirm that Offender had previously received a vaccination that day, after stating that fact to those present before he received his second dose of vaccine. In the future, if an individual states that he or she has already been vaccinated the process must stop until his or her claims have been verified or shown to be false. 3. Any unplanned changes to the onsite vaccination plan (add-ons, extra dose redistribution, team deployment etc.) must be communicated to all members of the vaccination team.  4. Health care staff alone are responsible for the completion of all consent forms and vaccination documentation.   5. Identify best practices and standardize vaccination add-ons across facilities. Consider: location, addition to master vaccination roster, etc. a. Perhaps add-on vaccinations can be moved to another area for tracking. b. Add-ons should be added to the master vaccination roster.  Additional recommendations: 6. Re-Training on the vaccination protocol for health care, operations and national guard staff.

I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it's as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn't then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.

She was complaining of itching and has been watching the red spot get bigger every day. I instructed her to call you to have you look at her arm. She said it was just itching and she would like to try OTC products before going to the doctor.  I instructed her to take Benadryl 25mg up to four times per day.  Because Benadryl will make her tired, she can only take it when she is at home and not driving.  I also gave her Hydrocortisone 1% ointment to use at least twice per day on her arm.

Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies.

She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient's lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list.

She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient's lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn't feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler.

She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus.

That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she's doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient's big concern was that she probably shouldn't get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don't know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor's office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can't get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend's house, the left foot & calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported ""normal"" reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint & ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping.

I woke up around 12:40 to use the bathroom. I noticed right away that I was having trouble sitting up. It was difficult to swing my legs to the floor. I tried to stand up but my legs would not support me. I tried several times. I woke my husband and told him I was unable to stand. He came over to my side to help me. But there was no possibility of my legs holding me up. I went on my knees and tried to pull myself up with my husband?s help and using the bed frame. My husband went to get our daughter to help and told me to crawl to the bathroom. By the time he and she got back (it was only a few minutes) I was able to sit on the toilet with his help. I could then stand up and with his help walked back to the bed. This hasn?t happened again. On Tuesday March 2nd I could walk ok but it felt like my left knee wanted to give out a couple of times. The last few nights I have had leg and foot cramps which isn?t normal for me. I texted my doctor to let him know these events.,,,,,,,,,U,02/28/2021,03/02/2021,2,None,PVT,,"Viibryd, Concerta,Busprirone, Atorvastatin, Metformin",None,Type 2 diabetes  Chemical Imbalance,,,2,03/05/2021,,Y,,Ibuprofen

About four hours after injection, extreme pain in left shoulder, rotator cuff, unable to move arm .  Had to take ibuprofen approximately every six hours for the next 24 hours.  Two days since the injection, the pain is about 20 percent less.  NOTE 1: The probable reason for the unusual pain was that the injection was given much too high on the arm, near the top of the shoulder. I went back to the pharmacy on March 6, 2021, spoke with senior pharmacist, and showed the injection location with the band-aid still on. He noted it was a ""bit high"" and who had administered the vaccine. He said he would look into the injection technique of the person who had administered the dose.  NOTE 2 - THIS IS THE REASON I SUBMIT THIS REPORT: While the situation is handled at the pharmacy in question, I believe that with the rush to get the vaccine into arms, the CDC may need to pay more attention to the experience level of those administering it, making sure they have the proper training and actually have learned the proper injection technique. The CDC's YouTube video I have seen on the injection technique is a bit long.  The segment beginning at the 2:40 minute point should be separated and labeled ""injection technique for adults"" and have it made clearer that the injection is at the CENTER of the deltoid, with the very top of the inverted triangle NOT being acceptable.  My understanding is that the pain level from injecting at the rotator cuff is unnecessary and can lead to SIRVA - ""Shoulder Injury from Vaccine."" Please take the necessary steps to ensure the vaccine is being properly administered at the correct place in the arm. Otherwise, too many people will be undergoing unnecessary,  extreme pain as I have .",,,,,,,,,U,03/04/2021,03/04/2021,0,None.,PHM,,"potassium, magnesium, multi-vitamin",None,None,,,2,03/06/2021,,,,None

I am notifying you of what happened in hopes that you will be able to increase my understanding of what took place and  the implications in regard to the efficacy of the vaccine I received. While getting the vaccine some of the content was dripping at my elbow. I caught the drip and then told the person giving me the shot that it was running down my arm. She said, ?it?s on your arm,? then wiped my arm with a piece of gauze. I did not see it, only felt it so I do not know how much ran down my arm rather than going in my arm. While sitting in the waiting area I realized how different that experience was from my first dose. The shot in general felt different (more like a stamp). I asked to speak with someone there with medical knowledge of what happed with my vaccine. I was connected with a woman (I don?t know her name or role at the site) who asked me questions then went to talk with the person who gave the shot. When she came back she told me something to the effect that this had happened a few times before and that it was a problem with the injector from the supplier having a separation allowing some of the vaccine to leak. She also said (this is where she lost me) there is a small amount of the vaccine at the end that is not really needed and that may have been the part that leaked out. She said that I should be covered by that part of the vaccine that I did receive and that she would have to fill out a report on what happened. When I returned home of course I wanted to read about faulty injectors and leaking vaccine during the trial studies and the conclusions drawn. I was not able to find anything so I contacted my primary care physician to tell her what had happened and to see what she knew. She also could not find any information on Moderna vaccines leaking in her resources and encouraged me to contact you.   My questions:  What percentage of the vaccine dose is actually not needed to achieve the desired coverage?  How does that equate to how much leaked during my shot? Do you or Moderna have a way of checking with a blood test to see if I have received an accurate or adequate vaccine dosage? Where can I get a copy of the report that was written?  Thank you in advance for your help.   Date:03/05/2021 Time: 10:43 Chair #7",,,,,,,,,,03/05/2021,03/05/2021,0,,UNK,,,,,,,2,03/06/2021,,,,

My entire left side from head to fingertips to toes ached at a level of 9 out of 10. My neck aches across both shoulders and my lower back aches across to my right side; the rest of my right side was unaffected. I took Tylenol every 6 hours which dimmed the pain to about a 6, but it would wear off 4.5 hours later, jumping back up to a 9. I eventually started taking Aleve later that evening to help at around 6 pm. I would become warm off and on, running a very low fever. I didn?t have any other symptoms other than the extreme pain, aches, and feeling drained. The next day (Friday) my pain had decreased to a 7.5-8, but my lymph node was still extremely painful and swollen. The pain continued to decrease the next day to a 5; Sunday was the last day of the left side body aches and lymph node swelling. However, the next morning (Monday) I woke to extreme lower back spasms/seizing. I went to the  clinic  at 1pm and was given a shot of Toridol and prescribed Voltaire?s and Flexiril.

Upon waking, I realized that it was blood that was from a fairly significant bloody nose that I was having.  Even though I used facial tissues to deal with the bleed, it took nearly 25 minutes or so to subside as it was quite severe.  The situation is/was HIGHLY unusual as I haven't had a bloody nose for at least a decade (or perhaps even 2 decades) and when I earlier did, I was usually able to deal with it and get it to stop within a minute or two.  In this case, the bleed was significant, flowing quite heavily, when standing straight up (with blood dripping out of my nose) and even when lying in a prone position, wouldn't stop for 25 minutes.

Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn't able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn't believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn't seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it's on record at the hospital that that's what happened the first time. It wasn't the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn't as good as last time, either. Apparently they've been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn't offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that's what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there's a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I'll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we'll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it's taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot.

That night I experienced mild fever and chills and woke up to several hot flashes and the bed soaked with sweat. I felt like this for 2 days. I took Tylenol for the headache and body ache and basically just slept.

I had a full hysterectomy and oophorectomy  in 2012 and for approximately 6 months afterwards I experienced hot flashes which were mild but became predictable to the point that I only had a hot flash if I drank Orange Juice, and only 1 hot flash-This has been this way since 2012 . Since I have had the vaccine, I am experiencing hot flashes a minimum of 5-10 times a day.  Very random and no longer predictable.  I get extremely sweaty to the point I have to fan myself. They are just like the first night after getting the 2nd dose as far as feeling like I have a fever and becoming drenched in sweat.
