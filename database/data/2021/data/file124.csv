It was like that for 5 days and when she came back from the hospital she was sent back to the hospital again with abdominal pain and rashes in the body and the belly, it was a little rash and She went to the family care doctor and a dermatologist that prescribed her antibiotics and nothing worked. They did a test in the skin and she was diagnosed with a skin disorder. She was given a creamand more antibiotics, nothing worked and the rash got worse. She was seen by around five different doctors. After the second biospy on her skin she was diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris, it's actually a blister rash from head to toe (in June started a little bit but then it got worse). She does not have bacteria on the skin that's why the antibiotics were not working. She took her to a specialist back at the end of July.

I had been alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen for the pain. Headache became so extreme on day 3 that I finally  took an oxycodone . Projectile vomiting,  explosive diarrhea.  Mild SOB. When confusion increased the next day my daughter took me to urgent care. All the symptoms of covid but NO FEVER!  My BP and pulse ox remained fairly normal until the headache became severe. Even when I was sweating profusely I never had a fever.  Then I?d get chilled.  Skin felt creepy like the flu makes you feel.  Negative for covid, negative for flu, negative for other viruses.

Then developed tingling of the left and since that time, she has had left lateral upper arm at area of injection, tingling (pins and needles) of the lateral upper arm and dorsal forearm and to all the fingers. ""Like they are asleep"". No weakness. No rash. Had some CP (pinch in the anterior lower chest) while sitting in her office today. Left leg has similar sensations of tingling from the knee down. No HA. No vision change. No better or worse than when it started.    She reports that she had a panic attack last Friday. This is also when the tingling sensation begin to happen in her left arm where she got the shot. She denies any previous symptoms similar to this. She notes that she did experience some joint pain after the COVID vaccination. She states that she cannot catch a full breath when taking a breath. She states that her energy is not coming back after receiving this vaccination. POSTIMMUNIZATION REACTION PARESTHESIAS ANXIETY Try steroid pack, Prednisone, to lower symptomatology from immune vaccine reaction. Will take 2 a day for 5 days. If this does not improve symptoms then refer to neurologist. We discussed that I have seen this a couple times with the covid vaccine and with the other cases, the symptoms resolved spontaneously with time though steroid helped a bit with lessening symptoms. I don't see any concerning symptoms for stroke, seizure, MS, etc. We discussed that aggressive evaluation would include MRI now but I believe we could watch and wait to see effects of treatment. However offered if she was uncomfortable with plan, then order MRI. She is open to trying steroid for initial course of action. Follow-up if symptoms do get worse or do not improve and do not take second dose of vaccination for the time being given initial reaction to vaccine #1. Patient presents today for numbness and tingling follow-up.        Had EMG/NCV - normal.        MRI - normal.

She gets associated brain fog with this. If she is sitting or laying, she does not have these symptoms. She perceives swelling of the UE/LE but she notes no true swelling except around the menses. Feels better if she is wearing compression stocking and sleeves. No CP, SOB, palpitations, cough. She notes that she has been trying to not eat as much salt, she usually eats candy, but has stopped. She does not drink soda either. She denies headaches or back pain. She states that she is getting enough protein in her diet.         She reports that she was taking Fluoxetine 20mg, but stopped taking it a couple of days after she started as she had SE. Restarted at lower 10mg dose and now taking that daily without SE.

Within an hour of my first dose, I started to develop a very intense and severe headache in my forehead that lasted for days. This was probably the worst headache I've ever had, incredibly distracting, very painful, was hard to get any work done or do anything while it lasted. It lasted for days and slowly subsided over several weeks. About 1-2 weeks after my first dose, I started to notice some cognitive changes in myself. I wasn't understanding a simple joke a friend said, when normally her humor is very easy and I have never had issues with her jokes in the past. Another friend I confused dates of plans, when normally I am very organized with my calendar and timing, but suddenly I was having a hard time keeping track of days of the week and dates. She noticed it as well. Over the next few weeks and months, it got worse. Suddenly I wasn't able to retain information I had just heard - for instance I was in class and a teacher would tell me something. I would hear her, understand what she said, repeat it to myself, and promptly forget a minute later. One occasion, I asked a question and the teacher reminded me she had just said that information (yet somehow I couldn't remember it). This has happened multiple times with my boyfriend as well - I ask him something, he responds, I forget his response immediately and I forget I even asked, so I ask my question again. He reminds me I just asked, at which point then I remember I asked, but I forget his reply. He has commented multiple times on my memory issues. My mother has also noted my memory issues and has commented on them. I forget conversations we have - for instance I was supposed to teach her how to tint her eyebrows. The conversation happened, and yet I totally forgot it happened. I asked her a week later if she wanted me to teach her how to tint her brows and she paused and then reminded me that I already had. This is extremely unlike me. I am known in my family and friends for having an excellent memory. My earliest memories date back to when I was 17 months old, and yet suddenly I had this awful headache after my first vaccine dose and now I have trouble remembering something I heard 3 minutes prior. I can't retain information. This has affected my work, my earning ability (I had the worst quarter I've ever had this last quarter), my schooling (I forget what I learn). I have also messed up the order of words and numbers. For instance, I will invert an idiom unintentionally, so instead of writing ""stone cold,"" I'll write ""cold stone"" and not realize it until later when I re-read an email I sent. I will sometimes add verb endings to nouns by accident - for instance if I am trying to say I was reading a book, I might say ""read a booking."" I won't notice until later when I re-read what I wrote. This is a problem because these emails are going out to clients! I have also inverted numbers in sales quotes, a huge problem considering that I work in sales and what I quote and sell is my livelihood. Luckily I have caught myself most times, but there have been times I have inverted something that was supposed to be in the tens into the hundreds place and vice versa and that impacts my quotes! I reported all of this to my doctor in August, they had a virtual appointment with me in September, and then referred me to the cognitive neurology department. I have recently gone through cognitive testing, and I am waiting for the results in two weeks.",,,,,,,,,N,04/19/2021,05/01/2021,12,Cognitive testing - 9/28/2021 MRI I believe has been requested but has not taken place yet.,OTH,,"vitamin D3, vitamin B complex",none,none,,,2,10/11/2021,,Y,,none

This assay has not been evaluated for this purpose in hospital inpatients, postoperative patients, or other patient types than those indicated.  Elevated D-Dimers may be seen in activation states of coagulation.  Elevated states of D-Dimer levels may be associated with the following:  DVT, DIC, hemorrhages, fibrinolysis, post-operative periods, cancer, and severe infections.  D-Dimer levels may be falsely elevated in underlying, non-thrombotic conditions common in hospitalized patients.  Cut-off value for D-dimer use in evaluation of VTE is 500 ng/mL FEU.  The measurement of D-Dimer should not be used as an aid in the diagnosis of VTE in patients with:    -        Therapeutic dose anticoagulant therapy for >24 hours  -        Fibrinolytic therapy within previous 7 days  -        Trauma or surgery within previous 4 weeks  -        Aortic aneurysm  -        Sepsis, severe infections, pneumonia, severe skin infections  -        Liver cirrhosis  -        Renal Failure  -        Pregnancy    Physicians recommend that in patients older than 50 years with low-to-intermediate pretest probability for acute pulmonary embolism, an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff of age x 10 (FEU units) can be used to exclude a diagnosis of PE without need for further imaging.

Per ED Note: History of Present Illness   Patient is a 74-year-old female with past medical history of bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypothyroidism presenting to the emergency department with chief complaint of cough and shortness of breath.  Patient states that she has been experiencing cough, dizziness and difficulty breathing for approximately 1 week.  She went to her PCP and was prescribed cough medicine with codeine and an unknown antibiotic but has not experienced any significant relief of her symptoms.  She states that the shortness of breath is worse with exertion and alleviated by rest.  She states that the cough is productive of clear sputum.  Patient states that she is received both of her COVID-19 vaccines and denies any known sick contacts.  Patient denies headache, blurry vision, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, abdominal pain, numbness, weakness or tingling her extremities. ED Course/Medical Decision Making:     The evaluation, management, services and procedures as well as the key components of the patient's care described here in were performed in the presence of the attending physician.  Old E-care/clinical records were reviewed.   Pulse oximetry interpreted by me: 89 % room air - normal    Initial vital signs are stable.    ED Course/Reevaluation:   Labs -COVID-19 rapid test is positive. Creatinine 1.3 mg/dL.   Imaging -  Bilateral peripheral predominant airspace disease suspicious for viral pneumonia.  Congestive heart failure changes with diffuse interstitial edema.   EKG -ventricular rate 91 bpm, PR interval 170, QRS 74, QT/QTc 340/418, normal sinus rhythm.   ED Course -patient presents with complaint of shortness of breath for 1 week.  Physical exam significant for a tired appearing patient, clear lungs bilaterally, otherwise unremarkable. Upon arrival patient was hypoxic at 89% and required supplemental oxygen to bring her SPO2 to 93%.  Patient also received an albuterol/Atrovent breathing treatment with some improvement in her shortness of breath.  Basic labs obtained are significant for positive COVID-19 rapid test, acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.3 mg/dL).  CXR demonstrates bilateral peripheral predominant airspace disease suspicious for viral pneumonia and congestive heart failure changes with diffuse interstitial edema.  EKG is normal.  Patient was treated with Lasix 10 mg.  This patient symptoms are most likely related to COVID-19.  I recommended to the patient that she be admitted for her acute hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen and she agrees.  I contacted this patient's PCP and the on-call physician, and she accepted the admission with request that the patient be evaluated by infectious disease as an inpatient.

I was able to reach the doctor on-call at my primary care practice that Saturday night (telemed). I sent him a picture - he said it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine ( a delayed skin reaction). He told me to take Benadryl and to go to ER if I had trouble breathing. I didn't have to go to ER as I didn't have trouble breathing. The Benadryl helped with the itching. The rash stayed there close to a week. The Benadryl did improve it and I took it for another 24 hours. On the 22nd, I went to Urgent Care  (the same phone number as my doctor) and the rash was real still really visible. They prescribed a topical ointment (steroid) and that was helpful. It was still itchy but not as bad as before I used that - it was more like a normal mosquito bite after using it. Dr. at Urgent Care said it was definitely an allergic reaction. He also prescribed an oral steroid which  I didn't take.

I went to my Primary Care Dr, and she also prescribed me the same topical steroid which I used. It took about a week for that rash to resolve.

I felt no reaction from either shot except for mild arm soreness where the vaccine was given. This soreness disappeared within a day or two.  About a week after receiving my second shot of Moderna, I started having mild chest pains. I did not relate these pains to a Covid shot. On the evening of March 31, 2021, I was feeling tired and told my wife I would take a bath and go to bed, which I did. I couldn't get comfortable in bed as my chest was hurting, so I got up and sat to watch TV for a while. While sitting up, the chest pain went away. I went back to bed, and the chest pain intensified anI went back to bed, and the chest pain intensified and was radiating down my left arm. I got up and told my wife I thought I was having a heart attack. She immediately drove me to the hospital, where I was admitted to the Emergency Room and given a battery of tests. At 5:00 AM, I was admitted to the hospital overnight for more testing. On April 1, the diagnosis was pericarditis. The hospital doctor prescribed Colchicine which I took daily. On April 25 I sent a message to my Dr., my Cardiologist: I wanted to update you on the status of my symptoms. I have been taking an antibiotic ( Doxycycline Hyclate 100 MG) for the past three weeks. Today I ran out of the prescription. It doesn't seem to matter as I have continuously hacked up sputum all day for the past three weeks. The anti biotic doesn't seem to be doing any good. Also my pericarditis used to be causing me pain only when I lay on my back in bed. For the past week, it is causing me pain in my chest and shoulder when I stand or sit. It is not severe pain, but it is there. It appears to be getting worse. I have run out of my Ibuprofen prescription and have been taking Advil (three 200 MG pills). I had an appointment with Dr. (Rheumatologist) on 4/27 and she seemed to believe that my heart issue was associated with my upper chest condition. I have an appointment with Dr. (Pulmonary) on May 4. Medication doesn't seem to be helping. Any suggestions?  I just want to confirm with you that you are taking the Colchicine daily as well? Thank you, RN.  Yes, I am taking the Colchicine daily, but as I indicated, my chest pain seems to be getting worse, not better. My chest pain is there even if I am not lying down. It is not severe, but it is there when I breathe.  On May 4, 2021, I visited Dr., a Pulmonologist, for coughing up yellow sputum. He prescribed a PredniSONE taper and scheduled a complete pulmonary function test in late June.  On July 8, I visited Dr., and he stopped the prescription for Colchicine as he believed the pericarditis was resolved. Also, on July 8, I saw Dr., Pulmonologist, and he believed my upper chest infection had been resolved, but scheduled a full pulmonory test on my lungs which was done on July 28. It showed my lungs were clear and breathing normally. ""This test showed no obstructive or restrictive ventilatory defect. Overall, lung volumes are normal.

Upon initial evaluation she is hypoxic to 86%.  Placed on 2 L nasal cannula with good response.  COVID-19 testing is positive.  She has an AKI evident on CMP.  Lactic acid slightly elevated 2.2.  She is given 2 L IV fluids for her AKI and lactic acidosis.  She does not have a history of decreased EF.  Chest x-ray is consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.  She is given 6 mg IV Decadron.  I spoke with the hospitalist who agrees to admission and further management of this patient. Assessment/Plan  DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition: 1. Pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus  2. Hypoxia  3. Respiratory insufficiency  4. AKI (acute kidney injury)  5. Lactic acidosis  10/3/2021 note:  ASSESSMENT / PLAN: Pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus Assessment & Plan Continue remdesivir, inhaled steroid, inhaled beta stimulant, inhaled Spiriva, supplemental oxygen, empirical antibiotic coverage as well given the presence of elevated procalcitonin. She received dexamethasone on hospital day 1 when she was still in ER and then she became confused and agitated, she threatened to leave AMA on hospital day 2 at 7a.m., she was agitated.  She did calm down subsequently and I have found out that she does tolerate small amounts of inhaled steroids but not oral steroids.  Therefore I switched to the available in the hospital equivalent of  Trelegy she takes as an outpatient specifically Dulera and Spiriva  plus p.r.n. albuterol. Vitamin C, zinc are also being given. DVT prophylaxis Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia  Assessment & Plan Continue high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, she is saturating 93 up to 95% on 60 L, plus non-rebreather, FiO2 is 100%.  If she worsens then next step would be intubation 10/8/2021 note: Assessment/Plan: Pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus Assessment & Plan Will continue with present medical regimen.  Will give a dose of Lasix today 10/05/2021 will give dose of Lasix today.  Also talked her about the steroid issue.  She wants to try it again.  I thought I had given to her orally my diet have the same subjective feelings that she has been getting with the IV steroids 10/06/2021 her D-dimers markedly elevated at 11,000 thousand.  I have empirically started her on heparin drip.  Will send her down for a CT angiogram.  Will also schedule her for upper lower extremity Dopplers.  Clinically she says she feels better today than she did yesterday. 10/07/2021 initially she had an elevated procalcitonin question of an infiltrate.  Procalcitonin has normalized but there is consolidation at the mention on her CT scan.  I decided to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for now.  In light of her declining respiratory status will move her to the intensive care unit 10/08/2021 she finished remdesivir, she is refusing the empirical antibiotic coverage.  Will check a procalcitonin in the morning.  She is on the inhaled steroid but she refused the intravenous Solu-Medrol. 10/08/2021 the patient stated to me and also she stated in no uncertain terms to the previous physician that she does not desire intubation in case that she deteriorates to that point.  I do intend to honor this and she is therefore a do not resuscitate.  However it should be noted that she is now maxed out on nasal cannula high-flow oxygen plus non-rebreather and she is saturating marginally in the low 90s at best.  I made her daughter aware of these and I also discussed extensively with the daughter when the that the prognosis is guarded in this patient with COVID pneumonia and pre-existing severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Note from 10/11/2021: 10/09/2021 the patient is saturating marginally on 60 L of oxygen per nasal cannula plus non-rebreather however now she is pleasant and cooperative with the medication therefore this is a bit plus compared to yesterday 10/10/2021 the patient is doing a bit better oxygen saturation wise on the same supplemental oxygen she was on yesterday.  She is conversational and speaks in longer sentences before being short of breath.  She refused the Lovenox therapeutic but she is okay with the heparin drip.  Afebrile. 10/11/2021 I consulted virtual intensive care unit, I appreciated very much their input, the patient is not a candidate for intubation given her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease history.

Normally by day 4 my bleeding would get very light almost spotty in nature rather than a constant bleeding. By day 9 it was extremely heavy with a serious amount of large, golf ball size clots. Bleeding was so heavy and has been since receiving the vaccine that when going to the bathroom it sounds like I am voiding rather than changing a tampon. The super plus tampons and a heavy pad are saturated in less than 2 hours and to date it has just got to the point that a super plus tampon will last 2 hours and will be leaking before that 2 hours is up. My normal menstrual cycle lasts a max of 5 to 6 days with the last two days being spotty not even a light consistent flow.  I have had a severe headache for 2 weeks now and nothing is helping it at all. Have been to the GYN and my PCP and nothing else is wrong that could be causing this so I was instructed to file this because it is an adverse reaction. I am also a Nurse and will be forced to take the 2nd injection in 8 days and with the wax the bleeding is still going, I will more than likely still be bleeding when I get the 2nd injection.

This happened within 20 minutes. I also got vertigo within 20 minutes as well. After that, it felt like I was on a boat. If I turned my head too fast things moved too quickly. I felt off balanced as if I was in a boat. I felt tired and sick as well. After the vaccine I also got severe headaches and head pressure. I also experienced tinnitus and my ears felt as if they were spasming inside. This has gotten better over a few months and went away. I do still get headaches more often. The vertigo waned over a few months and is now basically gone. The first night after the 1st dose, I also had a pounding heart palpitation which I usually get when I am really sick. For my second shot, within 24 hours, I had sore arm, nausea, fatigue etc which all went away in a few days.  I saw an NP for the vertigo who told me to take Ativan which helped significantly. I then found out that you need to stop taking the Ativan in order for your brain to cure the vertigo. So, I stopped taking the Ativan and within 3 days, it had improved and eventually went away. I am supposed to go for a full vestibular testing (4hrs) but I feel I am okay for now so I have put it off. Based on his full evaluation, he suggested I have vestibular neuritis.

1779165,10/12/2021,CA,50.0,50,,F,,"April 11, in the morning (8am) I woke up with a heavy feeling in my chest. Pain in my right arm, I also had flu like symptoms. My head hurt and I was coughing. My whole body was aches and pains. I was cold and hot, and I was in bed for a week. On the 14th, I went to the ER . They did a lot of tests ? ECG, (high), BP 160//100, a chest xray which was normal, a lot of blood tests and nothing came abnormal, troponin was .04. everything came back normal and the only thing that was abnormal was my blood pressure. The doctor said they didn?t find everything and said to follow up with primary doctor. I didn?t think anything of it at the time so I went back to my normal routine. I noticed that I was out of breath a lot, so I figured it was maybe old age. As I progressed more and more, every time I walk up a flight of stairs, I?m tired. This is where I got worried. I work out 5-6 times a week with pilates and hikes with my girlfriends with no issues. And now I?m no longer able to do that. That was my main concern. On 9/23/2021, I wasn?t feeling well so I reached out to my doctor, I called & texted him and he wanted to do a video chat. He asked me if I had a BP machine, so I took my BP and took it and showed it to him ? 161/102. He said you needed to go the ER but I didn?t want to go. The last time I went, there was nothing found. He said the BP scared him and I went to the ER on 9/23. On that day I went to the ER and its packed. They said it would be a long wait, but that was fine. They took my vitals and they said my BP was way too high. I sat at the ER for 3 hours. They finally called me to the back & checked an ECG and there were abnormality. They took my oxygen and said my heart wasn?t getting enough oxygen. They ran a stress test on my heart and took a lot of blood for tests. Some came back with some info, but the bottom line was they couldn?t tell me why my blood pressure was so high and why my heart wasn?t getting enough oxygen because it was strong. I talked to my doctor to see what else he could do. I was in the ER for about 2 days, they didn?t admit me but they held me there for 2 days. They were overwhelmed with patients. I followed up w my doctor on 9/29 . We did another virtual doctor visit and he ordered an inhaler for me called Albuterol 90. He told me to use the inhaler when I needed it the most. He also ordered me to follow up with a pulmonologist and I have an appointment with them on 11/11 at 1pm . I still can?t catch my breath, even when I?m talking. I?m trying to go back to working out and I can only do 1 hour a day because that?s all I can handle. A constant pressure in my chest, I can?t catch my breath.

I felt a flushing sensation, my heart was racing, nauseous, dizzy, and my blood pressure was high at the time, but I didn't know it. I had to lay down.  I felt terrible for several hours. I just laid in bed, I didn't know what was going on. Then I felt better the next day. I had a couple of these events off and on with same symptoms. I didn't check my blood pressure so at the time I didn't now it was high. May 10th I saw my doctor. I was also having pain in my gut. She did bloodwork and said to go to gastroenterologist. She increased the dosage of my blood pressure medication. I seen the  gastroenterologist and she performed an upper GI and a colonoscopy but didn't find anything. June 9th I went back to my doctor because I was continuing to have the same attacks. My blood pressure was 170/110. I have never had anything like this before previously before having the COVID vaccine. I got a really bad attack at work on June 17th. I work with senior citizens and help take care of them. I felt fine in the morning and then by 1:00pm when I was going to bathroom I was dizzy, vision was swimming, and I thought I was going to pass out. I looked at my heart rate and it was 130 BPM. I still didn't know that my blood pressure was high at that time. I laid down, and I didn't feel good at all. I tried to rest and stay calm. At that point I had to call my company and send someone to come in for me so they could release me. I felt my heart rate racing  and fluttering. I went to urgent care and my blood pressure was 190/ 117. They kept me there for about 3 or 4 hours. By then my blood pressure came down, and my symptoms kind of subsided. They wanted me to go over to the hospital, but I didn't want to. So did they did an EKG that showed my heart rate and blood work was okay. They released me, and then I went home. June 22nd I called my doctor. Before April 12 the last time I saw my doctor was December 2020 but since getting the vaccine I have been to the doctor so many times and taking so many different test. June 29th I talked to my doctor about my symptoms and she increased my blood pressure medication again. July 8th I had to leave work again. This time it was late at night. I had gotten a blood pressure monitor and it was getting high even while taking my blood pressure medication that was adjusted to a higher dosage. I went into ER again and they kept me overnight because of heart racing and blood pressure was so high. I asked them to check my adrenal glands. And I found out that I have an issue with my adrenal glands. They diagnosed me with hyperaldosteronism. My endocrinologist said that that diagnosis shouldn't cause the symptoms that I have been having except for my potassium being low and having a racing heart.  The doctors still don't know why I am still having these attacks if my potassium isn't low. I had to go to ER again in October 2021 because of an attack I had in September 28th at work. I had the same symptoms. My blood pressure was 180/110. My doctor boosted blood pressure medication again to an even higher dosage. I started a new medication for hyperaldosteronism which is spironolactone 50mg, 2xday.  September 29 I got another attack and went to the emergency room. Since then I have still had some attacks. I have missed 10 working days from all of this over the course after getting vaccine. I have a couple more appointments coming up. Symptom causes are still unknown. I am going to see a more experienced endocrinologist next month. I have almost passed out twice. I have felt horrible ever since getting the vaccine. I really didn't want to get the vaccine, but due to my previous health and my job I decided to take it. July 8th i was hospitalized. I have been to my doctor 6 times since April 2021.

I could not get an appointment with any doctors.  I  had a phone visit with my kidney doctor, and said my kidneys were good but my BP was very high.

1780148,10/12/2021,MA,17.0,17,,M,,"My son (a very fit athlete.  He is 6 feet tall, about 162 pounds and has a 29 inch waist- a healthly kid with a 21-22 BMI) developed high blood pressure and bad headaches/migraines pretty suddenly in April, which we saw for the first time within a couple of weeks of  his first COVID vaccine.  He is 17.  He had a physical the month prior to this and had no issues (His blood pressure was 120/76 on 3/11/21).  We have 2 older daughters who were vaccinated with no adverse reactions except the usual post vaccine fatigue.   My son?s school was concerned about  his blood pressure starting on April 27and made him do an EKG to be safe and it was normal, so we chalked it up to school stress and forgot about it.  Throughout the summer, his headaches got worse and more frequent.  We hadn't given his blood pressure another thought since school was out.  He then got a COVID breakthrough infection mid July (but this was all happening and worsening before that).  His case was very mild and no one else in our household got the infection (4 of us) from him.  Before school started, I took him to his pediatrician to discuss the headaches, which went from 2 days a week to 3-4 days a week some weeks.  To my surprise, his blood pressure was still high (160/90).  He also had sugar in his urine and his glucose was 136 (he hadn?t eaten in hours, but it was not a true fasting test).  We repeated that test days later and no glucose in urine and his fasting glucose was 100).  We repeated a third time (fasting) and no sugar in urine and glucose was 93.  We were sent to a cardiologist for the blood pressure.  She first did a blood pressure study to confirm that the blood pressure was in fact high and not due to white coat syndrome. So ordered an echocardiogram and a renal ultrasound.  Both were normal (as were kidney lab values).    Meanwhile, his headaches continue to worsen and are migraine level about 5-6 days a week now and he can?t sleep and it?s interfering with school and sports.  I have had to work with his school on several occasions because he would get 3-4 hours of sleep for 4 days in a row and could barely function.  We saw a neurologist and she did a brain MRI and it was normal.  The only finding was ?subcentimeter reactive cervical Lymph nodes?, which they said could be due to something as minor as a cold.  We have a consult with an endocrinologist later this month.  And may schedule one with a rheumatologist.  The neurologist just ordered an MRI of the blood vessels.  We may start him on beta blockers to try to lower the blood pressure which has now consistently been 155/100 or more every day with or without the migraine.  I should mention he had no history of headaches or migraines or high blood pressure prior to late April.  As I mentioned earlier in the note, almost exactly a month before the first vaccine, his blood pressure was 120/76.    The cardiologist said sometimes this happens with no explanation.  But, as I said, he is a super fit, active, healthy 17 year old boy.  And I can?t believe this ?just happens?, especially so suddenly.  When we tried to unravel this, we realized it started soon after the first Pfizer vaccine.  I can?t find any information on this and no one can figure out what is going on.  We have now consulted with 4 doctors (three are specialists), in addition to the emergency room once where we saw 2 ER doctors plus a neurologist.  And we don?t have any hint of an answer.  We live outside of the state and most of the specialists have been out of Hospital.  We don?t even know if the blood pressure and migraines are related.  And we don?t know if the vaccine is related.  But it is certainly a strong coincidence at the least.    My son (who is at boarding school) was sending me blood pressure readings last night of 155/104.  We are getting very very worried.  We don't have any idea where to turn for answers at this point. We are hesitant to only treat/mask symptoms without finding the cause of this, as it was so sudden.  The neurologist won't give him abortive migraine medicine because they tend to raise blood pressure and, since we haven't seen a nephrologist, she is hesitant. Any direction or info you can give me would be very much appreciated. We are a very much pro-vaccine family,  but we can?t ignore this coincidence and are worried that it could have triggered an underlying condition that we can?t find.",,,,,,,,,N,04/14/2021,04/27/2021,13,Normal Brain MRI NORMAL EKG NORMAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM NORMAL RENAL ULTRASOUND,OTH,,"Strattera, Focalin",none,none,,,2,10/12/2021,,Y,Y,Doxycycline

One to two minutes after receiving the shot, the client communicated to RN. she was feeling lightheaded and had a syncopal episode which lasted 2-3 seconds.  RN happened to walk into the vaccination room at the same time the incident occurred and called out to Lead RN to retrieve an EMT.  While the episode was occurring, RN. held up the client in her chair, and the client began to respond.  Lead RN, went to the observation room to obtain EMT.  He and Lead RN  proceeded to vaccination station 2.  Upon arriving, Lead RN observed that with the assistance of RN, the client was still seated upright in the chair, diaphoretic, and pale in color.  RN was speaking with the client asking how she felt, when the client experienced a 2nd syncopal event that lasted 1-2 seconds.  RN performed a sternal rub, and the client was responsive.  EMT was also with the client asking her name and if she knew where she was, and the client was able to adequately respond.  At 16:25 EMT applied a pulse oximeter on the client?s finger and let it reside there.

EMT also gave the client an ice pack to apply to her forehead and back of her neck, which she utilized.  Client stated she was hot and exhibited mild shakiness.  Client was given a bottle of water, and crackers, which she ate/drank.  Client stated she had a small snack before coming to get vaccinated, but had not had a full meal since 11:00.  Client and her mother stated the client does not have any underlying conditions, no allergies, and takes no medications.  Client stated she was a little anxious and hesitant about getting the vaccine.  She was only getting it because it is mandated.  Client stated she was starting to feel better.  Client also stated she did not really remember having the syncopal episodes.  She just remembered she was feeling lightheaded and then started to notice her range of vision narrowing.  At 16:39 EMT took the client?s vitals (BP: 131/76, HR: 73, SPO2: 99%).  Client was also given an orange soda, which she drank.  Lead RN observed the color had come back to the client?s face and she was no longer diaphoretic.  Client stated she was feeling a lot better and was ready to try standing up. Lead RN educated the client and her mother on both the potential side effects and adverse effects of the vaccine, when to seek medical attention, and ER precautions.  Lead RN  requested the client and her mother go to the observation room with EMT to be observed for an additional 15 minutes and they agreed.  At 14:55, EMT took the clients vitals (BP: 122/80, HR: 61, SPO2: 99%.  Client stated she felt fine.

I had been in menopause and my last period before September 30 ,2021, occurred in November 2019.  I had a full period for a week and this was not vaginal bleeding.   A week before I had the period, my breasts became full and tender...so much so that I was googling ""breast pain, breast soreness, post menopausal"".  This tells me that what I experienced was hormonal in nature and not just bleeding. This wasn't spotting either...it was as if something in my body that controlled ovulation clicked back on.  The period lasted one week and was exactly like my former regular periods.  I fully believe that the Pfizer vaccine ""kicked"" me out of menopause and I have many questions.  Am I fertile again? Could I get pregnant? Am I producing estrogen again (hence the sore breasts before the period)? Will I go through menopause again? Will I experience hot flashes, crashing estrogen levels? How could I have a period if my estrogen levels were low?  It seems to me that there had to be significant estrogen production to create sore breasts.

Patient  has significant medical comorbidities chronic pouchitis on rotating flagyl and cipro 2/2 total proctocolectomy w/ ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (2014) d/t ulcerative colitis, PSC s/p liver transplant (11/2017), pyoderma gangrenosum, and CKD III (baseline creatinine unclear, but has ranged from 1.4-2.3 in the last year).    Per chart review, patient has been in town for her four year posttransplant follow-up appointments.  She underwent a pouchoscopy for for surveillance on 10/06/2021 that was uncomplicated.  She then contacted the on-call liver transplant pager around 2300 on 10/07/2021 with complaints of chills, shakes, nausea without vomiting, decreased oral intake, and increased bowel output.   On arrival to the ED patient was hemodynamically stable and in no acute distress.  She was found to have an SpO2 of 89% and was placed on 2 L supplemental oxygen via NC with subsequent improvement.  Laboratory studies were obtained.  CBC revealed WBC 16.9 with neutrophils 13.82.  CMP was notable for a bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 31, creatinine of 2.38, and a total calcium of 10.5.  Lipase was 46.  Lactate was 1.2.  Urinalysis was notable for trace ketones, trace blood, and 30 protein.  COVID testing was positive.  Recent imaging including CXR and liver ultrasound were unremarkable/stable from previous examinations.  Pouchoscopy on 10/06/2021 revealed anal canal stenosis and a single erosion in the neoterminal ileum with known inflammation and the ileoanal pouch 2/2 pouchitis.  Patient was given 1 L NS in the ED and is being admitted  for ongoing evaluation and management.   On arrival to the  medical floor patient was hemodynamically stable. Regarding her current COVID infection, patient was vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer series on 03/19/2021 and 04/13/2021.  She states that she had not attended any large social gatherings or public events in the last several weeks.  She noted that she consistently wears a mask when out in public.  However, patient noted that her daughter and son-in-law do not ""believe in COVID"" and so they are not vaccinated and do not take safety precautions while in public. Patient visited with her daughter and son-in-law on 09/29/2021 who were feeling ill with symptoms of headache and upper respiratory congestion at the time of their visit.  Patient then began to feel fatigued, weak and noted muscle aches on 10/02/2021.  Given her transplant status, Infectious Diseases was consulted and recommended remdesivir, and dexamethasone if indicated.  Respiratory status, inflammatory markers and labs were monitored closely.  Collateral workup was obtained and excluded other acute COVID-related complications.  Fortunately, her respiratory status improved.  Weaning from O2 was successful.  Home oxygen evaluation was performed by RT on 10/11.  She was found to NOT quality for homegoing oxygen therapy.    Overall, her hospital course was uncomplicated. Medical staff was consulted to assist with her immunosuppression medications.  Her Tacrolimus trough was elevated at 9.2.  Her Tacrolimus dose was decreased and a repeat trough is trending.  Of note, her urine cultures were checked due to a high WBC.  They came back positive but because she was asymptomatic, no antibiotics were administered.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay on the medical unit.  She completed a 5 day course of Remdesivir.  She demonstrated progressive improvement on the aforementioned therapies.

HOSPITAL COURSE: A 75-year-old male, primary care patient of Dr., presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath.  He actually states he was feeling fine and did not want to come to the ER, but his son insisted and dropped him off.  In the ER, he was COVID positive with infiltrates on x-ray and was 89% saturating on room air.  He was therefore admitted, was started on supplemental oxygen.  He was not given any specific treatments and monitored and did not have any worsening of his oxygenation.  He was saturating 93% to 94% on room air at the time of discharge.  With ambulation his oxygen saturation went down to 84% and so he did qualify for home oxygen temporarily.  It is felt to be stable for discharge home on this.  Dexamethasone was withheld due to non-severe disease and his already profound hyperglycemia from diabetes.

Past medical history if significant for atrial fibrillation on Xarelto, OSA on CPAP, and diabetes (on metformin).    On 10/4/2021 he developed COVID-19 infection and presented to the ED for evaluation of shortness of breath and weakness.   He was admitted to the medical floor and given supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone.  Around midnight on 10/10/2021 he became unresponsive and bradycardic with heart rates in the 30s with oxygen desaturation. He was initially placed on BiPAP but required intubation shortly thereafter.   CT/CTA chest was obtained after intubation, negative for acute PE but did show findings consistent with Covid-19 pneumonia.  Around 0200 a head CT was obtained which showed an acute left cerebellar infarct with effacement of the 4th ventricle and hydrocephalus with dilated 3rd ventricle and lateral ventricles.   He was transferred to another hospital on 10/10/2021. Recommended starting barcitinib (JAK inhibitor) for COVID pneumonia. He was started on Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. for D-dimer greater than 3000.  Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT. Neurology was consulted who recommended a repeat head CT with CTA 12 hours from the initial. CT/CTA at 1500 showed bilateral inferior cerebellar infarcts with an occluded left vertebral artery and left PICA.  There is progressive edema with worse effacement of the 4th ventricle and the prepontine cistern. Given worsening mass effect and brain compression he was transferred to another hospital for management.   His initial neurological exam was poor, although confounded by sedative medications. He was started on mannitol with improvement early in the day on 10/11/2021. Neurosurgery was consulted and evaluated. They discussed neurosurgical options with his family, who conveyed that surgical options would not reverse injury already sustained and therefore not be consistent with his wishes. His neurological exam worsened overnight on 10/11/2021 where he was not following commands in the left hemibody. Despite hydration and careful monitoring he developed acute kidney injury.    Family including wife and three sons were updated via telephone regarding the severity of his strokes. After discussion they agreed that he would not want to live with neurological disability and losing any part of his independence would not be consistent with his wishes. He also had a living will stating that he would not want artifical means prolonging his life if recovery consistent with his wishes was not able to be achieved. Therefore, he was transitioned to comfort care measures after discussion with patients family on 10/12/2021. He passed away peacefully with family at the bedside at 4:44 pm.",Y,10/12/2021,,,Y,1,,,N,02/06/2021,10/10/2021,246,"10/11/2021 Influenza A/B, SARS CoV-2, PCR, Rapid, Varies-  Sars CoV-2 PCR, Rapid DETECTED",UNK,,,,Nervous Stroke  Compression Of Brain  Hydrocephalus    Respiratory Respiratory Failure   Genitourinary Failure Renal Acute (Acute Kidney Injury)    Infectious/Inflammatory COVID-19 Infection,,,2,10/13/2021,,,,NKA

I was unable to schedule a face-to-face appointment with my doctor, so I had a telehealth visit with her. By then, I was still having numbness in my face, intermittent hearing loss, and muscle pain in the back of my legs. She referred me to a neurologist and a ENT specialist, who hasn't been able to see me yet. Dr. performed a CTV which came back clear, but I still had the numbness in my face. He said the vaccine caused inflammation of my brain that was causing the face numbness and scheduled me for a MRI on October 20. The pain in the back of my legs is so severe that I can barely walk.",,,,,,,,,N,09/17/2021,09/18/2021,1,"CBC panel, CT Scan, CTV, MRI scheduled  on October 20, 2021",PVT,,None,None,Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome; Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia (POTS),,vsafe,2,10/13/2021,,Y,Y,Xanax; Celexa; iron infusions

The patient states he has been feeling poorly for some time, cannot remember exactly how long. Has had increased sob and has had increased confusion. He was here on 10/2 in the ER with similar complaints. At that time, it was deduced that he had not been taking his medications as prescribed. He was given 80 mg of IV lasix and felt improved, so was sent home. It is of note that he was afebrile at that time (actually mildly hypothermic), and was on room air, and a covid swab at that time was negative. Today he comes in febrile to  101.2, still on room air. CXR shows some cardiomegaly with chf pattern vs possible atypical pneumonia. CXR on 10/2 just showed cardiomegaly. In the ER, the patient was started on sepsis IVF, receiving almost 5L. Covid swab then came back positive and his fluids were immediately stopped, and he has been given 80 mg of IV lasix. He currently is wheezing audibly, and states that he has been doing so at home as well. He does have a history of asthma. He is currently on room air. He does endorse diarrhea and lack of appetite with nausea, but he denies any emesis. He lives at Assisted Living and his wife lives with him.

The intensity of the pain was proportional to the intensity of the physical strain., and would typically start with discomfort in the arms, then upper back-pain and finally shoulder and neck pain.   The symptoms would disappear spontaneously after a brief rest (less than 3 min), but return quickly after restarting intense physical activity.  The symptoms were similar to angina, however I did NOT experience chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath or ""racing"" heart.  I did not experience any of these symptoms during rest time or light physical activity (for example walking).  Eventually, the symptoms gradually disappeared after several weeks (6 to 8), and currently I no longer experience them.

Upon completion of the vaccination, pharmacist had noticed we did not have the insurance information for the patient to process the claim.  The patient?s mother called the pharmacy and provided the insurance information.  After attempting to process the vaccination through the insurance, the patient?s insurance rejected the claim due to the patient?s age.  Pharmacist then brought this to my attention. My course of action is to fill out a VAERS report.  Additionally, I have contacted the manufacturer of J&J (Janssen) and have contacted the patient?s mother to make her aware.  I explained to her that a miscalculation was made with patient's age and she received the J&J vaccine, but it is not currently approved through EUA for her age?therefore, there is no concrete safety & efficacy data.  The patient?s mother kept repeating ?we are good here? and reported no current adverse effects.  I recommended for the patient to contact her primary care doctor to make them aware and to seek recommendation for further course of action as far as being evaluated for any potential adverse effects.  I have attempted to contact the physician?s office personally to make them aware of the vaccination error and am currently waiting on a return phone call after having to leave a voicemail.  I am following up on Friday with the patient?s mother & will also next week.

There was many more heightened symptoms as usual, back pain swelling. As soon as it started, it just kept going. I usually have a 6 day period and it went on for 6 weeks. I sought medical care after I ended up getting a stomach bug and so I was at the doctor for that. And I told them at that point I had my period with a month. And so they prescribed with progesterone. And it was a 10 day course of progesterone. So it's June 28th, I did 10 days of progesterone, and then my period started again after 3 days. It would continue by then. The end of May now through the end of June. So my doctor referred me to a gyno for a consultation at that point. And so I scheduled with her and saw her in the beginning of July and I had a July 28 ultrasound. They didn't understand why I was still experiencing a period at that point. There was a thickening of the lining but it was considered normal. They prescribed me to go on progesterone for 3 months to reset my cycle. I took it for a week but it made me so tired that I was unable to function. I couldn't work, I needed to take naps in the middle of the day. So I called my doctor and said I needed to stop the progesterone and the doctor that looked at my ultrasound said I could come in and surgically implant an IUD to stop taking oral medication to be sleepy, and I declined. Now I'm 5 months out and I use a tracking app for my periods, I'm currently at 41 day cycle with a 12 day period. It has been getting better.

A transvenous pacer was emergently placed in the emergency room and patient was intubated because of hypoxia and unresponsiveness. Of note, COVID19 PCR was still positive. Emergent cardiac catheterization was done, which demonstrated a totally occluded RCA. PCI was performed and three drug eluting stents were placed in the RCA. The transvenous pacer was repositioned under fluoroscopic guidance. Vasopressor support was started in the cath lab. Upon ICU arrival, patient had rapidly escalating vasopressor requirements and persistent bradycardia, but the pacer was no longer capturing (despite maximal output). Echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction. Mrs. Wightman had three consecutive cardiac arrests.  TIMELINE:  The patient tested positive for COVID-19 on 11/24/20 and 12/08/21 via PCR.

The first concerning symptoms I had almost a week after the first shot and were shortness of breath and feeling like the top half of my body was swollen. I was worried this was an allergic reaction, since I do have experience with allergic reactions from having a food allergy. Vaccine site became red and largely swollen later that same day so I made an appointment with the walk-in clinic that evening, since it was a weekend. The symptoms I presented, swollen bi-lateral lymph nodes in my chest and under my arm, reminded the PA of cancer or even cat scratch fever so lab work was taken. The staff did find research about similar reactions to Moderna in women that mimicked signs of breast cancer. This reaction seemed to align with how I was presenting. I was prescribed steroids for the following week to help with the swelling. This help a lot and I got the call a week later that my lab work had come back normal.  I took the 2nd vaccine a month later and did not have any concerning side affects and little to no arm pain.  What's weird now, is on September 24th, I developed full body hives throughout the day and my joints began to swell. (the fingers on my hand were twice the size). My entire body wouldn't stop itching. So I took a trip that evening to urgent care again. This time, another location because the was the first appointment available. I had started taking Wellbutrin for anxiety/adhd symptoms earlier that month so that's really the only thing that's changed. I was prescribed another set of steroids and antibiotics in case my symptoms were from lyme disease. I have a follow-up with a rheumatologist because of bloodwork results. I have no idea if this is even relevant to the Moderna COVID vaccine. But I've never had anything like these two occurrences happen before. Totally would take the vaccine over again, I just have no idea what's going on.

The majority of my symptoms began 24 hours after the booster. I wasn?t feeling well when I woke up the morning after but still went to work. By 10a I was feeling unwell enough that I had to leave and come home. I was very fatigued, achy, and my eyes burned like when you have the flu. By 5p I was exponentially worse. I had nausea and could barely get my evening pills down. The lymph nodes in my armpits, neck and inguinal region were very tender, nothing like I?ve ever experienced before in past illnesses. I ached from my toenails to the hair on my head. I took my temperature and it was 98.3, normal by medical standards though I usually run 96-97. By 8p I was vomiting and kept that up until I went to bed about 11p. I was so miserable I didn?t even have the energy to cry about it. At 2p I woke up with heart palpitations, I think, brought on by dehydration. I had completely soaked the sheets and pillow with sweat. I contemplated going to the ER to get rehydrated (I avoid hospitals and doctors so to even entertain this idea is a testament to my misery), but remembered it would cost me my deductible, so I laid back in bed, chilling in the sweat-soaked sheets waiting for the grim reaper. By 3a I suddenly turned the corner and felt maybe I might survive this. I didn?t ache as bad and could hold down sips of water. By 8a (Saturday) I was eating toast and by 7p collecting my sister from the airport. Back to 85% on Sunday and 100% on Tuesday. What a ride that was, but can?t say I regret getting the booster.

I had lost half of my vision as well as experienced significant memory loss, loss of fine and gross motor control, issues with my speech and use of language, unable to do simple math, could not remember or figure out how to use a cell phone, and severe balance and dizziness issues. I spent a week in the hospital, most of that time in the ICU.  After being discharged from the hospital, I needed full-time care for over a month, then still needed a caregiver most of the time for several more months. I started intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy at a specialized neurotherapy center, which has continued for 6 months.  I have continued to see my neurologist, neuro-ophthalmologist, ophthalmologist, and primary care doctor on a regular basis. They have done numerous tests, including CT scans, MRI scans, MRA scans, vision field tests, tests for my retina and optic nerve, and blood tests.

Because of this, he went inside and sat down noted that he was diaphoretic.  He noted mild chest pressure.  He took a sublingual nitroglycerin which improved his discomfort.  His wife contacted emergency services and by the time of paramedic arrival his pain had improved but had not completely subsided.  Discomfort resolved in the ambulance and out.

The next morning I woke up and could barely get out of bed from the pain. It felt like a knife was in my back. I was able to get up and move around, but it was pretty debilitating as I sat around all day. I figured I slept wrong or a possible rib was out of place. I started to develop shortness of breath and rapid heart rate throughout the day as well. The symptoms got worse throughout the next few days and over the weekend. I pushed through the pain as I naturally have a high pain tolerance being a bigger athletically built guy. On Monday (7/23/21) I started to feel a bit better and thought I was recovering. It wasn't until the next day the pain came roaring back and at that point I knew something was going on. On Wednesday (7/28/21) I coughed up some blood in the morning.

On Friday (7/30/21) I coughed up a significantly more amount of blood and immediately knew I had to go see my Doctor. I made an appt immediately and went in that morning. After doing some initial tests, my Doctor sat me down and told me he thinks I have a blood clot in my right lung and need to go to the ER immediately to get diagnosed. After being emitted to the ER, all the tests and scans came back positive that a blood clot in my lung was correct. They told me I actually have multiple blood clots in both lungs.

Symptoms do best correlate with vertigo at this time. Concern for sensorineural hearing loss of the right side with history and examination. This does not appear to be BPPV at this time. Consideration and concern for labyrinthitis versus vestibular neuritis versus M�ni�re's versus acoustic neuroma. Symptoms do best correlate with M�ni�re's versus labyrinthitis with vertigo and hearing loss of the right side and tinnitus. No recent URI history. Patient was given prednisone 40 mg once daily for the next 5 days and is to follow-up as soon as possible. No ataxia or facial numbness. She is to continue taking the meclizine medication she was previously prescribed for dizziness as well. -Dizziness does not appear to be metabolic, dehydration or other differential listed below at this time. -Consideration for metabolic dysfunction, BPPV, neurologic dysfunction, dehydrations, thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte abnormality, anemia, infection, stroke, brain hemorrhage, AMI, or aneurysm.    2. Patient is to follow-up with ENT on Monday 5-24-21. Needs appointment. As today is currently Saturday she is instructed to call Monday morning and set up this appointment for Monday. It is important that patient be seen on Monday 5-24-21 for the symptoms if at all possible. Referral place.  May 24, 2021 Audiology HISTORY: Patient reported getting dizziness on 5/8/2021 after receiving her second dose of the covid-19 vaccine. She reported feeling very off balance and had bursts of spinning sensations that were exacerbated with head/body movements. She followed up with urgent care on 5/13/2021 at which time she prescribed meclizine and suspected to have BPPV. Patient stated that her dizziness did not improve and then a week later she had a decrease in hearing in her right ear, right sided tinnitus and loss some of her taste. She followed back up with UC on 5/22/2021, was prescribed prednisone and recommended to follow up with audiology/ENT urgently. Patient states that the prednisone has helped her hearing slightly but it is still not back to 'normal'. She also reports that her taste is better. Her tinnitus has not improved. Patient denied any concerns for her hearing prior to a few weeks ago. She does have a history of PE tubes as a child and recurrent ear infections as an adult. She denied otalgia, history of noise exposure and family history of hearing loss. ASSESSMENT:  Otoscopic inspection revealed clear ear canals, bilaterally. Pure-tone air and bone-conduction testing revealed a mild sloping to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and essentially normal hearing in the left ear. Speech reception thresholds were obtained at 20 dB in the right ear and 35 dB in the left ear. This was in good agreement with pure tone thresholds. Word discrimination scores were exellent (96%) in the right ear and excellent (100%) in the left ear.    Test reliability was good.   Tympanometric assessment was conducted due to asymmetric hearing loss. Tympanometric results revealed normal ear canal volume, middle-ear pressure, and TM compliance bilaterally. (Type A)   IMPRESSION:  Sudden HL, right ear  Mild to moderate SNHL, right ear  Essentially normal hearing, left ear  Normal middle ear function, both ears    PLAN: Results were discussed with patient. Patient was counseled on today's results. She was recommended to see ENT for her dizziness and sudden decrease in hearing on her right side. She was recommended to follow up with audiology per sudden hearing loss protocol.    RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow up with ENT  2. Follow up with audiology per sudden hearing loss protocol   May 24, 2021 doctor (ENT) at 05/24/21 1515 Chief Complaint: Sudden hearing loss of right ear.  History of Present Illness: 54-year-old female sent from urgent care for evaluation of hearing loss in the right ear. She states that she got the Covid vaccination on 5/8/2021. Within a few hours she had imbalance that progressed to true vertigo. The vertigo and labyrinthine symptoms have improved. She denies otalgia or otorrhea. Last week she noticed an abrupt change in her hearing in the right ear. She was seen in urgent care and started on prednisone 20 mg p.o. twice daily. She states that her hearing has improved. Associated with this was a loss of sense of taste which is also improved since starting the steroids. She does not feel her hearing is back to normal. She is experiencing tinnitus in the right ear. She has no history of otitis media in her adult life. She did have significant ear problems in her childhood. She did have several sets of tubes and an adenoidectomy. She also describes a surgery which sounds like a tympanoplasty in the right ear. Since childhood, however, she has not had significant issues with her ears until the recent above described complaints. Physical Exam: Alert. Right ear demonstrates postsurgical changes. The drum is intact. Middle ear cleft is aerated. Left ear demonstrates more normal landmarks and well aerated middle ear cleft. Neck:  Supple without adenopathy, mass, thyromegaly, or parotid enlargement.  Larynx and trachea are in the midline, nontender, and demonstrate normal palpable landmarks.  Submandibular glands are in normal position without mass.  Submental triangle is clear. Oral cavity demonstrates good dentition and healthy gingiva.  Lingual and buccal gutters are clear. The floor of the mouth demonstrates clear salivary flow without mass.  Oral tongue is fully mobile without lesion. Oropharynx:  Palate elevates normally without evidence of submucous clefting or bifid uvula.  Posterior pharyngeal wall is without lesions.  Tonsils are noninflamed. Nose:  Septum is functionally midline.  There is no evidence of nasal polyposis, pathology, active infection, or allergic changes. Head and neck neuro exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and react to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact. Assessment : #1 sudden asymmetric right-sided sensorineural hearing loss. #2 vertigo. #3 imbalance. Plan: I am going to have her discontinue the present course of steroids and start her on a high-dose prednisone taper. She will follow-up in 2 weeks with audiometric testing. We will proceed with an MRI with attention to the IACs to rule out intracranial process causing the sudden asymmetric hearing loss and imbalance. May 28, 2021 SMG MRI gadobenate dimeglumine (MULTIHANCE) Last given 5/28/2021 4:19 PM May 28, 2021 ? Emergency Room Chest Pain ? pt reports chest pain that began one hour ago at rest. Somewhat resolved upon arrival. Pt states she felt short of breath at the time. Dizziness is ongoing. Had MRI today for dizziness. Shortness Of Breath Dizziness 54-year-old female, presents with new onset lightheaded and dizziness, chest pain. Patient's symptoms started at rest at 8 PM, with initial lightheaded, dizziness, denies vertigo-like sensation. Patient then developed middle and right anterior chest wall pain, describes sharp in nature, radiation to right scapular region and right shoulder, resolved prior to arrival, somewhat brief in nature, no intervention prior arrival. Patient denies similar symptoms in the past. No known heart or lung disease. Patient states she has been getting lightheaded dizzy for the last 1 month after second Covid vaccination. Denies fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating or shortness of breath. Denies pain or swelling of lower extremities, recent surgeries or prolonged immobilization. Patient did recently get MRI brain earlier today, uncomplicated. No history of anxiety or depression. Patient is non-smoker. Denies any headache, double vision or vision loss. ED Course / Medical Decision Making Initially patient borderline hypotensive, not tachycardic or hypoxic, well-appearing, no acute distress, just with new onset lightheaded, dizziness, chest pain, brief in onset, at rest, radiation to back and scapular region, presentation concerning for ACS versus arrhythmia versus PE versus aortic dissection versus anxiety attack versus pleurisy versus costochondritis versus pneumothorax versus hypertensive urgency versus thyroid disorder versus electrolyte abnormality.   IV access established, lab results came back significant for CMP with normal sodium, no obvious electrolyte abnormality, normal renal function, negative initial troponin, normal TSH ruling out thyrotoxicosis, negative D-dimer ruling out PE along with no risk factors, CBC had white blood count 14, hemoglobin 14, hematocrit 44, platelets, 413   Chest x-ray showed no focal infiltrate or other acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. With chest pain radiating to back and shoulder, hypertension, and associated lightheaded and dizziness, CTA chest was performed, showed no evidence of aortic dissection or other abnormality   Repeat EKG and troponin showed no ischemic or dynamic EKG changes, continued sinus bradycardia, negative troponin x2, right chest pain-free making unstable angina, ACS highly unlikely, no cardiac risk factors. Patient felt safe for discharge home, advised of outpatient cardiac stress test, return precautions given.  June 1, 2021 Telephone with someone ----- Message from MD sent at 6/1/2021 8:56 AM CDT -----  Notify that the MRI demonstrates no evidence of intracranial process to cause the hearing loss. Continue with steroids. She should have a follow-up appointment with audiogram already scheduled. June 8, 2021, MD 54-year-old female follows up today for recheck. She underwent a course of steroids for asymmetric right-sided sensorineural hearing loss. She states that she noticed improvement on steroids but as she got to the tapering low-dose end of the steroid course she states that her hearing dropped off again. She has had an MRI which is negative for intracranial process.  Physical exam: Alert.  Ears:  TMs demonstrate normal landmarks bilaterally with well-aerated middle ear clefts.  External canals without edema, erythema, or tenderness.  Pinna and tragus are nontender to manipulation.  Periauricular skin demonstrates no pits, cysts, skin tags, or draining sinuses.   Posttreatment audiogram reveals no significant changes compared to the pretreatment audiogram. However, the patient does insist that her hearing was much improved prior to the low every other day dosing of the prednisone.   Assessment: Asymmetric right-sided sensorineural hearing loss. Plan: I reviewed the options of dexamethasone installations or another trial of oral steroids. She is hesitant to proceed with dexamethasone installations and would like to try another round of a oral steroid. We will have her come back prior to the end of the steroid treatment for an audiogram so that we can see if the steroids are resulting in improvement since she subjectively feels that she had improvement.  June 8, 2021 Audiology CHIEF COMPLAINT: Audio post prednisone, SSNHL-RE  ASSESSMENT: Otoscopic inspection revealed clear ear canals, bilaterally. Pure-tone air and bone-conduction testing revealed a moderate SNHL for 250-8000 Hz in the right ear and normal peripheral hearing for 250-8000 Hz in the left ear. Speech reception thresholds were obtained at 30 dB in the right ear and 15 dB in the left ear. This was in good agreement with pure tone thresholds. Word discrimination scores were excellent (92%) in the right ear a IMPRESSION:  IMPRESSION:  Moderate SNHL, right ear.  Tinnitus, right ear.  Dizziness.   Results revealed essentially stable results compared to compared to previous testing performed 6/8/2021. June 8, 2021, MD 54-year-old female follows up today for recheck.

We will have her come back prior to the end of the steroid treatment for an audiogram so that we can see if the steroids are resulting in improvement since she subjectively feels that she had improvement.  June 23, 2021, MD 54-year-old female follows up today to review her audiogram. She has had asymmetric right-sided sensorineural hearing loss. Post treatment with oral steroids did not demonstrate improvement. She is here to discuss dexamethasone installations. She is still complaining of episodic vertigo that is associated with nausea. It can be very incapacitating for several hours. This is more concerning and distressing to her than the hearing loss. Symptoms have not been controlled with meclizine. She has not identified any aggravating activities that bring the vertigo on.   Physical exam: Alert. Normal vocal quality. Right ear demonstrates myringosclerosis with a clear middle ear cleft.   Audiometric testing reveals no improvement with the most recent round of oral steroids.   I reviewed the details of what is involved with dexamethasone installations and the risks of no improvement and perforation. She wishes to proceed. Consent was obtained.   Details: Patient was placed in the semireclined position. Phenol was applied to the anterior superior aspect of the tympanic membrane. This was applied more superiorly due to the fact that she demonstrated significant myringosclerosis in the posterior mid tympanic membrane. Using a spinal needle through the anesthetized portion of the drum approximately 4 mg dexamethasone suspension was placed into the middle ear cleft. She was placed in the right lateral decubitus position for 30 minutes.   Assessment: #1 asymmetric hearing loss. #2 vertigo. Plan: Follow-up next week. Doctor will do the second installation.  June 27, 2021 Emergency Room Dizziness Pt has had dizziness on and off since her COVID shot in May, pt stated that today it is the worst it has been and she started to vomit several times. Nausea Vomiting Patient is a 54 year old female presenting to the emergency department with complaints of dizziness and nausea. She had intermittent dizziness since she received her second COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer) in May that became constant yesterday afternoon. She also lost her hearing in her right ear. They tried treating this with oral steriods, which didn't help. Last Wednesday they gave her a steroid injection, that also didn't help. She is scheduled for another one this Wednesday. She has had associated nausea and vomiting with her dizziness. She describes the dizziness as feeling like she is spinning. Her symptoms are worse when she opens her eye and nothing makes them better. She tried Meclizine, but immediately threw it back up. She has not tried anything else for her symptoms. She does have a headache. She denies trauma or injury, fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, changes in hearing, blurred vision, darkened vision or any additional related concerns.

She has already started injections into the ear to help with hearing. She was started on gaze stabilization exercises and balance today. She would benefit from skilled PT to improve the problem list below in order to improve walking, moving her head, getting in/out of bed, and positional changes.  Vestibular Problem List: Dizziness, Impaired gaze stabilization, Impaired balance, Vestibular hypofunction Prognosis: Good  June 30, 2021, MD Dexamethasone Injection Note: Subjective: Patient returns for dexamethasone 2/3. Patient notes dizziness got worse after her first injection. So far No improvement in hearing. Patient was seen in the ED on 6/27/21 for extreme dizziness. Exam: Ears were examined with microscope and are unchanged.   Procedure:   Right ear examined with microscope. Phenol applied topically to the eardrum. 0.1 mL of dexamethasone was injected into the middle ear space after creation of a drainage hole in the drum.  July 7, 2021 Physical Therapy Assessment: Note: patient is very dizzy and unsteady today rated 8/10 in severity. Yesterday she was much better. I reviewed her HEP with her and attempted to progress. She is to do standing VORx1 on days she feels good and return to sitting on days she feels more dizzy.   Goal Progression: fair Continue on Functional Deficit of: walking, standing, head movements, positional changes  July 13, 2021 Physical Therapy ASSESSMENT: Progressed compensation to walking exercises with mild/moderate dizziness with these. Overall is progressing nicely as she has not had a ""bad"" dizziness day since last Wednesday. Skilled PT necessary for patient to improve balance and dizziness in order to improve functionally with working, walking, quick movements.  Goal Progression: fair Continue on Functional Deficit of: walking, standing, head movements, positional changes  July 14, 2021 Audiology CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden hearing loss in the right ear.  HISTORY: patient had a sudden change in hearing in May. Her last audiogram was 6-8-2021 At that time she had normal hearing in the left ear and a mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. She has received three dexamethasone injections. She is here today to monitor hearing. She isn't sure if there has been any improvement in hearing. The tinnitus and unsteadiness are still present. She has been going to PT. She does notice some improvement with her balance since starting therapy.    ASSESSMENT:  Otoscopic inspection revealed clear ear canals, bilaterally.  Pure-tone air and bone-conduction testing revealed normal hearing in the left ear with the exception for a mild loss at 6000 Hz and a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. Speech reception thresholds were obtained at 55 dB in the right ear and 10 dB in the left ear. This was in good agreement with pure tone thresholds. Word discrimination scores using recorded NU6 word lists were (80%) in the right ear and (92%) in the left ear.  IMPRESSION:  Normal hearing in the left ear with the exception for a mild loss at 6000 Hz and a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.   Results revealed a change in hearing in the left ear compared to previous testing performed 6-8-2021   PLAN: Results were discussed with patient. She is following up with ENT. She would benefit from amplification in the right ear when medically cleared.   July 20, 2021 Physical Therapy Subjective: patient reports feeling much better. Has not had any really bad days for dizziness or balance in over a week. Fatigue is improving. She had a hearing test was did not show any improvements in her hearing. She is a candidate for amplification in several months.  OBJECTIVE  CTSIB: 30 seconds all conditions   FOTO: 80 (eval: 55) DHI: 18 (eval: 84)   Treatment provided today:   Neuromuscular Re-education - 97112 Number of Minutes - 97112: 30 Recheck of objective measures VORx1 walking horizontal and vertical x 50 feet no dizziness Walking with diagonal head turns x 50 feet no dizziness  Sept 9, 2021, MD She is medically cleared to proceed with amplification if she desires. She should make a follow-up appointment for hearing aid evaluation.  Assessment: #1 sudden asymmetric right-sided sensorineural hearing loss.  #2 imbalance. Plan: I have told her that we should repeat audiometric testing in 3 months.  If she is interested at that time she could consider proceeding with a hearing aid as her discrimination score is still 80% in the right ear.  Continue physical therapy for the imbalance which is also slowly improving.  She will call if she experiences any acute improvement or worsening in either her hearing or balance.  Otherwise no scheduled follow-up is been arranged. Sept 27, 2021 Audiology HISTORY: The patient was previously seen on 7/14/2021 at which time testing revealed a moderately to severe SNHL in the right ear and normal hearing sloping to a mild hearing loss in the left ear.   ASSESSMENT:   Otoscopic revealed clear ear canals bilaterally.    Given patient's otologic history, hearing aids are strongly recommended in her right ear only. We discussed their current communication environments and the hearing difficulties she has in those environments. Patient reported being in challenging listening environments such as at work, in group settings and hearing on the telephone (prefers right ear). We discussed hearing aid styles, circuitry options, and cost.    Connectivity and rechargeable options were also discussed with the patient. Patient expressed interest in both options.    Patient is interested in the Starkey livio i2400 ITC-R hearing aid in the pink color for her right ear.    A right earmold impression was taken without incident. Post otoscopic inspection was unremarkable for redness, swelling, bleeding or any residual impression material.    Patient signed hearing aid purchase agreement form and will return for a hearing aid fitting appointment.   Oct 8, 2021 Audiology Hearing aid information:| Fitting: Right  Manufacturer: Starkey Model: Livio 2000 ITC-R Color: Pink Medical clearance considerations were discussed with the patient.    There has been no reported otalgia, active drainage, sudden change in hearing, or unilateral change in hearing in the past 90 days. There is no reported acute or chronic dizziness, presence of significant air-bone gaps or visible cerumen accumulation in either ear. There are no notable visible congenital or traumatic deformities of the ear.    Otoscopy revealed clear external ear canals with visualization of TMs, bilaterally.    Real-ear measurements were performed to verify fit and meet targets at soft, medium gain and maximum power output (MPO). Hearing aids were set to #1 of target and patient reported overall satisfaction with the initial sound quality.    Hearing aid(s) were paired to the patient's smartphone. Phone call streaming capabilities and the app were demonstrated in office.    The patient was counseled on the use and care of the hearing aid(s) as well as battery recharging, battery safety and warnings. The patient practiced insertion, removal, and battery use without difficulty. The patient was provided information on the hearing aid and was given a hearing aid user's guide.

All I wanted to do was sleep. I had diarrhea. Mostly, I was not interested at food at all. I was trying to keep hydrated, but that wasn't working at all. And then a couple of days after I started feeling sick, I expected I got COVID but those tests were negative. So by 9/27, I was feeling quite ill and called my doctor's office and they had me come right over and tested. And that's when I had the confirmed COVID diagnosis. They immediately asked if I knew about regenerance. It's not available in town at this time. So the doctor's nurse called around and asked if anyone had the infusion and they found a place in (Privacy). I called up there and they confirmed that they had the infusion and I asked if I could get up there to get the infusion. This was late in the afternoon and they set me up an appointment for 4:30pm. On a normal day without commute, I can't get there within an hour normally. But the doctor said he would wait for me and he did. I did not reach his office until after 5pm. And he was there by himself at the time. It took about an hour to infuse, and he kept checking in with me to make sure that I was okay. And then I was able to go home. After that I still continued to have nausea and diarrhea and of course the cough which I still have. My oxygen level was down to 91 when I got to the doctor's office for the infusion. And after he gave me the infusion it was up to 97. And then for about a week afterward, I continued to have nausea and diarrhea. I think the diarrhea was because I only could hold down fluids. I was very tired most of the time and I wanted to sleep most of the day. And that lasted for about a week. I have definitely gotten better throughout the week.

The rest of my skin off and on felt funny maybe pins and needly but not bad. My face felt that the most. But the next day the issue was primarily my feet. I still have the rash on the feet. Just thought I would share as I looked it up and it said it is rare, but I thought maybe it is because people dont let you know. I gave myself a rapid COVID test because I looked that up and it said you might have a rash as your only COVID symptom but that was negative.

Chest Pain and Tightness (high d dimer levels); Significant Menstrual Cycle Changes; Extreme fatigue-9/4/21; Chills-9/4/21; Loss of appetite-9/4/21; Severe sudden sharp pain in left ankle-9/7/21; Pain in left knee -9/7/21; Phantom sensation then pain in right arm (non-injected arm); Pain in left shoulder...  I must emphasize that before this, I was a perfectly healthy 25 year old woman. No pre-existing conditions, no pain, not overweight.  Items 18&19:  High D-Dimer levels: I was feeling chest tightness on and off from 9/8/21. This escalated to chest pain on September 15th, to the point where I left work early to go to the ER. I strongly requested the doctor to run a d-dimer test. He told me I needed a CAT scan when he saw the results. They were nearly 3x higher than the top of the normal range for D-Dimer levels. Fortunately, there was no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.   Chest Pain and Chest Tightness: I never experienced this before the vaccine. Started 9/8/21, on and off. Still ongoing.  Significant Menstrual Cycle Changes--I had regular periods before. -Painful sudden cramps, even when I'm not having my period or near having my period -Spotting (I never spotted before) -Early 1-day period: I had a period for one day, September 12th. Way off my cycle. -Period started Sept 29th. For the 29th, 30th, and Oct 1st most of what I was passing were clots. Very large blood clots. On Sept 30th I got up 4 times during the night to change a completely full pad each time.   9/7/21: Sudden, sharp, severe pain in left ankle: I couldn't walk. This came on suddenly with no warning, as I was about to leave for work. On a scale of 1-10, it was easily a 10. This lasted for about 10 minutes, and then went away. Periodically, throughout the day I would feel a level 6 pain on my left ankle, so I would have to limp a bit, but then it would go away. Same day: While I was getting up from sitting down, I would feel pain in my left knee.  9/4/21 (day of vaccination) -Extreme fatigue: started 3:26pm, lasting the rest of the day. It felt like I was moving in slow motion. What normally would take me one hour to cook took me three hours. -Loss of Appetite: I had absolutely no appetite whatsoever. I literally had to force feed myself dinner. And I love food.  -Chills: At 8:00pm, my fingers started feeling very cold. At 8:16pm I had chills all over my body. Needed a warm blanket on top of the layers of clothing I was wearing.  Weird sensation in left arm (injection arm): 9/4/21 tingling and for lack of a better word(s), my entire arm felt strange. My left arm felt very light. I have never had this sensation before.   Phantom sensation/pain in right arm: 9/8/21 I felt the same pain and/or sensation in my right arm, the arm that did NOT receive the injection. It was in the mirror, or ""same"" location as the left side. At 7:27pm on 9/4/21 (injection day) I also felt pain in my right elbow.

Patient asked to be laid on the floor so administrator laid him on the floor at that point and was able to get him fully coherent and talking again.  The patient stated that they were slightly nauseas and having trouble moving their hands and had a little trouble speaking.  Administrator offered him some water and patient drank most of the water. Medical personnel arrived within 2 minutes and did an evaluation and determined that he suffered from psychosomatic from his extreme fear of needles and subsequently suffered a minor/short emotional seizure from the stress.  They offered to take him to the hospital for further evaluation if wanted but the medic stated that it was not necessary since it was a reaction to his fear of needles.

He has had some progressive memory problems and word-finding problems over the past months, but developed acute worsening mental status in the 3 days prior to admission.

He had anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.4, and subsequent anemia workup revealed an iron saturation of 3% consistent with iron deficiency anemia, as well as of vitamin B12 level of 189 consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.  He was treated with IV iron sucrose, of which he received 2 doses of 200 mg during his hospital stay.  He was also treated with 1000 mcg of vitamin B12 IM. For his COVID-19 infection he was started on remdesivir and dexamethasone.  He developed acute agitated confusion after admission requiring IV Haldol.  This was thought to be a steroid psychosis, and it resolved with discontinuation of the IV Decadron.  He is on oral Decadron 2 mg daily as an outpatient which was resumed.  He also seemed to develop some confusion from remdesivir dosing so this was stopped as well.  By discharge she was at his baseline mental status.  He was breathing comfortably without oxygen.   For his altered mental status he had a head CT on admission which was negative, and also an MRI of the brain with and without contrast which was normal except for evidence of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease. Discharge medications include the addition of ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily and vitamin B12 500 mcg daily.

Hemodynamically stable on arrival on exam, transient dip to the mid 90s systolic that has stabilized with liter of crystalloid.  Undifferentiated 71-year-old with fever will work broadly up for sepsis, the wound on his right heel appears to be healing adequately with no signs of infection.  Confusion may also be seen by electrolyte abnormalities, which will be assessed for on his sepsis work-up.   Work-up broadly negative for changes from baseline, with a stable hemoglobin of 10.9, stable creatinine of 1.27, and a bland urinalysis with a normal lactate.  He is COVID-19 positive, which likely explains his temperature.  Spoke with daughter, who notes patient was having some issues with short-term memory and following commands this morning, which were not present on exam or during my interview.   Patient passed his pulse oximetry ambulation test, staying above 95%.

He did say that he is dying and his time is limited even if they would elect for hospitalization   Return for Next scheduled follow up.     Patient is here with wife and daughter due to cough, shortness of breath, decreased appetite.  He is known to have interstitial lung disease, COPD, diastolic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension.  He was hospitalized a little bit over a week ago for similar symptoms.  He was felt to be in heart failure due to an elevated BNP at 503.  He was given IV Lasix but that adversely affected his kidney function.  He was transitioned and discharged to 20 mg of Lasix daily.  He is on chronic oxygen.  Since being at home he has not been doing well.  He has cough productive of clear sputum, shortness of breath and yesterday he had a fever of 100.6.   Yesterday and earlier today when we heard of his difficulties we recommended that he go to the emergency department.  He and his wife absolutely refused.  They are well aware that emergency department is the most rapid and efficient way of getting testing done.  In spite of this they wanted to come into the office to see me today.  Patient arrives in a wheelchair.  He appears to be in moderate respiratory distress.  He appears weak and frail.  I confirmed with patient and his wife their desire to return to the hospital.

Cannot differentiate between progressive interstitial disease versus superimposed infiltrate or edema. Minimal left effusion. No definite pulmonary embolus. See above.   RV/LV Ratio: N/A     END OF IMPRESSION:   INDICATION: Shortness of breath and sepsis and history of Covid positivity  Assess for pulmonary artery embolism.   TECHNIQUE: Enhanced helical CT scan of the chest was performed from the lung apices to below the diaphragm. 2 mm axial reconstruction with MPR coronal, oblique and sagittal images were created. 3D shaded surface images also created on a separate workstation and permanently stored.   CONTRAST: 80mL of IODIXANOL 320 MG IODINE/ML INTRAVENOUS SOLUTION administered INTRAVENOUS.   Quality of contrast opacification was adequate.   COMPARISON: 9/22/2012   FINDINGS:   There is a background pattern of severe interstitial disease which has progressed since 9/22/2012. Panlobular emphysema. Minimal left effusion. There certainly may be a superimposed diffuse inflammatory changes but I cannot differentiate from interval chronic changes worsening or superimposed edema or infiltrate. Within the mediastinum there are some small but very stable nodes present. There is an excellent bolus and there is no central or mid lung zone pulmonary embolus but peripherally very difficult to identify due to the underlying emphysema and chronic interstitial lung disease.

History of Present Illness     Pt is an 50 y.o. female who presented to the ED with worsening cough and shortness of breath.  Patient has a past medical history of COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, hypertension, anxiety/depression, type 2 diabetes.  She has chronic hypoxic respiratory failure from COPD, using 3 LPM of O2 at home.  Her symptoms started 6 days ago.  She had worsening cough compared to her baseline.  She also had worsening shortness of breath at rest and on exertion.  She has chronic bilateral leg swelling that is also worse.  She has had poor appetite.  No diarrhea or abdominal pain.  She also complains of intermittent chest pain which is usual for her.  She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on October 5, 2021 at an urgent care center.  She had an x-ray done at urgent care which showed multifocal pneumonia.  She was advised to go to the hospital but she did not want to.  She has persistent symptoms so she eventually went to the emergency department.    Patient received only 1 dose of Pfizer vaccine in January 2021.  She states that she did not receive the second dose because she thought that she had a reaction to the first dose -she claims that she had more coughing and dyspnea after first dose.     At the ED, patient was tachypneic with RR 24, she was requiring 4 LPM of O2 at the ED.  D-dimer was elevated 0.79.  CTA of the chest is negative for PE.  There is diffuse interstitial disease with mild groundglass opacity of the right lung apex that is nonspecific.  Lactic acid was 2.5.  Patient was given NS bolus 1 L at the ED.   Patient will be admitted for treatment of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She is at high risk for deterioration given COPD and heart disease.

1786568,10/14/2021,TX,61.0,61,,F,,"The moment I received my first covid vaccine it hurt my arm terribly and I could barely use my arm for the first 3 days and had a lot of pain from the injection site all the way down my arm to my elbow for next 8 days. Over the next 3 months I could point to the exact place the injection was administered and felt intermittent muscle pain from the injection site down to my elbow. It gradually got worse and worse until mid-June when my shoulder began to move around and pop and felt like it was almost dislocating. This began by simply raising my arm above my head. Ever since then my shoulder joint continues to move and pop and the muscles all the way down my arm to my elbow hurt almost constantly and sometimes extreme pain.  I can still point to the exact spot of the injection site and my shoulder continues to move and pop and makes my muscles all the way down my arm to my elbow feel pulled very badly and in addition, the muscle at the top of my shoulder that connects to my upper chest, right at the front of my armpit, is very, very tight and I sometimes now have muscle pain all across my chest and my upper back feels compromised now as well.  This is now 7 months since my first injection and I am still in a lot of pain and sometimes cannot use my arm.  The 2nd Pfizer Covid shot was administered on 3/26/2021 in my right arm and once I told them all the trouble I was having after the first shot, they used a smaller needle and made sure to place it in the right spot.  I have had no problem with the right arm.  It seems to me that the first shot was placed either too high or too deep.  I seem to also be having an inflammation reaction to stress in all the areas described in my left arm so am wondering if the Covid vaccine has caused all this or if it was the placement of the vaccine.  I have been in physical and massage therapy since mid-June, so in therapy once a week now for over 3 months.  I have a little better mobility in my right arm but am still experiencing all the pain and movement in my shoulder daily.  For 4 months there has never been a day my arm does not hurt and for 3 months prior to that, I had intermittent pain weekly.  I feel I am about to have to go to an Orthopedist and certainly hope this vaccine has not caused me to have to have surgery or permanent damage to my left arm muscles, ligaments, or tendons.",,,,,,,,,N,03/05/2021,03/05/2021,0,,OTH,,Vitamin D,None,,,,2,08/14/2021,,Y,,None

Patient is accompanied by his wife who is at the provider of history.  She states that he was in his usual state of health and he was sitting in his recliner in the garage which he normally does.  She went out to go check on him and asked him to come inside so she can change his diaper at that point the patient would not get out of the chair and look like no one was home.  She denies seeing any tonic-clonic like activity.  She called over a neighbor to help get patient out of the chair and when they were not able to, they called EMS.

On unknown dates in 2013 ( reported as a few days after the patient received her third quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) injection), she developed headaches, loss of appetite, increased trouble sleeping, tingling and numbness, extreme fatigue, and irritability. By February 2013, the patient academic performance had dropped, and she had symptoms of increased isolation. She returned to her pediatrician's office on 08-MAR-2013, with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, although there was no sign of infection.

The patient called an emergency room and they said they could not evaluate the patient over the phone. The patient could barely move and was feeling awful. It was reported that it did go away after several hours. The patient also experienced stabbing pain at the bottoms of feet and inner wrists.
