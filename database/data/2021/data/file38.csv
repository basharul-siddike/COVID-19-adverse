This time, I realized the connection and then looked back and resolved both symptoms occurred ~1 week after my vaccine.  The second time, the vertigo symptoms also lasted ~1 week.  However after the 2nd shot, I also had severe neck pain on the same side as my shot that radiated from my scapular area up to the the base of my skull.  This pain lasted for ~1-2 weeks, then both the vertigo and the neck pain resolved.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/24/2021,01/30/2021,6,None,PVT,,Mirtazapine,None,None,,,2,03/26/2021,,,,None
1139132,03/26/2021,NY,36.0,36,,F,,"Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician's office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor's appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children's BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/24/2021,03/24/2021,0,"Testing scheduled for April 14, 2021.",PVT,,5mg loratadine Ritual Prenatal Vitamin 1000mg turmeric  Probiotic,,Hashimoto's Asthma Gluten Intolerance  Chronic Hives,,,2,03/26/2021,,,Y,

Had blurred vision and body aches and bad headache and nausea. .Took Tylenol or hydrocodone which helped with keeping temp closer to 100 but I?d fall asleep and forget to take Tylenol and it would go back to 102. I didn?t have anyone to drive me that I felt comfortable enough to risk exposure in case it was an actual illness and not the vaccine. I considered calling an ambulance but decided to wait and see if I could get my temp under control. This evening I?m  at 100 again (I just took it again) but thought my fever had broken as I didn?t feel I was radiating heat like I felt when it was 102. My normal temp is usually around 97.

Although patient was a diabetic, he never had episodes that were life threatening, and was always able to manage to remediate with insulin or food.  Patient last spoke to a neighbor at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 14th, who said he appeared to be just fine and they scheduled a date with their dogs on Sunday afternoon.

Over the course of the next few hours, the pain got more and more intense to the point my husband felt we should go to the emergency room. When it would be in my chest area, it was excruciating. It would alternate between the center of my chest and then would be in the center of my back between my shoulder blades. I took five or six Tums over this period of time. I took two Tylenol at around 5:30 a.m.  The episodes lasted several minutes, would ease a little and then start up again. My temp started to come down around 6:00 but was still 100.1.  The pain in my chest felt like a spasm type pain, but when it would go to my back, that was a fairly constant pain. I finally agreed to go to the emergency room and my husband helped me get dressed. This was about 6:30 a.m.  Shortly after that, the episodes started spreading out to where they weren't as long or frequent.

By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain.

This eventually rose upward until the buzzing sensation concentrated on the top of my head, at which point I developed an excruciatingly painful headache.  About six hours after the vaccine, I started having a fever that eventually was so intense that I felt like my eyelids were going to peel off.  Then I started having chills.  I was so cold when I had the chills that I shook like someone having convulsions.  When I felt hot, I felt like my eyelids would peel off.  I drank some water at one point and felt like I'd vomit.  Then, a bit later, I felt like I was going to have diarrhea.  About eight-ten hours after the shot, it felt some my tendons were being twisted so that my bones were being ground together at the joints.  Then I started having muscle pain.  I have a very high pain tolerance.  This was ungodly.  I felt like I was being tortured.  This lasted 36 hours.  Then my hair started falling out.  The week before the vaccine was the snow storm.  I had no power for a couple days and no usable water for about five days.  I think that my unfortunate telogen effluvium is the result of extreme stress during the storm followed by extreme stress due to the vaccine.  However, given that I had beautiful. long, abundant curly hair, this is obviously not a felicitous event.  On 3/11, my levator scapula and rhomboid on the left side (shot side) started feeling hot and very hard.  Then my posterior and medial deltoid and triceps muscles started rippling (visibly).  Then the injection site swelled up so that it looked like I had a large grain of rice sticking out from my arm.  Then the anti tragus of my left ear swelled and turned red.  I developed floaters in my left eye.  This lasted for about 48 hours.  My hair, which had stopped falling out, started shedding again.   I have lost about 55% of my hair at this point.  My arm never really stopped hurting.  I have gotten my second shot (3/25) and am at present working through my adverse events after it, but will wait for a couple weeks before reporting them.  I don't know if I'll have ""Moderna arm"" again, so once the two-week mark passes, I'll report.

I had to cross my arms over my chest and stack on blankets to regulate. If I moved my arms for more than five minutes or pulled the blanket down, I began uncontrollably trembling. I still had trouble regulating my blood sugar on day two. It?s day three and no bumps and no chills. Less muscle fatigue as well. I am still pretty exhausted and tire easy when doing things. I did experience the common soreness in the muscle the vaccination was administered, but I figure that is normal.  I am hopeful that I am improving and out of the danger zone. I took Garden of Life Elderberry with added nutrients last night and today I took my normal detox probiotic. I have been pushing fluids and have broken my intermittent fasting to try and keep my blood sugar up.

Lower pitched sounds seem especially distorted/loud/resonant, kind of uncomfortably so.

My own voice makes my head feel like it's buzzing, if that makes any sense.  I just read that Bell's palsy is a possible side effect of the Moderna vaccine; I don't have any facial paralysis or anything like that, but the Wikipedia article I was looking at mentioned ""hyperacusis"" and ""dysacusis"", which seem like what I'm experiencing.  Maybe totally unrelated?  (Also maybe totally unrelated: my father had a brief episode of Bell's palsy when he was 40.  Treated with prednisone.  Never recurred that I'm aware of.)

I had seen this reaction before and told him not to worry and to put ice on it later when he went home.

I instructed patient to put his head between his knees as he was sitting, but he was concentrating on his breathing as we were talking to him. Customer did not lose consciousnessand his breathing remained stable. I stepped back into the pharmacy to continue work while the tecnician stayed with him to continue to monitor him. After a little bit I stepped back into the vaccination room and relieved the technician so that she could continue to vaccinate. His temperature was 98 and his color was looking better. He began to talk to me more, so we carried on a conversation as I continued to place cold compresses on his head and neck. After about another 15 or 20 min another tecnician came in with a fan to circulate air and  relieved me as I needed to check another prescription. The FE manager was talking to him and checking his BP the technician said that the customer told her that he had not been feeling well for the past 2 weeks and that he had seen a doctor and they were running some tests to figure out why he was feeling the way he was. The customer did not state any of this on his VAR nor tell us before his vaccine. He also told the technician checking him in that he had a little to eat that day as he was on site with his job most of the day.

The patient was given the vaccine in a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included diabetes and hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced arm swelling after the injection, then a little later on in the day experienced pain. The next day or so, she got bumps on the left side of the chest. Thought it was shingles and was given medicine for shingles but ended up not being shingles. She still has lumps, some were white and some have busted open, approximately 4. She still had arm pain and back. Arm was still swollen. Went back to doctor on 10Mar2021 and gave another round of antibiotics. Still has a stabbing pain from the from to the back. ""1 cm to 1.5 cm."" She had scheduled for a breast screening done. She was still having pain almost 2 months later. The patient provided further information: the patient only got her first dose of the vaccine. Her side effects began that day then gradually got worse. Her left arm was swollen at the injection site since 22Jan2021 and was still swollen at the time of the report. A couple of hours afterwards as the day went on, she had pain in her arm that went to her chest area. The next day (23Jan2021), she broke out with what thought as a nurse was shingles, but was just in one little spot, so she went to the doctor and gave her medicine, antibiotics, and then she took those for 7 days three times a day. The first antibiotic she was on when they thought it was shingles was azithromycin (ZITHROMAX). After then, the pain would not go away and has left scars to her left breast still, that look like white crust on them. She has pain in her left chest still from the middle to her arm down to her elbow. She has two different types of pain, and when she went back to the doctor a day before (10Mar2021), she was given more antibiotics. The pain goes from her front to the back of her shoulder blade and around and was a stabbing pain. Under her arm and going down she feels a pinching sensation that won't go away, and was all the time. They wouldn't give her the second vaccine dose while she was on antibiotics that appointment reached its due. The pharmacist came on 05Mar2021 which would be her third appointment to get the vaccine and told the pharmacist her reaction to the COVID shot. The pharmacist asked to look at her injury and then wouldn't give the vaccine to her. Her doctor gave her some pain medication that would be good for nerves. She can't take gabapentin and doesn't like to take pain pills for the nerve pain, so she does paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen every other time to relieve the pain. She says she has been taking paracetamol 500mg extra strength twice a day by mouth, and ibuprofen 400mg twice a day by mouth. She was wondering if there was any information on if her pain would get better since she doesn't want to stay the same or for it to get worse that what it is. It was a nagging pain that she can't seem to get rid of and every once in a while she loses her grip with her left hand though not too much and she can grab again what was slipping. The gabapentin for her nerve pain gave her side effects, she was taking 300 mg one pill four times a day. She took about three days worth and starting in Feb2021 she thought. The new antibiotic given on 10Mar2021 that she takes for the bumps on her chest that won't heal up was cefdinir 300 mg. She says after her vaccine her skin blistered up like shingles centered to her left breast in the middle, which she thought originally would spread all around but it didn't, it stopped right there. She says that the spots were white and puffy, and some left a bump around in them where they healed up. She says her doctor wanted her to get a mammogram done, which is scheduled for the first Monday in Apr2021. No labs were done, ""they just looked at them"".

On that Monday March 14 I had new hives, this time on my left hand and right arm near by elbow. I took pictures of my hives as well if anyone needs them.  At this point I made a telehealth appointment with my doctor. She looked at them and said they were mild, and I should be ok to take the second shot. She prescribed me an epipen to take with me just in case. She told me to take Claritin during the day and benadryl at night.  Since then most of the hives have gone away, but I am still waking up with one or two new ones every day, in different places. Today there is a hive on my right thigh and left knee, both small but itchy.   The hives are small, the size of a quarter or smaller. They are red, initially they look swollen and are really itchy. Then they flatten out to be red and kind of splotchy, not as round as when they first form. They are super itchy. Then they fade away very slowly.

I finished the prednisone on March 26. On March 27, I woke up with the rash all over my neck, back, chest and arms. It was a much more raised and a much darker red. I sent pictures and called my doctor?s on-call number. Because the rash was so bad all over my neck, they wanted me to go to an urgent care or ER to be checked out. I went to the ER and was prescribed a stronger steroid (40 mg). Today (March 28) is my second day with that medication. The rash is still here but maybe a bit lighter. I don?t think I?ll be comfortable getting the second vaccine. My kids have anaphylactic food allergies, so now I?m thinking they should receive the vaccine either.

The second shot had much more effect on me. I was very active the day of the second shot and the next day. Then it hit me hard.

Unfortunately the depression hit me also.

I have tachycardia (SVT) but control it with atenolol.  I went to the ER at where I had an EKG, ches xray, and blood work.  My heartbeat reached 143.  While waiting on the test results, I noticed a rash forming below both my knees.  The ER doctor returned with the news that all tests came back normal with no accounting for the rapid heart beat other than the Pfizer vaccine.  He checked the rash saying it was likely another reaction from the vaccine.  He gave me medication to reduce my heart rate, prescribed hydrocortisone for the ""rash"" and released me.  By the next morning, my heart rate was back to normal but the ""rash"" had spread all over both legs.  On Saturday, March 20,, 2021, I went to a medical clinic to see if I could Triamcinolone Acetonide on the rash as the hydrocortisone wasn't helping.  The NP identified the rash as petechiae and prescribed Triamcinolone.  She could not prescribe an oral steroid xplaining that not enough info is known about the Covid vaccines and possible interactions with steroids.  I then followed up on Monday, March 22, 2021, with my PCP who said I had a bad case of petechiae and did more blood work to rule out vasculitis.  The day before getting the vaccine, I competed a 7-day course of the antibiotic Nitrofurintoin for a UTI and suggested to her that perhaps I  had a delayed reaction to it.  However, she ruled that out saying I would likely have had a reaction before the day after completing the medication.  She called me back the next evening on Tuesday, March 23 advising that all blood work came back negative, that the Pfizer vaccine is  likely the cause of the petechiae, and that I should probably not get the 2nd vaccine.  I asked her if she thought I would be okay getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and she said yes, if they will give it to you.

This worsened followed by an increased headache and dizziness. I left work early. Once I got home and took my temperature (tympanic) it was 100.3 at 130pm. Next symptom happened within the next half hour and it was pain in both thigh muscles. The pain felt how muscles would feel the day after a hard workout. This muscle pain began to effect all the muscles in my body. This worsened to joint pain even in my fingers. The fatigue was very severe. I went to sleep around 230pm and slept and off until 3-23-21.

He did swab it but we don't have the results back yet. The wound is not as red today and my husband is feeling better. Should he get the second vaccine? the doctor said this was the second patient he saw that day with the same infection at the vaccine site. I received my vaccine the same time and had zero issues. The doctor thought maybe his arm was not sufficiently alcohol swabbed but I know he was swabbed as was I as we were in the same room. He has severe asthma so we wanted the protection from the Covid vaccine but want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine? I have taken photos each day so I can share what his arm has looked like",,,Y,,,,,,N,03/14/2021,03/21/2021,7,3-26-2021 the doctor swabbed the arm infection but we don't have results back yet,PHM,,"Breo, Amlodipine Besylate 5 mg, losartan/HCTZ 100/25 mg",none,Asthma,,,2,03/28/2021,,Y,,Sulfa

As everything worsened and couldn't control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I'm still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I'm left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can't work right now,  but the most concerning is I'm still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.

So tired she was swaying on her feet, but could not be convinced to lay down.  After 2 days we were able to get 50 mg Trazadone from our doctor.  After sleeping for 6-8 hours she then did another 24 hours awake. We upped the dose to 100 mg.  By this point the event had started to pass.    During this time we also noticed mom was running a low fever in the morning. 99.5 - 100.5. It would go away in the afternoon.  During this time mom was hallucinating - having conversations with people who were not there.  Mom's hearing declined during the event as well.   As of 2 days ago mom's temperature seems to be back to normal in the morning.  This ""event"" has impacted mom's mental and physical decline.

She was also one of those people who end up having to throw away a lot of medicines because she was allergic to them. She has had seven spine surgeries and gets a lot of shots so she was not scared of needles. The patient had the first shot on Friday in Mar2021. The patient had a not so pleasant reaction to it immediately. The patient heart started racing right after they injected and then she felt dizzy in Mar2021. The heart racing went away pretty quickly but the dizziness did not. For the first 15 minutes the patient had a hard time forming sentences and talking. It felt like when someone wakes you from a dead sleep. Like wanting to tell people to go away, go away. Then she felt head drop to right shoulder and slide off of feet. That caused pain because she have had multiple neck surgeries in the past and jolted her out of whatever was happening. Then that passed. At 4:30 she told them she need to go before rush hour. She felt like she was driving stoned. Very carefully like she was under the influence of something. The dizziness gradually faded, and she went to bed. The next day she had a headache, felt fluish, and tired. And then eventually everything went away. She took a Benadryl an hour and a half before getting the vaccine because that's why provider told her to do. She did take Benadryl before the vaccine just in case, she was unsure if she took it after or not, she thought about it. As soon as she got the injection of the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine she could feel something going on with her heart. Then she got really dizzy. While waiting in the parking lot, there were two paramedics that stood there and spoke with her because she had mentioned that she thought she was high risk. The first thing she noticed was that she was wondering why they wouldn't go away, she was dizzy, and then she felt her body slide off the seat and her head rocked to the right and hit her shoulder and she realized she nearly passed out and she was jolted back by the pain in her neck. On the way home she was still dizzy and as she was driving she felt like she was stoned. She was very careful getting home and went to bed at about 1830 and just watched TV. The dizziness went away overnight. The next day she had a headache and was tired and then by Sunday she was okay. She was concerned that her doctor will tell her it was an allergic reaction and she just need a straight answer as to whether the second shot was recommended for her. Outcome of the events was recovered in Mar2021.

Medical history included facial neuropathy, sleep apnea from 2003, and Guillain-Barre syndrome from 2001. Patient said she had Guillain-Barre syndrome 20 years ago and has residual neuropathy from that. There were no concomitant medications. Patient have not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. Patient called about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot, as she was supposed to call about possible side effects, to report. She said that she had her first dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and hasn't had her second yet. She said that the first dose was injected in the morning, around 08:30AM. She said that there was a sticker on her vaccine card that says mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech, and (withheld), she didn't know what that means. She said actually that was abbreviation for (withheld), her vaccine provider. Her side effects included fatigue on an unspecified date in 2021, which she thinks a lot of people do have. She didn't know if this was available but she was hoping to advice about getting her second shot. She has had a runny nose since day after getting the shot, so since 26Feb2021, it hasn't stopped. She was not saying this was from the shot, it could be chronic runny nose, but it didn't stop. She said that the worst thing she was calling about was she has facial neuropathy flare in 2021, described as slight facial neuropathy which felt like it has flared since the shot. She was calling because she was nervous about second shot in 2021, since it flared with the first one a bit. She didn't want this to get worse, she can live with it currently, but she has heard people have more problems with the second dose and she didn't want to risk full blown neuropathy. She has done no treatment for the neuropathy, but for the runny nose there were a couple nights she took Benadryl and today she took Claritin, so put that she has taken sporadic over the counter stuff. No further details provided about Claritin or Benadryl. She has been experiencing continuous runny nose, flare of facial neuropathy, and fatigue. She was worried in getting the 2nd dose in 2021 and wanted to have recommendations as her doctor was reluctant in giving an advice whether she may have the 2nd dose or not. The patient reported that facial neuropathy flare as serious medically significant while the other events was non-serious adverse events. Patient was advised by the Pfizer colleague of the overall safety summary that indicated throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group.

Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19.
