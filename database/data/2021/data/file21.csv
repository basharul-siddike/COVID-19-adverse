Although I have full ROM in the hands at rest the fingers are curled and my index finger points outward. The worsening occurred each day. I had electric type pain in the left foot. The previous double vision worsened in the left side. The symptoms then spread to the right side. My balance worsened.  I had an MRI of the brain and neck, contrast and non-contrast approximately a week after symptoms began. I went to the ER as the symptoms worsened. My left leg was dragging, I had trouble walking. IV toridol decreased symptoms. I was given Motrin at home with no result, then another anti-inflammatory, then a steroid, all with no results. I had several blood panels. After a month of symptoms we did another brain MRI and full spine MRI's all negative. We did extensive blood work for autoimmune, inflammatory and eight or so other items such as Lyme, Syphillis, arsenic and I'm not sure what else. The nuero exam showed normal reflexes and strength.  He did some nerve conduction tests. The right calf was normal. He couldn't assess the left because of the tremor. I feel my legs will 'give out' and feel weak when performing activities and was told it's from the tremor. I have cramps and spams in the left foot and lateral calf. My balance is much worse, I fell over today while walking. These are all symptoms that are similar to the brain tumor in that it mostly affected the left side, but they are much, much worse. The deficits I had from the tumor in 2008 have been completely stable.

I feel asleep and woke up a couple hour later and the top upper lip swelling had started to go down, but my bottom lip had swollen and looked like a sausage.

1036964,02/17/2021,OH,35.0,35,,F,,"Within a minute, there was a different taste in my mouth. Shortly after, began to feel incredibly hot, flushed, burning, and tingling throughout body. Throat and tongue also became tingly. It was like a wave that moved through my body. After waiting it for a few minutes to see if there was improvement, there was a strong ?wave? that came with all of the above, but my heart started racing with palpitations. HR was 120. The heat feeling became worse. Would describe the feeling as a CT contrast feeling, including the feeling of voiding or heat/burning of the bladder. Tongue and throat more tingly. A few minutes later the feeling all became stronger and this is what became the strongest ?wave? of the feeling with my heart beating incredibly fast. The heat/burning/tingling (including the mouth and tongue) were severe. HR 148. Nauseated and lightheaded/dizzy. Transferred to ED.   In the ER, epi was administered due to the persisting flushing/burning of the skin/and tingling of the throat and tongue with tachycardia. IV fluid bolus, Benadryl, and zofran were also administered. Tryptase was obtained approximately 35 - 45 minutes after injection. Tryptase 10.8. Improvement in all symptoms following epi/benadryl.    Was monitored in the ER and within approximately 1.5 hours, the burning feeling returned, but was centralized in my core (felt internal versus skin). Abdomen/chest area with intermittent burning. At approximately 2-3 hours, the tingling began to return. Slight tingling of the tongue, lip. The burning feeling continued to worsen, now back to the skin as well as the core, and additional benadryl was administered in addition to solu-medrol. Prior to this, the attending physician was concerned that my heart rate remained elevated into the 110/120s 3 hours after the epi administration and she recommended transfer to an adult facility for further evaluation. Due to the burning in my chest, EKG was obtained. Sinus tachycardia. Slight chest tightness, duoneb provided. Had not taken inhalers throughout the day and felt similar to tight chest/difficulty getting deep breath in relation to asthma. Relief after the second dose of benadryl and duoneb.   BP remains elevated from shortly after vaccine administration.   Transferred to MVH at 4-5 hours post vaccine. En route to facility, HR 130s and BP lower (90s/60 and 90s/50s) - Medic did not think was accurate BP. At MVH, cardiac rule out completed with additional EKG due to development of some chest pains and return of core burning sensation as well as ongoing tachycardia. EKG remains sinus tach, troponins normal. Requested anxiety medication to see if that would help with heart rate. Low dose ativan given. Minimal change to resting heart rate, still elevated. Also received 4 baby aspirin and tylenol for extreme headache. Oxygen saturations  were 97-100%. Oxygen saturation at MVH was 90-93%. Attending physician not concerned with going home and saturation still being low 90s as long as there was no shortness of breath. Discharged home with methylprednisone 4 mg 6 day pack and pepcid prescriptions. Resting HR was low 100s at time of discharge. Instructed to continue with antihistamines every 6 hours. DX anaphylactic reaction.    Husband checking on me while sleeping, oxygen saturation in sleep 89-91%. After awakening, saturation improved to 94-95%.   At home, burning skin and core feelings persisted. Tingling of the throat/tongue/lips continued to be intermittent. Antihistamines helped to relieve symptoms. 26-28 hours after vaccine, symptoms were very strong, was suffering from extreme burning and tingling of the mouth/lips. Considered return to ER but oxygen saturation was okay. HR elevated. 125 at rest. MVH attending physician encouraged me to try to not use the prednisone packet unless necessary/return of symptoms. Started prednisone with the return of symptoms.    Continued on routine Benadryl until myoclonic jerking became too pronounced, discontinued on 12/25/2020 and changed to hydroxyzine. Jerking remained but improved and was less bothersome. Continued taking daily dose of Claritin, daily pepcid, daily aspirin. Hives developed 12/25/2020.   Return to ER on 12/29/2020 as the jerking was intense and felt to be in chest along with palpitations. EKG and troponin was good, only notable thing physician reported on labs was an elevated WBC count. Did not discuss jerking.    To PCP on 1/4/2020 - discussed adverse reaction. Continued problems after vaccine include: intermittent tachycardia (low 100s at rest occasionally vs norm of 70s/ low 80s), higher heart rate when active, burning skin (feels similar to bad sunburn feeling), random pains and occasional brief numbness/tingling/tremoring in muscles/extremities, jerking (continues to improve - recommended change off of benadryl/hydroxyzine to zyrtec), increased need for inhaler, bubbling sensation in left lower abdomen.

I could not keep any water down. I also had a small amount of diarrhea.

I ended up calling urgent care, they had a traveling urgent care,  come to me on the evening of Feb. 16th. I was treated for dehydration and adverse effects of the vaccine. I was given an IV. They took blood work, and beyond my elevated heart rate and being dehydrated, so did not find anything to be wrong.   As of today, Wednesday, Feb. 17th, I feel fine.

Prior to the vaccine I had been stable on topiramate and was only experiencing about 1-2 migraines a month and was fine with sumatriptan. However, after the first dose of the vaccine I experienced muscle pain across my arms/shoulder/shoulder blades/neck that attributed to my head hurting. This pain has not subsided since the second dose but has decreased in its severity. Basically, the pain is still there, but it is not as excruciating. I am able to still go about my day, and I no longer have the arm/shoulder pain, but the migraines have not gone away. After speaking to my neurologist, he feels that the vaccine most likely triggered the muscle pain as that is a very common reaction which spiked the migraines to resurface, which is why I wanted to report this AE, especially because it has caused my prophylactic treatment (topiramate) and acute treatment (sumatriptan) to BOTH fail and I am needing to have my medications readjusted in order to deal with these migraines that have not subsided over the 3 weeks since the first vaccine.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said ""my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down."" The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated ""I am so allergic to medicine."" She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was ""so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix."" States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about ""2 pages long.""  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn't want to take the second dose and probably won't. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn't had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn't want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn't in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn't feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn't know, it doesn't sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn't know about COVID but he hadn't heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn't feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn't know why she didn't feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn't know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn't think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200's for underactive thyroid, it's minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn't have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won't take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?

The emergency room staff did not know how she got Bell's palsy, but knew she had the Pfizer COIVD-19 Vaccine and were kind of assuming the Bell's palsy was a reaction to the vaccine.

I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64+ and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.

This time it appeared to be heavier than usual and had some blood clots. However, before I was on birth control it was always that way. Sometimes it is a little heavier when I have more stress or the weather is not ideal. My cycle started around 2/4/21. On 2/8/21, I combed my one cat. She scratched and bit me and has done so in the past. She and I both are vaccinated and I?ve never developed any infections because of it in the past. On 2/10/21, I noticed a cluster of red pinpoint dots underneath my skin on my arms and chest. They weren?t bumpy, warm to the touch, itchy or anything. It just looked odd and I didn?t know how it happened. I work with a Nurse Practitioner and she suggested I go into to a clinic as those usually indicate an infection is developing. I went to the Urgent Care and was treated.  He did blood work on me and informed me that my glucose was a little low.  It was suppertime so that didn?t surprise me.  He told me there was no signs of infection in my blood work but was prescribing two antibiotics in case one developed. When I was getting my meds at the pharmacy, a call was coming through that I didn?t recognize so do to phone scams, I didn?t answer it. I started the antibiotics. Then over the course of 2/13/21 and 2/14/21 weekend days, I felt more fatigued than usual, nauseated, had a decreased appetite and still had my menstrual cycle. I still didn?t think much about it as a side effect of the antibiotics was nausea and decreased appetite and the fatigue could be related to it being so cold and winter usually affects my depression symptoms. Then on 2/14/21 I noticed my lower abdomen was covered in those red, pinpoint blood dot clusters and there were unexplained bruises on my body. I took a shower and when I went to wash my legs, my pelvic area was completely bloody and a blood clot dropped into the bathtub. Never has that occurred when I have my period. It looked like I had just given birth it was so much blood. I became nauseated and dry heaved several times. On 2/15/21, I sent a message to Dr asking what was happening to me. He called me and informed me that he had tried to call me the night he saw me because he saw my platelet count was only 11,000 and should be a minimum of 140,000. Dr asked that I return to Urgent Care as soon as possible.  I arrived there around 12:30 pm that day. He had bloodwork done again on me. My platelets went down to 9,000. I explained that my menstrual cycle would not stop and it should?ve but I just keep bleeding. Dr contacted a Hematologist that informed him that recently the blood disorder Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been linked with the COVID19 vaccination in rare cases. I was scheduled to be seen by a Hematologist and put on the medication prednisone to build up my platelet count. I returned to Urgent Care for blood work again on 2/16/21.  My platelets went up to 30,000. I met with Hematology on 2/17/21 and had blood work again, platelets 28,000. All providers looked over my medical record and noted that since my gastric bypass surgery in 2015, my health has been good, my blood work has been normal and I live a clean lifestyle.

Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.

She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.

TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical CT images of the chest were obtained without IV contrast administration in the usual manner. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained. Automated exposure control was utilized for radiation dose reduction.  COMPARISON STUDY: 3/20/2007.  DISCUSSION: Severe patchy bilateral consolidations, nonspecific, consistent with bilateral pneumonia. More confluent alveolar opacities are present in both lower lobes, particularly the right lower lobe, consistent with atelectasis or more focal alveolar  infiltrate.  There is a tiny/small right pleural effusion. Chronic appearing pleural thickening also noted, particularly in the peripheral right lung, accounting for the pleural thickening seen on chest x-ray.  The portions of the lungs which are not densely consolidated demonstrate nonspecific mosaic opacities with groundglass opacities and other intervening lucent areas..  There is cardiomegaly. Calcifications are present in the aorta and coronary arteries.   Small amount of gas in the left subclavian vein, right atrium and main pulmonary artery may be from a peripheral IV.  Enlarged lymph nodes are present in the aorticopulmonary window, right paratracheal and azygos regions of the mediastinum. An endotracheal tube projects between the clavicles and carina. An NG tube passes below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Extensive surgical findings are noted. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen shows large calcified gallstones.

Denies difficulty swallowing)  Assessment/Plan:  DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition:  1. Allergic reaction, initial encounter   Symptoms:  Patient had second dose of COVID 19 vaccine today at 1230 p.m. She states at around 530 - 6 p.m. she started coughing and felt like that was a hair caught in the back of her throat, states throat is tingling and looked in the mirror and states her tongue is swollen. Feels that her heart rate is abnormal, but states it could relate to anxiety. COVID vaccine clearance needed if future booster needed. Informed patient to follow up with PCP if needed after ED visit. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient got her 2nd dose of COVID vaccine today at noon.  At 5 she started feeling a bit of a tickle and scratchiness of her throat and her mouth felt very dry.  She was concerned about allergic reaction.  No shortness of breath chest pain rash itching hives or any other concerns.  She has not taken any Benadryl.  The patient is in no distress.  Symptoms been going on for 3 hours.  This could be a very mild allergic reaction.  Therefore I am giving her 50 mg of oral Benadryl.  Given the symptoms been going on for 3 hours and I do not see any angioedema I am comfortable letting her go home at this point in time.  I do not think steroids would be beneficial.  She will return here if worsening and I instructed her to use Benadryl 50 mg every 4-6 hours if needed.

The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch.

History:  I am a 72 year old male.  I have high blood pressure treated with 25 mg Atenolol.  I have had repeated operations for skin cancer on my face and head.  I have had pre-cancerous polyps removed through my anus.  My doctor can provide a much more detailed history if required.  First Covid injection of Moderna:  This went well and the only side effect was a sore arm.  I only noticed it if I touched it, otherwise there was no pain.  It went away in a few days.  Second injection:  I was anticipating additional side effects after reading up on the subject.  I was not surprised when my arm hurt.  It was constant and worse than the first time, but not alarming.  I also had a headache which did not surprise me from the research I had done.  The headache felt like my brain had ballooned inside my head and was in compression.  It was uncomfortable, but not painful.     Now to the matter that concerned me:  I was unable to sleep.  This was not something I had read about anywhere in my research.  Being very tired and knowing how important sleep is I decided I should go to the Emergency Room of the local hospital to be looked at.  They told me that none of the doctors, nurses and technicians had ever heard of this effect.  A technician said he would do a world-wide research on the subject and get back to me.  3 hours later he said that he could find no reports on the subject.  They conducted blood and urine tests that they said returned results showing everything normal.  They told me that they did not want to prescribe sleeping drugs because they can be dangerous and were also concerned about any side effects that may result from interactions with the Covid injection that were unknown.   They suggested I talk to my family doctor and then released me.  After 40 hours (yes forty) of being awake I broke out in a profuse sweat.  I reduced the heat, removed clothing and put a fan on.  The next thing I was aware of was 4 hours later when I awoke from sleep.  The sweating had stopped and the headache had stopped.  Purpose:  I have two purposes for writing to you.  First, because my doctor had recommended it.  Second to offer myself as a research subject in the matter.  I recognize that the world is suffering terribly and is trying to understand everything about the pandemic in order to better deal with it on a continual basis.  To that end I recognize the value of research and want to help in some small way.  Thank you.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/17/2021,02/17/2021,0,Blood and urine tests conducted on 17 Feb 2021 at Hospital.
