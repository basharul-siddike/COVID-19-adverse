The patient reports that he began having symptoms on 11/20. He is vaccinated for COVID but has not had a booster. He has had poor appetite, chills, fevers, cough and shortness of breath as well as abdominal pain and diarrhea. His wife came down with symptoms on the same day. They believe he was exposed when he was sent to Hospital on 11/8 for follow up on his drop in hemoglobin. He had a pulse ox at home and was noting hypoxia in the 70's prompting him to come to ER for evaluation.    In the ER the patient was found to be hypoxic to 60% on room air on presentation. He quickly progressed to HFNC with a NRB mask due to being a mouth breather. He had labs showing significant elevation in BNP and D dimer. There was high clinical concern for PE however due to AKI a CTA thorax was unable to be obtained. Dopplers of upper and lower extremities obtained. He had an elevated procal and was started on antibiotics and had blood cultures ordered. The hospitalist team was contacted for admission and further management.   Of note the patient's daughter reports that his xarelto was stopped on 11/2 as his PCP noted a drop in hemoglobin to 12. He had his toe amputated last month and then had some epistaxis earlier this month and so the decision was made to stop the xarelto and continue to monitor.

BPs controlled at 120/75 on enalapril 2.5 mg po q.am.  No other medications. PMH?at age 75 had successful but painful DaVinci bypass of ?widow-maker? lesion but all other coronaries were 100% patent.

First Moderna vaccine on 2/6/2021 (lot 030120A). Flu-like symptoms next 24-48 hours, better on tylenol.  Second Moderna vaccine on 3/6/2021 (lot 048821A). Flu-like symptoms next 24 hours, better on tylenol.  2 weeks later (~3/20/2021) had an episode of legs feeling funny or weak when she stood up.  Didn?t tell anyone, but it passed by the next day.  3/6/21 to 11/16/21: saw primary care doctor for checkup (07/14/2021). BP was 120/80 as it had been this whole time even at other doctor offices (saw ENT once and oncologist another time). No illnesses.  Third Modern vaccine on 11/16/2021 (lot 013F21A?lot # may have been transcribed to her vaccine card wrong?what?s the ?F? doing there?).  3 days later (11/19/2021) had episode of feeling unusual and with legs feeling weak progressing to arms. Here?s how it progressed. That day she went to put something in the gas oven (gas leak was ruled out the next day). But she felt like her legs were weak and she felt a bit light-headed so thought it wasn?t safe to bake. She turned off the oven. She carefully made her way about 10? to the dining room table, using her arms (and some legs) as support.  She then called 911. They told her to unlock her door (apartment 1200 sq-ft) that was about 20? away. She did, and as she moved from furniture to furniture piece, the weakness worsened and moved up to the arms also; and she felt more light-headed (?out of it?).  She unlocked the door and immediately sat in the rocking chair about 2 ? from the door. The paramedics arrived and found her conscious and alert but looking a little out of it. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital around the corner. In the ER, her BP was 280/120. They reflexively put her on IVFs (NS) and gave her I.V. hydralazine, which brough the BP down to about 190/100 or so, and she felt better. Seeing repeat BPs in the 190-210 range, they decided to keep her for overnight observation. They quadrupuled her dose of enalapril to 5.0 mg po BID (am and hs) in the hospital.  AFter the morning dose, her BP came down to about 190/90; at night it was about 185/80. She ended up staying, partly at my suggestion, for another 2 nights (3 days total stay).  The night and next day of admission, COVID was (-); Stroke and spinal impingement at the vertebral fracture site were ruled out, as were cardiopulmonary problems (ECG, CXR normal). And she could walk and had not felt light-headed since unlocking the apartment door.  And she wanted to go home the entire time (real pain in the neck).  In the hospital, PT & OT assessed her ability to walk, and she did great.  At d/c, her BP was 180/60, which they felt was OK, but it had been as low as 160/80 the preceding 24 hours (once).    She followed up with her PMD 8 days later (couldn?t get appt) and BP was 180/70, and noted this was indeed very high for her. So PMD continued enalapril at 5 mg po BID.   The episode never recurred nor has she felt light-headed.  My theory is that the spike protein this vaccine forces out bodies to produce is saturating the ACE (and probably other anti-Htn receptors).   So after the 3 doses of vaccine, each producing spike protein from the mRNA transcription (turns the body into a vaccine manufacturing facility, essentially), the spike protein progressively bound up more and more ACE and other anti-htn receptors.  On dose #2, It took 2 weeks of spike protein production to probably cause pretty high BP (never measured, but likely not as high as the 3rd dose), and that?s why she had a similar but lesser reaction 2 weeks after the 2nd dose.  Then after the 3rd dose, her ACE receptors were already pretty saturated, and it didn?t take much more spike protein production to bind up the ones that were left.  That?s likely why, on the 3rd dose, she suffered nearly malignant hypertension that made her feel light-headed and experience caudal to rostral weakness. Once the BP was lowered in the ER, she felt she could walk again, and through the hospital stay. And the doctor on the unit said that indeed, very high BP could cause exactly the reaction she had.  She remains on the 5 mg po BID enalapril dose and with BPs around 150-170/60-80.",,,,,Y,3,,,N,11/16/2021,11/19/2021,3,COVID (-) on 11/19/21 ECG and CSR on 11/19/21,UNK,,enalapril 2.5 mg po QD (in a.m.),hypertension,"osteoporsis with vertebral compression fracture, mid-thoracic","Moderna #2 (lot 048821A) on 3/6/21--88 yo, same reaction but  milder. resolved  after feeling weak when trying to stand from sit",,2,12/03/2021,,,Y,none

She was vaccinated for COVID-19 and had no sick contacts.  She complained of worsening fatigue for 2 weeks prior to admission.  She was unable to get up from the floor after a fall.  She laid on the ground for 22 hours without moving.  Family brought her to the emergency department.  She admitted to decreased intake prior to admission.  In the emergency department, she was positive for COVID-19.  She had mild hypoxia and was placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacity.  BMP showed a creatinine of 1.39 which was AKI.  She had an elevated CPK of 4300 from immobilization.  White count was 12000. Procalcitonin was mildly elevated.  She was treated with IV Rocephin and azithromycin for a 5 day course due to community-acquired pneumonia on top of COVID-19.  She was treated with fluids initially.  Her CPK and creatinine improved. She did receive dexamethasone for five days, discontinued at discharge. She is not a candidate for remdesivir due to time from onset of symptoms. PT/OT recommended skilled nursing facility at discharge however patient is adamant in her refusal to consider this despite discussion of risks/benefits. Husband works from home and is able to help care for her. Evaluated by pulmonary rehab and discharged with home oxygen 2L with exertion as well as home healthcare services.

The first thing that raised my concern during the vaccination was how slowly the vaccine administrator was pressing the syringe into my arm.  Second, after getting through my skin layer, the administrator had to apply additional force (while still pressing slowly) to get the needle into the muscle tissue.  Third, she slowly pressed the plunger to inject the vaccine into my arm.  Fourth, and most significant, when she pulled the needle from my arm, a significant amount of the vaccine was flowing down my arm from the injection site.  The injection  was one of (if not the most) uncomfortable injections I recall ever receiving.  Being concerned about the slow technique, I commented to vaccine administrator that I never recall having an injection done that slowly.  Her response was that her slow technique prevents or minimizes pain.    In the days following the booster injection, I did not experience the usual soreness around the injection site.  Prior to this booster during the 2021 calendar year, I received Moderna shots #1 and #2, shingles shots #1 and #2, and a flu shot.   All of them resulted in my arm being sore for a few days at the injection site.     Having seen much of the medication leak out when the needle was removed, I believe that the lack of soreness following the Moderna injection is evidence that an insufficient amount of the vaccine made it into my arm.    The most significant concern is that I do not believe that I received enough of the booster for it to do its job.   Given the possibly of not having received a sufficient amount, is it reasonably safe to simply repeat the booster to boost both my immunity and confidence?",,,,,,,,,U,11/15/2021,11/15/2021,0,,PHM,,N/A,None,None,,,2,12/03/2021,,,,None

History and physical were performed in the emergency department where patient will board until a bed becomes available, patient's wife was present at bedside. Patient states that he has been feeling poorly since the dual administration of his 1st COVID vaccination and flu shot on November 20th.  He has been feeling fevers, chills and fatigue.  States that measured home temperatures were never elevated.  However, after the 1st few days post vaccination administration, patient reports worsening cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness that worsens with deep inspiration.  He reports intermittent sputum production which is yellow, denies presence of blood.  Patient does endorse that for the past 2 days he has been working on clearing land in building a new home, for which his shortness of breath and fatigue has been a hindrance to his work.  Patient's wife states that patient requested the route to the hospital when his chest tightness was severe in nature, given his cardiac history.  Patient's wife is fully vaccinated.  Patient states he is unaware of any known exposures.  He does not wear home oxygen.  Patient denies headaches, dizziness, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, numbness or tingling in his extremities. In the emergency department patient was afebrile.  He was tachycardic and hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen saturation.  Initially patient was started on 4 L via nasal cannula, at the time of our conversation he had been increased to 6 L via nasal cannula.  Pertinent lab findings include an elevated creatinine of 2.22.  BNP was within normal limits at 195. Troponins were within normal limits at 20 and then 21 at recheck.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.  Chest x-ray showed abnormal opacity in the left upper lobe extending from the hilum, abnormal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac left lung base.  Probable areas of left-sided pneumonia.  Suspect minimal strandy atelectasis in the right lung base as well.  Rapid COVID PCR was positive.  Due to concerns of acute respiratory failure with hypoxia secondary to COVID pneumonia, as well as acute kidney injury, patient was admitted to hospitalist service. Patient is a full code.  Discussed with patient our intention to admit to the hospital, which will include judicious fluid administration, and COVID treatment including Decadron and remdesivir.  I did discuss with patient and his wife at bedside his code status, and his comfort level with respiratory escalation should it be needed.  Patient is agreeable to are all respiratory intervention including mechanical intubation if needed.  Patient states he already feels better and would like to go home, at the encouragement and urging of his wife, patient agreed to stay to be admitted to undergo fluid administration and COVID treatment.  All questions and concerns answered at this time. Brief history and medical decision making:  51-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and heart failure preserved ejection fraction, presented with shortness of breath.  Patient just received his 1st COVID vaccination and influenza vaccination 7 days ago.  Patient presented with cough sputum production and shortness of breath.  This is accompanied with worsening dyspnea on exertion.  In the emergency department he was hypoxemic and tachycardic.  Chest x-ray revealed left upper lobe opacification as well as patchy opacification in the left lung base.  Procalcitonin elevated.  COVID-19 positive.  Will start treatment for COVID-19 respiratory failure with superimposed bacterial community-acquired pneumonia.  Will start ceftriaxone/azithromycin.

My face felt like lava and all my joints were inflamed. There were moments through the night where I'd feel an intense pain in a specific area, it felt like my bone being struck with a hammer. Other times I'd shiver as if my nerves were vibrating. I could feel a throbbing/pulse in my head and ibuprofen seemed to do nothing. My entire body was wrenched in pain, even my eyeballs felt injured. Upon getting out of bed after such a miserable night of supposed rest, I walked up a flight of stairs and had to sit down towards the top because I suddenly felt nauseous. I quickly went back down the stairs hoping I would make it to the bathroom in time. As I lifted up the toilet seat I took a seat on the edge of the bathtub. All I wanted was to wipe off the rim of the bowl with a Clorox towel but even that small task seemed too daunting as I knew my body was starting to turn on me. Throughout my whole being I could feel a wave travel through me as if an electric current had zapped me. Nausea was no longer my concern but rather a dread like something was about to happen but I didn't know what. A pulse hit me which felt similar to when a limb falls asleep and slowly regains circulation however this was all over. The pulse happened twice then my sight started to blur, tunnel vision, as I began to fall backwards into the tub. I never lost consciousness but as I began to feel normal again I instantly felt cold all over. My head felt like I had stuck it in the freezer and chilled me to the bone. As I got out of the tub and snuck a glance in the mirror I was pure white, there was absolutely no color in my face. I went to the living room to rest on the couch and focus on my breathing so as not to have the nausea return. As I did this my whole body felt like it had been asleep, similar to my limb reference earlier, and caused me pain as it regained blood flow. Within 5 minutes I felt normal again but proceeded to have joint pain and fatigue for the rest of the day.

1921224,12/03/2021,FL,59.0,59,,F,,"On April 6, 2021  I was vaccinated with Janssen COVID-19 vaccine one dose lot #042A21A at 3:40PM.      After vaccine I immediately had left sore arm at injection site (lasted one month), dizziness (dissipated after day one), headache, and fatigue.   After one week I had swollen lymph glands under both arm pits for 3 months. Two weeks after injection I had leg pains in both legs.    Hypertension increased and I had to double my hypertension medicine, make it extended release and add a second class of hypertension medicine.  I relieved leg circulation pain by taking a circulatory remedy for 5 days, I was diligent on taking hypertension medication and added Natto kinase in place of aspirin (can?t take aspirin) to reduce any type of blood clotting.  This occurred around the time woman reported blood clotting and drug went on hold. The leg pain was temporary and has dissipated since then.       Since I?ve had the vaccine, I have had  constant fatigue (more than usual) and sporadic headaches have continued over last 6 months.  Some days are worse than others.  I also feel achy with joint and muscle pain.     On 7/28/2021 I tested borderline positive for ANA with no specific indications and then repeated ANA on 8/6/21 testing positive with antibodies indicating two forms of lupus- Systematic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Neuropsychiatric SLE, 4 months after taking vaccine. With our government making this vaccine mandatory and with the CDC stating this vaccine is ?safe? I assumed that I would not have any side effects so I was surprised when I saw my ANA turn positive for lupus.   My ANA antibodies went from borderline positive of 1.4 to definitely positive at 1.8.  I repeated ANA testing on 10/14/21 and my ANA levels remain positive at 1.8.     The risk of taking this vaccine so far has outweighed the benefit from the vaccine.  I have repetitively done the COVID PCR test and I have never been exposed to COVID 19 or any variant in the last 2 years to warrant needing a COVID vaccine. Now, I may have lifelong challenges with side effects from lupus- systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Neuropsychiatric SLE lowering the quality and possibly shortening my life.     SARS COV2 AB IGG bloodwork was repeated on 8/30/2021 and I now have COVID antibodies from the COVID vaccine.  My other concern was micro clotting issue from vaccine as it relates to understanding the headaches, I have experienced in the last 6 months after the vaccine.      A D-dimer test was completed on 8/30 and  10/14 and so far, shows no micro clotting to explain intermittent headaches.   D-dimer will be repeated periodical as well as ANA for lupus over time.    I discussed above with doctor on 8/24/2021 and covered some of the short-term side effects with doctor in previous office consults on May 17, and June 22 to adjust my hypertension medication.   I assumed these symptoms were temporary and would go away so I did not highlight this with my doctor as a possible side effect from vaccine. It was not until my ANA test came back positive and I have other symptoms which are not normal for me (headaches, extreme fatigue, muscle/joint aches)   that I started thinking maybe I am having  medium to long term side effects from the vaccine.     Since my blood pressure was high and doctor had to adjust hypertension medication twice, I established myself with a specialist on July 14 and had (2) heart tests August 5th (ultrasounds EKG and treadmill stress test). I received my ultrasound EKG test on September 29, 2021 and two new issues were found related to my heart which I never had before the vaccine.  I now have mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  I consulted with  a specialist, on 12/2/2021 as it relates to the  EKG/Ultrasound results done on 8/5/21 and asked if the mitral valve and tricuspid valve regurgitation could be COVID vaccine related .  He said ?nothing comes without a cost? meaning every vaccine comes with risks and benefits.   I initially did not report short term side effects in VAERS because my side effects from vaccine were minor.  Now that I am seeing side effects which may be longer lasting, like lupus and heart valve issues I feel it?s my obligation to report these issues.",,,,,,,,,N,04/06/2021,04/06/2021,0,See dates on blood tests and EKG/ultrasound  listed in item 18 above.,PHM,,All supplements stopped two weeks before and one month after vaccination to not interfere with vaccine effectiveness.

1921231,12/03/2021,CT,67.0,67,,F,,"3/31/2021, the day after receiving my second Covid vaccination, I was reclining on a couch, relaxing and reading a book. I noticed that the ""sound"" of my tinnitus was breaking through my focus for reading. I have experienced tinnitus for many years, and it had never before broken my reading focus to this painful extent. Since this initial surprise, the tinnitus ""sound"" has continued as louder and more sharply penetrating than I had previously experienced - and has increased in intensity. Since April I have had difficulty sleeping (not a tinnitus effect previously), difficulty concentrating in stressful conversations, and difficulty relaxing, as I no longer have quiet available to me. Before March 31 my mild tinnitus did not interfere with the sense of quiet a quiet place afforded. I have also had fantasies of suicide, as suicide would appear to be the only avenue to enjoying quiet again. (Actually, I can enjoy quiet in my dreams - I know I've woken up when I hear the ""eeeeekkkkkk"" again!) The sound is highly annoying, inherently nerve-racking, and hurts my ears and head! (~8000 hz at ~20-30 db - Think fingernails on a chalkboard).   My internist referred me to an ENT for a hearing test; earliest available appointment 5/14/21. The hearing test showed some loss of hearing and tinnitus. Re the tinnitus, the ENT advised, ""It's your brain, not your ears, so I can't do anything for you"". In early August my cardiologist prescribed Lisinopril (.25 mg) to address heart function issues (Not treating high blood pressure - my normal blood pressure is 110 over 70, with 16 oz. of coffee in the AM!). Lisinopril reduced my blood pressure to ~ 90 over 60, with coffee). I took this medication 8/11/21�8/27/21 but found that it dramatically increased the feeling of fullness in my ears - and my tinnitus felt like it was intensifying - and I slept very badly during these two weeks (first fantasies of suicide) - so I discontinued taking Lisinopril. While taking Lisinopril I contacted my ENT as the tinnitus seemed to be worsening. My ENT tested my hearing for a second time on 8/24/21 and reported no changes from the 5/14/21 test. The audiologist in the practice recommended full-spectrum CBD to help me fall asleep. I tried this whenever I was having trouble falling asleep, beginning 8/25/21, but eventually found that whenever I thereafter awoke in the middle of the night I suffered a drug-addled, nightmarish struggle to fall back to sleep. (More 3 AM fantasies of suicide).  During this period, 8/25/2021�11/04/2021, I took approximately 45 full spectrum gummies. With increased difficulty achieving a full nights sleep, I tested Night-time Sudafed (1 tablet at ~11 PM each night for 9 nights beginning 10/27/2021) to help me fall asleep and reduce my congestion (And help tinnitus? - I am normally fairly congested and have always had a poor sense of smell!). Night-time Sudafed dropped me off to sleep, but later when I awoke I suffered chills and weird feelings of anxiety, then lethargy the next day. In desperation, on 11/05/2021 I contacted my internist and an endochronologist friend. My friend advised me to ""go clean"" - no Sudafed, no CBD for 4-5 days - which I did. I have not taken Sudafed or CBD since. During this period I also stopped drinking coffee and alcohol to ensure neither would interfere with my sleep. 11/06/2021 my internist prescribed Lorazepam (.5mg) to help when I cannot fall asleep. I took my first Lorazepam ~11/13/2021 and have taken ~8 since then.  I have also reduced my intake of salt and begun taking a multi-vitamin. I have not been able to identify any correlation between diet, activity... Sound therapy (cricket sounds, forest sounds) has helped offset the effects of the harshness of the tinnitus ""sound"",  helping me to relax enough to fall asleep. Since August I have spent at least $1,000 on various headphones, speakers, and apps to deliver soothing sounds to my brain! In early November I also identified several ENT's who advertise as addressing tinnitus in their practice.

1921443,12/03/2021,AZ,41.0,41,,F,,"Started the evening of 11/18 ? my left back thigh and inner right thigh were itchy.  I could feel a bunch of small bumps.  At 1:30am I woke up with intense itchiness.  I took a picture to see the bumps.  They were smallish welts/hives that looked similar to the reaction I have to mosquito bites.  I put on over the counter hydrocortisone, which helped calm the itching.  Then, I started to notice that I was getting itchy other places ? my back, side, stomach.  I continued to put hydrocortisone to ease the itchiness.  By 8am on Friday the 19th, I had red patches in various places ? legs, stomach, back, upper arms.  I took a Claritin and continued to use hydrocortisone to ease the itching throughout the day.   The hives would come and go throughout the day. 11/20 ? woke up with red itchy patches in armpit and surrounding area, back, thighs/groin/leg crease area.  I took Benadryl and used hydrocortisone throughout the day.  The areas continued to stay red, would itch and hives/welts would come and go.  I went to Urgent Care that evening.  While I mentioned to the medical assistant that I think it could have been caused by my booster, I don?t think I relayed that information to the NP who treated me.  I received a shot of mtheylprednisolone 125mg and famotidine 40mg at urgent care and a prescription for hydroxyzine 25mg.  Shortly after the shot in the butt, my lower back burst into hives.  The NP told me if it didn?t get better soon that I need to go to the ER.  The hives eventually went away within the hour.  Interestingly, when I took the bandaid off from shot, my skin was bright red where the bandaid adhered to my body.  No itching or hives, just bright red.  I then started to notice that my skin would turn red with the smallest ?trauma? ? scratching, holding a bag on my arm, seams from clothes.  Sometimes it would cause hives to appear and itch.   11/21 ? I woke up with all of the red patches gone, no itching, no hives.  The red patches that I had in my leg crease and lower back had turned brown (not my normal skin color).  By 11/22, the brown color had disappeared.  I continued to take the hydroxyzine. 11/22 ? most of the day was free of any redness, hives and itching.  By the evening, I had started to notice red areas on my arm, back, and stomach.  But I don?t recall it being too itchy. 11/23 ? Woke up with a red itching and hurting patch in my armpit and surrounding area.  I took Benadryl (not hydroxyzine because I had to work and feared the drowsiness) and used hydrocortisone.  That evening, I used my son?s Aveeno Baby eczema balm on my armpits to try and prevent another flare. 11/24 ? woke up with large red patches/flares on my thighs and sides, hips, back.  I used Eucrin baby eczema cream to help and continued with Benadryl. I would take Benadryl during the day and hydroxyxzine in the evening/bed.   11/25 ? random and various areas continued to flare and itched.  Continued the same: eczema creams, Benadryl and hydrocortisone.   11/26 ? Now, I?m having small red bumps all over my stomach and thighs.  Sort of looked like measles.   The measles like red bumps persisted.  They were bothersome and lightly itchy.  Still had random areas flare and itch.  11/27 ? I started to notice red marks on my face, but they didn?t itch or hive and would disappear relatively quickly.  For the most part, the flares/patches/hives were concentrated to legs, upper arms, stomach, back and backs of legs.  Neck, face, lower arms and lower legs were not affected.  But now I?m starting to notice that red marks appear on lower arms and face but quickly go away.  11/29 ? the bumps appeared again on the back of my thighs ? as it did when it first started.  Also present on back. 11/30 ? had some ?trauma? to arm from rubbing against purse.  Red marks and hives appeared.   12/1 ? woke up with hives now appearing on top of thighs, side of back/hips, and leg crease area again.  And were itchy again.  Red patches appeared on upper arm/armpit area.  Until this point, my feet hadn?t really been affected.  This evening, I had intense itching on my left foot.  It turned red, but no hives.  The redness and itchiness eventually went away within 30-40 mins.  12/2 ? went to family nurse practitioner about it.  And to get a referral to the dermatologist and she also recommended a referral to an allergist.  She prescribed cetirizine 10mg daily for the next three weeks.   12/3 ? most of the day was mild.  Very little redness, itching and hives.  However, as I approached the 24 hour mark for the cetirizine, I?m noticing various areas starting to itch.

1921787,12/03/2021,MA,19.0,19,,F,,"In summary, patient is a 19-year-old with new onset diabetes.  She has hyperglycemia without acidosis.  She has received her first dose of subcu insulin.  She understands her diagnosis.  She is eager to be able to go home but understands the need to be admitted for education.  In discussions with the family, family is concerned that diabetes is from her Pfizer Covid vaccine which she received in August.  I have discussed this with pharmacist.  That time.  Is quite long to be a side effect.  Additionally endocrinopathies have not been previously described.  The family is reassured that we are taking that concern seriously.  They also understand that this is unlikely to be related to the vaccine.  As per attending admission policy, endocrine fellow spoke to accepting attending.  Patient transferred to inpatient unit for education and diabetes management.  Admission HPI: Patient is a healthy 19F with PMH of vasovagal syncope, eczema and allergic rhinitis who presented to the ED with 4 weeks of polydipsia and polyuria.     Patient is a student and began noticing that she had a dry mouth and was excessively thirsty a few weeks ago. She jokingly said she had diabetes but did not think much of it. She also noticed she was urinating more frequently, waking up in the middle of the night to drink and void. She has also had a 10lb weight loss over the last few months. Denies any abdominal pain or nausea/vomiting or other preceding infection or illness during this period.      She is home this weekend visiting her parents, and noticed she was drinking gallons of water, so she wanted to have this evaluated, so she went to her pediatrician where she had an elevated blood sugar level and was referred to  ED for further evaluation.     In the ED, she was HDS, mildly tachycardic with a well-appearing with an exam notable for non-tender abdomen. Labs were notable for glucose 319, BOHB 4.45, pH 7.35/41.9, bicarb 20, AG 17, and HbA1c 12.4%. Reassuringly, her kidney function was normal. She was diagnosed with new-onset diabetes, but was reassuringly not in DKA. Endocrine was consulted and she was initiated on a subcutaneous insulin regimen and admitted for further management.   Confidential social history:   - Sexually active, uses protection and is on birth control. Has her period currently.  - Uses alcohol and tobacco socially, no recreational drug use  - Feels safe at home and school  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the endocrine team with diabetes mellitus.   The patient presented with several weeks of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. The blood glucose level on arrival to the ED was 319 mg/dL.  Initial laboratory evaluation included bicarbonate 20 mEq/, anion gap 17 mEq/L, venous pH 7.35, and ketonuria. Hemoglobin A1c was 12.4%.  This presentation was diagnostic of diabetes mellitus.   Given a history of elevated BMI, a gradual onset of symptoms, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was considered most likely. Confirmatory antibody testing is pending.   Patient was initiated on a basal-bolus insulin regimen with Lantus and Humalog. The insulin regimen was adjusted to achieve adequate glycemic control prior to discharge. Final insulin regimen is in the patient instruction section of the discharge summary.   Family education was provided by diabetic nurse educators and nutritionists regarding basic concepts and skills for diabetes management.  At the time of discharge, parent(s)/primary caregiver(s) demonstrated understanding of these concepts and adequate technical skills for safe diabetes management until the follow-up visit. Following discharge, patient and family will follow up with Endocrinology team at Hospital.",,,,,Y,2,,,Y,08/10/2021,11/01/2021,83,Diabetes related labs,PVT,,ethinyl estradiol-norgestimate 35 mcg - 0.25 mg 1 tab PO daily,"vasovagal syncope, 4 week hx of rhinitis",,,,2,12/03/2021,,,,none

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of heart rate increased, sinus arrhythmia, and included beta blocker. Clinical course: Consumer stated, well she was not thinking to get anywhere she took the booster and she regretted taking it when she did and she went through similar side effect that she had, when she first took it and then it subsided but unfortunately she took it when she took the fresh pack of birth control that she hadn't taken in a while, it was a full strength of birth control because the pharmacy sent her sun damaged birth control and she was stupid and dumb and put trash in her body. And the same week she got the booster she started the birth control and she had been feeling really sick obviously when, in her early 40s but she didn't believe she was going to menopause but usually when you didn't have enough estrogen in your body was when you are going to be sick but she was feeling sick when she was taking full strength of the birth control (Unspecified birth control pills). So that was strange and it didn't make sense and she didn't know what was going on with her body ever since she got the shot. She had been feeling, she mean actually she felt better after certain day and then Friday after she took it on Tuesday she had a really bad side effect, she was hot and cold, hot and cold, and then she had a really bad blood effect. She took it on Tuesday and then on Friday she was sweating profusely and then ever since then she just keep sweating every day and sweating and then the sweating stopped and then she just started, after the sweating stopped she was just hot. And her heart rate keep going up and it keep waking her up, my heart rate was pounding out of my chest and it was hurting her chest and so, she didn't know if it was the birth control that was causing it but everybody was like oh no usually when you didn't have enough estrogen that was when your body was going to go crazy and have these symptoms, not when you starts putting the estrogen back into your body. She didn't take too much not being one for 2 month (as reported). But unfortunately, she took your dose right when she started the fresh pack after 2 month she didn't have the vaccine. So, she got your shot the same time when she resumed taking my birth control and ever since she took it she felt more dehydrated that she did from the beta blocker (Unspecified medications) that she took for anxiety not for low blood pressure and she felt every day she felt hot throughout the day even though her body temperature was normal she was feeling hot, but then her heart rate periodically goes up when she started to sweat, and she went very sick and her mouth got very dry, she got very dry. And no matter who she call, if she went to hospital, if she went there to find out what was going on. She hops this wasn't a permanent side effect, she was hoping it was the birth control not the vaccine because she did so well with it the first time and it was many months before she took it again, so was just stuck in a bad place she was just miserable and she couldn't get better. No one can tell me what to do, she didn't take her birth control for 1 day which she guessed was not enough to get it out of her system, if the birth control was causing this but that will be strange for the birth control to cause hot flush, and a higher heart rate and thats usually signs of not getting enough estrogen, so was just totally lost and confused, she didn't know what to do. When confirmed the name of the vaccine as Pfizer COVID booster shot, consumer stated, yes unfortunately she took it at wrong time. Consumer stated, she went to pharmacy that she got the shot at would have given her you guys number to call during the week because she had been miserable for so long. It was been 2 weeks. Consumer stated, she understand but she wish she would have been given this number when she called earlier in the week and then she could have called them when she got off from phone with you, at the time of this report she had to wait for Monday and she had to still be in this condition where she was getting even less sleep than she normally got and she just felt sick and she just felt hot and she just felt like she couldn't do anything and it was just that she went to sleep and if she was lucky enough to fall asleep she was waking up with her heart pounding. But the pharmacy that she called right now gave her you guys information but she wish they, the other pharmacy would have given it to her because then she would have called you earlier then she would have been able to get transferred to medical info, at the time if this report she had to wait and it was not fun, it was very hard on me. She had been hard on her body and the time of this report she rushed to get this when she should have she should have been more patience and she should have been herself, felt more lethargic and tired like she had always was because of lack of sleep and sleeping problems. And now she was suffering with pill and she might, if this was something that's going to be permanent for rest her life she was going to like, this was like misery my beta blocker she took at 3 o'clock and then nearly by 7 in morning my heart was pounding out of her chest. And birth control was usually when you didn't have estrogen in your body you get the effects not when you are putting that. You seemed very noticeable and she appreciated that and she was sorry she was very overwhelmed and nobody will see her nobody will talk to me, nobody will see me, everybody was like just wait it out like how much longer to wait it out. If she didn't take the birth control yesterday and she know one day is probably not enough to take it out of her body, it was birth control, it will take more days to take it out of her system but she was just overwhelmed she never expected it to happen she was just really sad at the time of this report. She was sorry she was really exhausted. Consumer stated, she had sleep issue but at the time of this report she had even more sleep issue and sweat issues and this and that. Consumer stated, she had to start all over again, okay alright she appreciated your patience letting her to get this out, she just really wish she waited, she really wish she was afraid she wouldn't be able to get it and she was living with 2 geriatric people and she was afraid she wouldn't be able to get it, she possible just ran, she should have sit in shower and relax but she didn't and now she was suffering consequences of not listening and taking sun damage birth control for 2 months. At the time of this report she didn't know, everybody was like it could be Pfizer, it could be birth control or combination of two, she just want to felt better, she just want to felt normal even her normal was so horrible and she barely, she didn't get enough sleep and she felt sick on her beta blockers, at least her normal was lot better that was normal as now. Fast heartbeat, chest pressure. Extreme sweating. Dehydration. Nausea. I did perfectly well with the first two. Stress levels too high. Due to tampering of vaccine. Spoke with health care professional (HCP). Concerned. It wasn't immediate. Got it on a Tuesday. Tuesday night. She felt sleepy. She had insomnia. A fresh pack of birth control. Been off the birth control for quite a while, two months at the time of this report. She believe she had anal retentive. She was close to eight months to her previous vaccine. Two days approved. First two at the health department. Pharmacies were so busy. Her upcoming birthday. Fill this out. Medical conditions. She just gave her the paper. Broke the honor code signed something they were immunocompromised. Technician somehow tampered. Extra Pfizer vaccine in bottom. Maybe she just had a bad reaction. She really wish she had went. Sweating profusely. Yeast infection so much. Bedridden, Heart beat out of her chest. Her gut told me not to take counter. Sinus arrhythmias. She waited it out so long. She didn't want to go into an ER during covid. She was considered obese. She did not want to get sick. Sister genetically similar to me. Clinical pharmacist. She had inflammation. She had shortness of breath, chest pain. Experiencing that. She didn't experience with the first two shots. She got it on the 21st it was approved two days later. Few days after her booster. Heart rate in the 90s. She was sweating so bad. Got it on a Tuesday, Friday. Passed out, woke up. Burning up. 24th onset. 08Oct2021, anxiety. Low dose of beta blockers. 11Oct2021 she couldn't take it anymore. Sinus arrhythmia. Wanted to be admitted. Eventually, discharged her. Appointment with cardiologist. Had two past, stress test. Three visits. She didn't even know if it was her heartbeat that was causing. She put her hand on her heartbeat and she know what it feels like. Buzzing. Tachy even though it wasn't tachy. Comes out of your chest. Now that time had passed she was slowly getting back to normal. She did have AV Block. Prescribed dose. Short episode of three beats. Lower dose, sensitive to meds. Symptoms she had Friday morning. Fresh pack of birth control. Got off birth control. Not premenopausal, she knew that for sue. Investigate that pharmacy. Two or three more forms. Makes you wonder. Boom on Friday she was in a dark place. Persisted finally. It affected her. More than dose. She was not immune-compromised; she broke the rules. Follow up with the cardiologist. she went to the OB, told her everything under the moon you can think up. Not premenopausal after bloodwork. Ovulation stage. It was a horrible period. She wasn't hot and sweaty. Refreshing. She didn't think she had ever passed out. It was just odd. Wait two weeks. It was honestly COVID. Being sick and miserable. She didn't really have a support system unfortunately. Got it back in Sep21. Other people come with weird symptoms. After a few months they get better. More Pfizer. She waited from 24Sep2021 till 11Oct2021 to go to the ER. She did question her cardiologist about it she did say she felt that the blood work and the x-ray she didn't see it as inflammation. She wanted to feel better. Still experiencing chest pain and pressure. She was afraid to get vaccine. She was afraid to get MODERNA. Caller (patient) was not sure what happened to her, something did and has been to many doctor visits since thinking that she was going into early menopause and she went to OB checked out and she was not in early menopause. Stated she had sweats and higher heart rate and whatever that was eliminated. Stated the vaccine was the only other thing. Stated she had been to so many doctor offices and still had to see neurologist and others. Stated she was getting better and she had a suspicion something was done at the pharmacy. With the 1st 2 vaccine she had mild fever, chills and ached and that stopped, and everything was fine in early Jan2021, no issue or problems. Stated she had soreness with whole cycle opposed to the last week and she started taking Beta blockers too and thought that so she stopped the birth control that gave soreness, every day she took Advil and she stopped it as well and doesn't think that was related to that may have been body getting older and OB said lot of people come in with messed up cycles. Had been to cardiology multiple times and has follow up in a few months. Her heart rate went up 1.5 years before and didn't get it addressed because of Covid and started beta blockers for higher heart rate due to stress. She got heart palpitations and sweats, heart rate 99 in blood pressure (BP) cuff and lower when not paying attention so started small dose beta blocker for some relief and did help. Caller stated she had a lot of stress and anxiety and with her 1st 2 doses in Jan2021 she had side effects for 2 days and they went away, just stopped and was fine and everything was great. Stated she was considered obese and had no other underlying issues, hyperthyroid was stress induced but that disappeared with beta blocker, her hair was still thin but magically cured and she thought it was wrong and inaccurate and she didn't have insurance at the time. She got insurance and was put on T4 drugs subclinical TSH high and T3 T4 low but in range. States on LEVOXYL and hair grew back and skin is normal after 1 month and 3 months her hair is thicker and back and then told to stop taking as too high of a dose and she had insomnia but has hair, she tries to go back and forth, she was still under 10 and has thinner hair. Stated the bloodwork TSH lower than stress induced hyperthyroid and total T4 really high and has never happened before. Stated she has been tested 2 times since she started the beta blocker and the vaccine and doesn't think that would change her thyroid it would be the beta blocker. Stated they gave her the beta blocker for hyper to slow it down so she didn't have too much thyroid. Stated she wishes she had naturally done a decrease for her heartrate because she was sick, weak, foggy and feels dumb and stupid. Stated they switched her beta blocker and she had less side effects but it didn't block her anxiety as well, that stress lowers immunity and the reason she wanted the vaccine was to go out to dinner and she was close to her 8-month vaccine mark. On 21Sep2021 she went to (withheld) 2 days before it was approved and signed papers saying she was immunocompromised and wasn't and knows that was wrong and they gave her an intrusive questionnaire and she didn't have to divulge information about her health and the tech said she didn't have to sign or fill out, she could tell she wasn't happy about her getting the vaccine and she isn't immunocompromised but she wanted to feel safe before her birthday. She said she was keeping the paperwork and put it in her purse, she was not required to complete it and got a lot of backlash for it and told the tech they had been giving shots a long time. She overheard them talking at the window and the pharmacist said I know she signed the papers and you have to give it and she was still having issues with her giving the vaccine. All those red flags, she didn't feel like she should be getting the vaccine, a gut feeling she should change her mind and cancel and didn't and wishes she had. She went into the room and looked at the vaccine and she knows it's supposed to be off white and it looked different and may have been her nervousness and feeling like it's not right. It was administered at 6:30pm and she went home like the 1st time and had a light fever and was a little sleepy this time and didn't mind, she slept a 3-hour nap, she was grateful for that she doesn't sleep that long. She got chills hot and cold not as bad and Wed felt crappy. Thursday the fever was done and she felt perfectly normal like the 1st time and she thought she was back to where she should. Something happened Friday morning, she woke up and was in a pool of sweat not similar to the vaccine and was drenched in sweat, she was still kind of asleep but aware and was like fighting it and her head was left and right and she passed out and woke up and doesn't know what time she woke up at noon. Still having that sweat all over and her heart rate wasn't being controlled like it had been since Jan2021 and the same dose for several months, it's the 2nd beta blocker Atenolol 37.5mg, before that it was half as she wanted to take as little as possible. Medication affects her different, less works so why take more she gets less side effects and her doctor gave her permission, he prescribed 50 mg once a day and said she could take half. Information provided by caller is discrepant. She had an echo when she went to a sleep pulmonologist and he sked why she is on beta blocker and she said for stress and heart palpitations and sweats at night but they were not the same after the booster. She would wake up from those sweats and would go back to normal and be fine, no hot sensation or like she was on fire. Everyone said it was hot flashes, premenopause and they couldn't do anything about hot flashes. Something happened and pulmonology did an echo before it all happened and it was perfect, nothing showing at all on that or EKG. She doesn't sleep a lot with stress with her crazy family. She got the vaccine Tuesday and Wed and Thursday was fine and Friday was burning up and heart rates went in the 90's and wondered why since she takes a beta blocker and had no control of her heart rate all of a sudden. Caller called her pharmacy and asked if anyone else had a weird reaction from the same vial and was told no one had a reaction, she did for some reason and it was the entire day her body temperature was 97.8 but she felt completely hot and she couldn't cool down, she was extremely nauseous and has a fan on her and she didn't think to take 50 she was on 37.5. Her heart rate was in the 90's when she wakes up and thank goodness she was on a beta blocker or it would be way over what it is. She was sweating and nauseous and had Promethazine to take as needed with anxiety and IBS and she was taking more often that she would have like, it caused dehydration and she was drinking fluids like crazy non stop to stay hydrated. Was told it lasts 2 weeks in the system and to give it 2 weeks and she was miserable with mental breakdowns, crying hysterically miserable about why her heart rate keeps going up. Everyday it's like clockwork then down to the 80's but still feels sick and don't know why. She couldn't take it anymore and took 50 mg and felt better and didn't wake up as bad and her heart rate went down for 2 glorious days then next day right back up, it's not anxiety she knows what that feels like this was heartrate just going up no reason and don't know why. It has gotten better it's hard to control it, she has to avoid stress, doesn't drink a lot of caffeine, she stopped that, reduced sugar intake, hasn't lost weight with reduced food intake as she lost her appetite. Each day she is sweating so much it's hard to get mobile or move or anything, she felt immobilized. She saw her primary and was tired and couldn't communicate that she took 50mg and he ran out of the room so quick so she went to the ER something was wrong. They did EKG and blood and didn't examine her physically but it's in the paperwork with wrong symptoms and it was her 1st dose. Had an EKG that had sinus arrhythmia. She was stupid to go to the ER that day, she took more than 50 that day and it didn't work in a span of 6 hours she took 50 at night and took 2 quarter doses for total of 75mg and went to the ER and it's cold there so that helped and she was laying down and tired and out of it. She had a slight arrhythmia, not a big deal she was told. She was admitted and they kept coming and saying do you see normal heart rate and yes she because she took 75mg of the blocker of it wouldn't be normal. Now it has stopped but she had a weird beat and it wasn't a hand on the chest feeling laying there it was like static over her heart buzzing and buzzing and she can't read, watch TV or anything the heart rate is so annoying and tried elevating on pillows. She hasn't had that sensation in a long time. It was very annoying and didn't feel normal. ER asked her if she wanted to be admitted and she had lost 5 pounds from sweating and she took too long to decide she would have gotten more attention is she had and seen if she had something going on like inflammation with higher heartrate which is common with the vaccine. She found out her sister had it for a day with the 2 vaccines she had inflammation of her heart and it went away after a day, she is a pharmacist specializing in cardiology. Caller went home and suffered with her heart rate back up and felt like complete crap again. Saw a cardiologist and was exhausted miserable nauseous at this point and got a Holter and sent it back and showed AV block, it was a short 3 heartbeats but why on a low dose of beta blocker and she was still buzzing and sweating and in hell every day the same. They want stress tests and was told that more people are aware of their heartbeats but this is something different and they would like her to reduce her beta blocker dose. She discontinued her birth control and her 1st natural period in over 10 years. She has to go back to 37.5mg beta blocker, her heart beat was starting to get lower and go back to where it was and has to stay calm and avoid stress as much as possible and is getting less and less of the off heartbeat From 24Sep2021 at onset into mid Oct2021 starting slowly slowly getting back to normal, she is going back to a lower dose and not going up as much as she expected it to, she is still not able to sleep 1-2 hours a night her body would not let her with the irritating heartrate, hot, mental breakdowns and nighttime she starts crying and is miserable, she still doesn't feel like herself .Had Holter and stress test done same week and is exhausted and still tired and has chest pain, more or a pressure and things are looking up. The beta blocker only works 5-6 hours and heart rate goes up and she can't sleep. She still doesn't feel like herself 100%, cardiology gave all clear, AV block is gone and she stays on lower dose and blood work showing normal all of a sudden after 6 years of her thyroid TSH rising. They had switched to lower estrogen birth control that she stated the same week as the Pfizer vaccine and she stopped it. Caller would like pharmacy looked into, that technician was crazy why she was anal retentive, other people have lied for their 1st shot or about immunocompromised and went to several different pharmacies. She talked to her pharmacist and was on a dose of Vitamin D and had crystals in her urine. Her TSH is back to where it was and low blood pressure and high heartrate. Caller wanted to report that she thinks the pharmacy did something to her injection for the tech to be so anal retentive and there is always extra in the vial and someone said she probably sprinkled more in her injection and it was too much in there. She was probably thinking, bitch you are lying about being immunocompromised and it won't hurt you if you are taking autoimmune drugs it won't matter. Everything had to be a process of elimination. She felt like she tampered with her injection for her to have this reaction after, she really felt she did something, something was off her gut said not to with how she was acting and talking to her and about her but she can't prove it or do anything. She really had 100% no issue with the vaccine. She had a little bit of chest pain, more pressure and irritating heart beat that would be sign of inflammation, myocarditis that to her personally is what she feels she had. She wishes she had gone to ER earlier and not suffered, she is foggy and doesn't feel like herself. She couldn't take beta blockers before stress test and was normal, she was told her blood pressure was really low at 100/72 and heart rate way too high. ER blood work was normal and x-ray normal. She took a double dose and couldn't sleep more than an hour a night and she blames the thyroid medication. Clarified she got the Pfizer Covid vaccine doses and booster. When it comes time for the next one is she going to risk it and get sick again and is she eve going to feel herself again. Maybe she got inflammation that is lasting a really long time.

The fever was not that high but high enough. the pt was in bed for 2 days. The pt broke out in rash. The pt usually get a rash with any kind of virus. This was not surprising to her. However, the rash this time around was a lot stronger. It was all over her abdomen and her back. that went away In a few days the pt felt fine, and the fever went down. A week later, the pt noticed the red mark growing on my forearm. It was a red little circle. It looked like something could burst. It had a texture. It formed a scab because it was open.  Few days later, the pt noticed it on her other forearm. The circle on her other forename was super red! Bright Bright Bright red!  It had a little white center. It's dark now. It seemed like blood underneath the surface of her skin. it looked like a blood vessel that maybe like swelled under the surface of her skin. Then the pt noticed her fingertip became all blue from her knuckle up to her index finger. It was swollen and bruised. It went away in two hours. She was trying to see if she closed her fingers in something. the pt couldn't remember anything. The same thing happened to her ring finger. the pt ring finger was bluer than the index finger. It was swollen and bruised. It hurts a little, but it didn't go away. This happened for six hours ago it's still there it hasn't gone away. The pt spoke to her nurse practitioner she said there's some sort of inflammation, but she didn't really tell the pt to do anything. She just told the pt to keep an eye on it. It's scary I hope it goes away. the pt has it right after the vaccine there are different adverse reactions the flu like symptoms were after within 24 hours of the vaccine. Rash within 24 hours.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of drug-induced liver injury. Clinical course and discussion: A 61-year-old female with a known history of irritable bowel disease and cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness, body aches, dry heaving, and a low-grade temperature of 99.9 Fahrenheit. The patient received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine nine days before the start of symptoms. She was noted to have conjunctival icterus, mild generalized abdominal tenderness without guarding, or rigidity on physical examination. On admission, the patient's vitals were stable except for tachycardia with a heart rate between 90 and 110 beats/min. Laboratory analysis was remarkable for elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 207 U/L, total bilirubin of 6.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 3.9 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.2 x 10^9 /L, and mildly elevated aspartate transaminase of 37 U/L (Table 1 ""Liver function tests trend"" and Figure 1 ""Graphs showing liver function test trends""). Abdominal ultrasound showed increased echogenicity within the liver compatible with fatty infiltrates, and common duct diameter was measured to be 6 mm. At the same time, CT of the abdomen with contrast showed no acute abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on empiric antibiotics for presumed cholangitis. Gastroenterology consultation was obtained. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography without contrast showed no filling defect within the biliary duct, status post cholecystectomy, bile duct diameter within a normal range, and unremarkable liver. The patient remained afebrile, WBC trended down, and abdominal pain improved over the course of the hospital stay. Given these findings, infectious disease specialist recommended discontinuing antibiotics. Antibodies to liver/kidney microsomal type 1, smooth muscle, anti-mitochondrial, alpha-1 antitrypsin came back negative, and, additionally, ceruloplasmin, antinuclear antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and viral serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C came back negative (Table 2 ""Immunologic and infectious work-up for liver disease""). Liver biopsy showed minimal pallor suggesting slight edema along with scattered inflammatory cells consisting of small lymphocytes, scattered polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and few eosinophils, no evidence of florid duct lesion on interface hepatitis, and no evidence of fibrosis on trichrome and reticulin stain. Given that all work-up for infection, autoimmune diseases, and any obstruction came back negative, the patient's clinical picture and laboratory findings were attributed as a liver injury due to the COVID-19 vaccine. Her liver function levels continued to trend down, and she was discharged from the hospital after a week of hospitalization. On the patient's follow-up with a gastroenterologist, abdominal pain was resolved, and her liver function test values normalized (Table 1 and Figure 1). In this case, the review of medications and history did not reveal any other reason for hepatotoxicity. She also denied the use of any over-the-counter medications or supplements. Although it is rare with vaccination, the COVID-19 vaccine is likely the cause of hepatotoxicity in our patient based on a diagnosis of exclusion. In this case, the patient had a cholestatic pattern with elevated ALP and bilirubin with mild elevation in the transaminases. This patient has underlying fatty liver disease. It is unclear if that was a likely risk factor for hepatotoxicity in this case. Hepatotoxicity can occur with vaccines, even though it is more common with prescription and nonprescription drugs. So, the clinician should be watchful in patients showing clinical signs and symptoms after a vaccine. In summary, we presented a case of liver injury after the COVID-19 vaccine. We attributed the cause of liver injury to the COVID-19 vaccine, given no other cause in our patient after extensive work-up. There are reports of drug-induced liver injury and abnormal liver function analysis from the spontaneous reports from patients who received Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The purpose of this manuscript is to raise awareness of potential side effects; it should not alter the recommendation of healthcare providers regarding vaccinations.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information provided a contributory role of BNT162B2 to the event liver injury cannot be fully excluded. Underlying fatty liver may also be contributory. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,,,Y,,,,Y,01/01/2021,01/01/2021,0,"Test Date: 20180406;

The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: pulmonary function test: nothing wrong with her lungs; urine analysis: unknown results. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of food poisoning, dehydration, hypersensitivity, cough, erythema, hallucination, dyspnoea. Clinical course: On 24Apr2021 or 25Apr2021 the patient had food poisoning and have had it before in the ER highly dehydrated. That Saturday night they took the patient to the hospital and they wanted to keep her overnight, and while she in the holding room she apparently went into an allergic whatever and they gave her Benadryl. The patient had a cough, and her hands from fingertips were blood red both hands turning red up to the wrist. Next day about 4pm the patient had another attack and came in and did the same thing, but this one was worse she could hardly breathe and was put on breathing machines. When she left the hospital they just said allergy period, and since then been to allergy doctors and pulmonary doctors. Nobody specified what she was allergic to. The patient stated the booster shot is out and she firmly believed those two shots she got attacked her system and She became allergic. Every doctor she'd been to says the length of time from shots to hospital, no it wasn't that. She believed it attacked her system and had had weird things going on for 3 or 4 days; her ears rang and had eye problems for a few days and coughing. She also had a problem with vascular on one leg it's swelling and is usually very healthy. Caller states doctors said it's not the vaccine. Per her doctor, her experience after the two vaccines she received was not an allergic reaction. The patient was admitted to the MICU from 24Apr2021-27Apr2021. She had diarrhea for hours on morning 24Apr2021. Only had one episode when she got to the hospital. She had not been sick. It has subsided. States she has only been sick twice with this episode. She only had throwing up once. Think she had two slightly at home. Did not throw up at the hospital. Year before had food poisoning very bad. She has episodes of highly dehydrated. Has had this before. It cleared up in between all. Dehydration is when everything else started. Allergic reaction maybe started when she was moved to the MICU from the ER on the 25Apr2021 (as reported) by 01:00-02:00. Clarifies her allergic experience as the cough and her fingers and hands turning blood red. First cough episode wasn't bad. She was asked to give a urine sample in the hospital. She used the wipes in the little packet to clean herself with. Wasn't about maybe 3-4 minutes when the reaction started. Was told she could have been allergic to that little wipe or towelette. But the patient doesn't think she's allergic to that. Blood red fingertips and hands: Looked like blood. It was turning red and it came up on one hand as far as her wrists. Came to the other hand just above the tops of her fingers. Was given Benadryl in her IV and an Epi Pen. After these medications, the symptoms began to disappear. Next day, doesn't know what time, but in the afternoon she had another attack. It was worse. Second allergic reaction happened on 25Apr2021. Same attack. Was coughing and could hardly breathe. It was attacking her lungs. There is nothing wrong with her lungs. Her pulmonary doctor said she's fine. She is on allergy medication, not Benadryl to prevent her from having an attack again. Has had all these kinds of tests done and they can't find out what it is. Ringing in ears started when she had all these crazy things happening to her system. Right now, they are better today than they were. It was a little humming sound and it lasted maybe 2-3 days. Had Eye problems in Sep2021. Saw her eye doctor in Nov2021. Her eyes are back to where they usually are. Had a cough, and breathing problems. That happened and stayed with her even when she left the hospital. If she walked too much, had difficulty breathing. Had the inhalers. Then difficulty swallowing. Has a problem with swallowing food down. Whatever it is that you swallow with, hers has shrunk. She can have it expanded some but doctor doesn't want to put her in hospital and do it unless its' absolutely necessary. If she eats something too big, and tries to swallow, it sticks and she chokes on it. From the time of Jul2021-Aug2021, had all these crazy things happen to her, like the last time the vasculature on her leg. Appointment for her leg is 22Mar2022. Left leg, foot, and ankle swell up. Right one does it periodically. Right now is wearing compression stockings until she can get X-rays to find out what's wrong. Began after her COVID-19 Vaccines since leaving the hospital.

On an unknown date, the patient developed a non-serious migraine headache for a day and a half/ felt like my head exploded/ felt congested (migraine), eyes were heavy (asthenopia), was very unwell (malaise), had a fever (pyrexia) and feel warm (feeling hot) [unknown latency] following the administration of vaccine.

Then, about six and a half weeks after each of those flu vaccines, I had a urinary tract infection. I would like to know the exact ingredients in these flu vaccines and what has changed in them that may be causing me to have a urinary tract infection six and a half weeks after the vaccines. I believe something since 2019 is causing my problems. I have been consistent with getting flu shots because of my travels. In November of 2019, I got my ever first in my life urinary tract infection. My gynecologist said that I was lucky. I was almost 70 years old. I was traveling around that time, so I thought that maybe I was not drinking enough water or I was not having regular bathroom visits. Then in 2020, I was not going anywhere. I was at home and I again had a urinary tract infection in November. This year 2021, the same story. I had a urinary tract infection on 12Nov2021. It (urinary tract infection) is always six and a half weeks after I have the flu shot. Now, I am drawing a connection that it must be something from the flu shot that is causing this. It might be from something that has been added in 2019. My concern is the consistent urinary tract infection (each November). Each time I had urinalysis and it came back negative. I did not do one (urinalysis) in 2019. I did a urinalysis in 2020 and 2021 and the urinalysis came back negative. Something is giving me this urinary tract infection without any reason. This year, I was quite sick for three days following my FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE QUADRIVALENT injection on 27Sep2021. I had a migraine headache for a day and a half. I do get migraines but the headache on other side is rare and then it went behind. It was strange. On the third day, it felt like my head exploded, my eyes were heavy, and I was very unwell. The fourth strain in the FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE QUADRIVALENT may be too much for me. The fourth strain might have been responsible for the symptoms that I had. I felt like I had a fever and I felt congested, but it was all in my head. So, something is quite serious for me. I always have a reaction after a flu shot like I feel warm and do not feel so well but this time was worse. I know a lot of things have formaldehyde and that can also cause some liver problems. The pharmacy records only went back three years, so I do not know which flu vaccine I had in 2018. I will be seeing my doctor in two weeks and I would like to have information to be able to discuss with my doctor. I may try the FLUZONE STANDARD DOSE next year.

The patient's concurrent conditions included asthma. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's historical vaccine included Fluad vaccine (unknown if trivalent or quadrivalent) after which the patient had no issues.  On 15-Oct-2021, the patient was vaccinated with Fluad Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine, inactivated influenza virus surface antigen (subunit), egg-derived, mf59; dose: 0.5 ml, anatomical location: left arm and route of administration: intramuscular) for influenza prophylaxis. The batch number reported was 312849, expiration date: 08-Jun-2022.  On the same day, right after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced a sore arm. The patient was afraid that she received a COVID vaccine instead of a flu vaccine because the pharmacy was very busy that day and a lot of people were in the waiting room for a COVID dose.  It was confirmed that lot number provided by her, corresponded to a Fluad lot number.  On 16-Oct-2021, one day after administration of Fluad Quadrivalent, the pain worsened and started to radiate up to her neck above her left collarbone, extending to the side and back. The patient stated that the left side of her head also hurt. She also developed a deep, raspy, dry cough during this time she had never experienced before.  On 17-Oct-2021, the patient states that the symptoms began to lessen.  On 18-Oct-2021, the patient stated that most of the adverse reactions had gone away, but she did experience a sore arm, back pain and pain up the neck. The patient stated that she still had left shoulder and neck pain that extends to the top of the back, and every once in a while, she would experience a ""burst"" where there will be a spot on her collarbone that ""sends a jolt up her neck"". No corrective treatment was given for the reactions.   On the same day, the patient recovered from the events of 'headache', 'dry cough' and 'painful arm'.  On an unspecified date in Oct-2021, the patient was nervous about getting Fluad again.  The outcome of the events of 'nervous' and 'fear' was not reported.  At the time of initial reporting on 27-Oct-2021, the patient had not recovered from the events of 'shoulder pain', 'neck pain' and 'back pain'.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The reporter assessed the case as non-serious.  Company comment: One day after administration of Fluad Quadrivalent, the pain developed pain in arm, neck pain, back pain, headache and dry cough. The events are assessed as possibly related to the Fluad Quadrivalent, due to suggestive time relationship.; Sender's Comments: One day after administration of Fluad Quadrivalent, the pain developed pain in arm, neck pain, back pain, headache and dry cough.

The next day, I called the pharmacy and spoke to the immunizer who said that it leaked out after she took out the syringe and that at least two drops came out. She thinks that more than half went in but can't be sure. She was not sure why it happened. The following day, I called again and spoke to the manager who stated that it is too hard to estimate how many drops are in a full dose of .2mL and that generally they don't give another half shot or full shot to complete the dosage. He suggested that I could get an antibody test, but that they would not cover the cost of that expense.  He said that he was ""pretty sure"" that he got enough of the shot, but he was not present at the time of the administration of the shot.    I called the Health Department and the medical director stated, ?If there is a lower than authorized dose, it would be repeated. It's hard to know how much leaked out so I can't recommend if they should repeat and would defer to the person who administered. The rule of thumb had been if more than half leaked out to repeat but the new guidelines are less clear.  If I had administered and a substantial portion had leaked (even if less than half), I would repeat but I don?t have an understanding of the amount.  For example, if it?s a drop and you repeat, you would then provide a larger than authorized dose.""

1923236,12/04/2021,NY,63.0,63,,M,,"My immune system is not protecting me from infections or allergies, see continuation page I have a history of low IGG values. Back in 2020, my Immunoglobulin G was 550 mg/dL. My IG A was 70 mg/dL. Back in 1996 they performed a bone biopsy, to prove this was genetic.   After getting the booster of J&J, batch 213D21A on Oct 29.2021, I had no symptoms for one week and then I started to get symptoms which I normally get when I am fighting a cold or a worsening of my Celiac disease. The difference, which wasn't apparent at first, was I'm not clearing them. I will go into detail for each:  Two major items are my allergies are not controllable and I'm being attacked by fungus.  1) Fungus infections are not clearing a. On Nov 17 I got Athlete's Foot. In the past I would catch this if I walked in mud in my back yard by the lake. As soon as my feet would start peeling, I would use a tube of Terbinafine cream and a week later they would be better. This time, I did nothing to cause it, and it is not clearing and in fact spreading. It is 2 � weeks now.   b. On Nov 14th I pulled a few hairs from inside my nose, and they got infected, in the past I put Bacitracin on it and expected it would be healed in 2 days, but on Nov 16th it developed into a fungus infection and had an awful smell. I started treating it with Nystatin and Triamcinolone and 2 � weeks later I still have the infection. It still smells if I touch it. c. Around Nov 10th hairs on my chest, back and crotch were hurting. I tried to shave them off and each hair got red and hurt worse. I have been rubbing Nystatin and Triamcinolone on them twice daily since. Never has this gone on more than two days.   2) Pollen Allergies are the worst I have ever had a. I take Flonase 50 mcg twice daily and was also taking Astelin 131 mcg. I was having problems urinating and was wetting my pants and dripping on the floor. I haven't had these issues since I had prostate surgery 15 years ago. Back then I had an obstruction, and any antihistamine would keep me from urinating, as it is a muscle relaxer. So, about 9 months ago I started to use Astelin to clear a sinus infection and keep on taking it. Well, I stopped it on Nov 22nd and the voiding problem disappeared, but now I am now so sensitive to pollen, it is troubling. My eyes are itching, and I can't run a meeting for work without sucking on a Halls drop, because I'm constantly congested. This is not allergy season and if my wife brings home flowers I start sneezing if I get near them. If it is windy or raining, I get so congested I get headaches. When I blow my nose, I get some blood out, in it.  I've been running our home AC fan to filter out her pollen, but it isn't helping. In the 28 years I lived here I have never experienced these problems. 3) Body strain a. When I lay in bed watching TV, or when I wake up in the morning, I can't lean forward, as it really hurts. In fact, if I must sneeze, I scream out and it causes a sharp pain in my lower back. This strain I had for the past three years as our mattress wore out, but I replaced it with a firm, latex mattress back in July. But in the past three weeks the strain is back and stronger. b. Certain muscles to my left arm really hurt for no reason, randomly. I never had that pain before 4) Mouth Infections a. Around Nov 5th, I thought I had a canker sore and treated it with Hydrogen Peroxide 4%, but it didn't clear in the 7 days it normally takes. It may be gone today, but I have another infection on the other side which is still there. I never had anything like this which lasted more than one week.  What I'm so concerned about is it appears to me that my immune system is not working, or it is busy. Medicines are not working, and I am getting worse. I'm getting more fatigued, for no reason. I'm fearing this is Antiboby-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). I want to know if this is from the J&J booster and if at some point my immune system will recover, or do I have to be super careful to avoid any infections as they will kill me?  I think I should never get another booster for Covid-19.",,,,,,,,,N,10/29/2021,11/05/2021,7,,PHM,,"Crestor, Nexium, Flonase, Astelin, Centrim Adult, Topicort, Nystatin & Triamcinolone",None,Celiac,,,2,12/03/2021,,Y,,"Propylene Glycol, Gluten, Cefzil, Sulfa, Pollen, Orange, Sorghum, Latex, blue cheese, sulfites, jalapenos"

I was treated with morphine and several steroid shots and was monitored until I could finally sit up and was released. I visited my PCP the next day and by that time I could walk on a walker and he again gave more steroid shots to help elevate the swelling. This persisted for about a week where I had a hard time walking and was still taking the steroid pills to help make the additional swelling go down.

Fever (102 degrees Fahrenheit) and chills the night after receiving the vaccine (lasted around 6 to 8 hours). I had difficulty sleeping that night. I was uncomfortable and had muscle aches everywhere. I felt dehydrated and  got hungry in the middle of the night so I drank some water and ate two small bowls of Mac and Cheese before taking two tablets of 650mg Tylenol (to lower the fever because it was getting gradually getting higher). The following morning after waking up (I only slept for a few hours), I was sweating (fever was gone) and I got up to go to the bathroom. This is when the ""adverse event"" began.  Adverse Event: As I was standing in the bathroom getting ready to urinate, I started feeling a dizzy and my heart was pounding harder than usual (not faster or slower, but stronger beats). My vision got blurry and I started seeing white stars (white filling up my vision). I then felt this odd hollow, nauseating feeling in my stomach and began feeling too weak to properly focus. I started walking out of the bathroom to call for help and was helped to lay down on a bed. I felt like I was fainting (I have never fainted before but I am pretty certain that must be what it feels like to start to lose consciousness and the ability to move as you begin fainting).  Treatment and Outcome: As I was laying down, I fortunately started feeling like my energy was returning. My vision began reappearing and despite feeling extremely anxious during this incident, I was now feeling a bit more calm as it felt like I was getting better now. My parents where in the process of getting a phone to call ED to get help for the emergency but put that on hold as they helped me sit. I was not sure what had just happened and if I should go to the emergency room. I felt weak, scared, and kept grabbing my chest (I felt like I needed to feel my pulse and breathe deeply). I used Agency to call a doctor for advise on what to do. She mentioned that she believes that I had Orthostatic Hypotension as a result of the vaccine-related fever, being dehydrated, and getting up quickly. She told me that if I continued to feel sick then to go see a doctor in person but she said I didn't have to go to the emergency room now unless I felt like I had to or the incident reoccurs. I've felt weaker than usual since the incident (it's been 3 days since) and also somewhat nervous/anxious that it will occur again. I feel like I am getting a bit more agitated than usual (even when doing regular things like standing up from sitting or walking) and have had a lot of trouble sleeping at night (a bit of insomnia for the past few days).",,,,,,,,,Y,11/30/2021,12/01/2021,1,None but I am planning on seeing a doctor soon to get checked up.,PHM,,None,None,None,,,2,12/04/2021,,Y,,None

Patient became unconscious again and seemed as though she was about to seize so I positioned her on her side. No seizure was actually observed and patient regained consciousness again after about 10 seconds. I instructed that the patient remain on her side till she was stable. At this time store management was onsite taking notes and offering that we call an ambulance, for which both patient and husband declined. An ice pack was placed on the patients back and she remained laying down for another 10 minutes till stabilized. Patient was alert and orientated to person, place, and time and showed proper neurological and muscular function by being able to squeeze both of my hands. I sat her up and provided an orange juice for her to sip on while I had her wait in the observation area for another 30 minutes to ensure she was okay.

She said she was exhausted and went to bed. At 4am she came to our room, seemingly fully awake but talking nonsensically (said ""but does 4 x 78 work??"" several times, talked about her ""coloring books"" and then eventually said ""I just can't do it. Can I just forget about my numbers and snuggle while I fall asleep?""). Needless to say it was rather disturbing. We've never had anything like this with her before. We let her sleep in this morning and when she woke up at 9am, she was again disoriented (looked at my husband and me after she had been awake for a couple of minutes and asked ""but which one is the real mother?""). She didn't seem particularly scared or disturbed, just really out of it. She ate some breakfast and while she is sort of quiet now and complaining only of feeling a little nauseous, she no longer seems disoriented. That said, she's not totally herself. She hasn't asked about school at all which is very unlike her.     I'm mostly just letting you know for reference sake. I trust she will be totally fine in hopefully short order, but this was an unexpected and pretty concerning side effect.     Have you heard of anything like this with this vaccine or any others?

By Tuesday early morning I had began having severe coughing fits that were dry and uncontrollable. I was also short of breath both while moving (going up a flight of stairs) and while sedentary at times and had instances where my heart felt like it was fluttering. My chest/lungs felt like a small child was sitting on them aside from the burning, raspy cough.  I took several cough suppressants to minimize the symptoms but as the coughing fits were keeping me up at night I went to my primary care physician on 10/5/2021. The nurse practitioner and I went over my symptoms and I was diagnosed with severe bronchial spasms with the potential for an asthma diagnosis. Having no issues with breathing previously, I asked that we rule other things out like bronchitis or an infection. The coughing fits continued with cough suppressants not minimizing the symptoms. I was told if I had an upper respiratory infection there was not much that could be done and that I should return in 6-8 weeks if the symptoms persist. On 11/2/2021 I received the second dose of the vaccine (again due to the military mandate and my unit's deadline of being fully vaccinated by 12/2/2021), and experienced the same extreme fatigue. At this point, the symptoms still had not subsided so I scheduled another appointment for 11/19/2021. The nurse practitioner indicated that it could still be an upper respiratory infection, perhaps indigestion (with zero previous issues with indigestion), or if I was not better in a month that we needed to seriously consider asthma and that based on the timing of my symptoms it appeared that the vaccine was the culprit as I had exhibited none of the symptoms prior to these events. I was prescribed an albuterol inhaler to aid in the coughing fits and shortness of breath. We scheduled a follow up visit for mid January to complete the diagnosis. As of 12/5/2021 I still have the symptoms described above. I remain short of breath and even long conversations often put me out of breath despite being previously moderately healthy and fit- per military requirements.

It manifested by a very sharp muscle pain, to the left side of my back. I attributed it to be a muscle strain, however the next day I became very weak. I found myself to have difficulty exerting myself in any degree whatsoever. I happened to pick up an oximeter. I was playing with it that night and it read 85. That night I went to be ER. I was given a blood thinner, Eliquis, and was released the next day. I went off the blood thinners after 6 months. I was diagnosed with DPE/dual pulmonary embolism. I was put on Eliquis on 03/04/2018. The source of the blood clot was my left leg. I was taken off the Eliquis 09/2018. On 03/05/2021 about 9 hours later after the vaccine, I started to have that very sharp pain in my back. The exact same place I felt it 3 years prior of the vaccine. The oximeter was down to 90. I decided to hang tough before I went to the ER. Within 2 hours the pain had gone away the oximeter went up to 96. At 8:00PM on Friday the pain had gone away and the oxygen level was back to normal. On Monday, I called my PCP and I asked him to prescribe blood thinner and I restarted the Eliquis bd on Monday. I continued that until I got my 2nd dose on 03/26/2021. I did not have the symptoms I had after the 1st dose. I had the booster 10/01/2021. I also started Eliquis 2 weeks before the dose, and I did not have the same reaction as the 1st dose.

I'm noticing it's getting increasingly more intense. I plan on going to either a hearing doctor and/or ENT to get checked out further.

No immediate reaction.  9/23/2021: 24 hours after second dose, face and hands break out into significant hives and swelling (almost couldn?t get my rings off my fingers).  9/23 through 10/17/2021: Near daily severe hives, almost all over my body with varying severity depending on location that changed location daily - some days my face was worst, some my legs and feet, some my back and chest and shoulders, some my hands, some my head and neck, etc. Severe itching. Throat itching, difficulty/strange feeling swallowing, feeling of heart burn. Sweaty feet. Swelling in face, throat, hands, and feet varied daily. Got first pack of steroids on 9/25 (methylprednisolone), then progressively got stronger steroids (Prednisone then Dexamethasone) before finally getting some relief starting about 9/30. Stayed on steroids and antihistamine (mostly Benadryl) until symptoms abated enough to stop, which wasn?t until about 10/17/2021.

I then began to improve but the knee pain was persistent so I got some physical therapy.

The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: biopsy lymph gland: (Sep2021) unknown results, notes: Biopsy to her left armpit auxiliary area; blood test: (Sep2021) normal, notes: my blood work is all normal; colonoscopy: (Sep2021) unknown results; endoscopy: (Sep2021) unknown results; magnetic resonance imaging: (Sep2021) unknown results; (Sep2021) unknown results; mammogram: (Sep2021) unknown result, notes: she had a mammogram; ultrasound breast: (Sep2021) unknown result, notes: knows it was her lymph nodes. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pain, pelvic pain.  Clinical information: Consumer stated, she waited like 3-4 weeks till she got her breast ultrasound done and they 'found' (word not clear) one, a swollen 'sign' (Further clarification unknown), so she needed a biopsy of her left side of armpit which was done putting a biomarker and the little 'metal chip' in it (Further clarification unknown), but since she got the vaccine she have been sick non-stop. Most days she just get severe body ache all over. She could not move, it just hurts too bad, fatigue it feels like she have the 'slo-mo' phase with no energy just like bad fatigue, body ache. What's really bothering me was she was having this really severe (incomplete sentence), she could not move her arms right now but it's like this pain in her armpit but there was no swollen lymph nodes right now, they just 'stopped' but this is sharp shooting pain that radiates her armpit into her back and her neck. Okay, her doctor said, it was lymphoma (Consumer was unsure, hence not captured as event), somehow she had bad symptoms, she just feel like her whole body crashed, her whole health crashed, they kept thinking it's lymphoma, they kept doing test she guess all the symptoms was bad at night So, she got this bad rash over her body. She had eczema but normally it's not this bad and for some reason it's just spread it up all over. She had her lymph node biopsy the day before her second dose. So, she got the other one in her right arm. Laboratory Test: Consumer stated, she had like 10 different blood draws in last like 2 months since she got the shot. They have been trying to figure out what she had. She could not count how many blood works she have done. Results: Yes, her blood work was all normal everything came back fine which is why they kind of keep testing everything maybe help in finding what's going on. No Prior vaccination (4 weeks), she thought the last time she got a vaccine was when she was 19 years. She got flu shot, that was a long time ago. Treatment in response to adverse event: Consumer stated, At the moment they don't have treatment they have only done testing but they were trying to find out what's going on but at the moment they just continue the pain management just like Ibuprofen and stuff but nothing seems to really help. Ibuprofen didn't helped. She was just done with three pack, she started to do Ibuprofen every day and that's not good (Further clarification unknown). LOT of Ibuprofen: Consumer stated, she didn't have it on her. It was just normal main brand Ibuprofen over the counter. Additional Context: The last vaccine she had on 30Sep2021 and the first she had on 09Sep2021. Stated since having the Pfizer vaccine her whole health had been going down and she had been in and out with doctors since Sep and has had every blood draw and MRIs, abdominal and pelvic MRIs, and a colonoscopy and endoscopy and had a lymph node biopsy to her left armpit auxiliary area. Stated she got the Pfizer Covid vaccine 1st dose on 09Sep2021 with lot FC3184 on her left side and then got the 2nd dose on 30Sep2021 with lot 301358A to her right arm; stated her patient card has no expiry dates or NDC numbers written on it. She got the 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine and that one she did not feel too too bad with and had the normal aches and had uterine cramping for 12 days and she started spotting 3 days after; stated after that she had her time of the month and felt it was a rough one and then time went on. Stated with her cycle, she has the issue of passing clots that were the size of her palm and cramps where she couldn't move and she would not know if this was ongoing because her period ended and it lasted and she was still having pelvic pain; stated the pelvic pain was ongoing and it kind of like was the same but depends. She had endometriosis and knows this pain was common with her cycles and had trouble and had surgery for it and it got better and then she got the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Stated her first period after the pain she had in-between and the cycle of spotting after the 1st period she noticed she was passing clots that were a little bigger than normal clots and they were clots the size of her palm. She Could not remember the dates of the testing she had but had the lymph node biopsy after her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine; stated after the 1st dose of the vaccine she had a breast ultrasound and knows it was her lymph nodes and thought since it had been two weeks since her vaccine that was enough to be done but thought it was from the vaccine; states they put metal tips in to mark it for swollen lymph nodes due to history of breast cancer; caller clarified to state she does not have a history of breast cancer and they did the auxiliary lymph node biopsy in her left armpit and thought it was this and she had a mammogram because her mother had breast cancer and they were worried about that so she saw an OB GYN and said she needed a breast ultrasound and needed a biopsy but this was a side effect of the vaccine. Stated she was swollen on her left side from the lymph node biopsy. Caller stated she did not want the vaccine at all but due to her child, she got it; stated she was a birth mom and placed her daughter for adoption and sees her pretty often but was not able to see her as much and the adoptive mom called to let the caller know she will not be able to see the child if she was not able to get vaccinated so it forced her to get vaccinated; caller stated she has infertility issues and issues with her reproductive system and seeing her daughter was more important so she got the vaccine. She had the history of endometriosis and that was diagnosed maybe two years ago so they diagnosed her with endometriosis three months after giving birth maybe two years ago and had the second surgery for it back in Feb2021. After that the pain was not as bad and was managed nicely. The day before the lockdown occurred and wanted to say this was 18Mar2020 before the shutdown and from the first surgery to the next year the tube had done that thing. Stated more people were having long term side effects. Her Primary care physician thought she had lymphoma because of the low grade fever, body pain and swollen lymph nodes and feeling like crap; stated it all came back negative and every blood test and everything was fine and they did a chest Xray last week and can't come up with any answers and she did not know it was vaccine related but this happened after the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated she was wondering if anything can be done with her symptoms and she talked to her doctor and was crying because she hurt really bad and had bad pain in her neck and armpits and in her neck and her doctor was running out of resources and test and answers he could not give to her and states she can't keep taking Ibuprofen and it was bad for the liver and asks if anything can be done for her symptoms; caller aware Pfizer not able to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations. She did not have the Ibuprofen with her at this time and the Ibuprofen was the normal dosage or strength and thinks it was 200mg and is that the normal dose and she had no lot number, expiry date or other information to provide for the Ibuprofen. Stated she did not know if the symptoms would last the rest of her life or if it was something she can tolerate and thought she would reach out to Pfizer to see if there was any chance her symptoms were related. Stated also on her list was armpit pain and she had pain in her fingertips and the fingertips lost feeling and went numb and it was a loss of not a cold feeling but kind of like numb in the finger pads and almost in both pinkies she lost feeling in them and the rest of her pads of her fingers lost sensation and she can't feel everything and guesses her fingers were numb all the way down.

A few days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on January 7, 2021, I experienced the same heavy bleeding and clotting. I made an urgent appointment with my OB/GYN on January 14, 2021 and was started on hormone therapy (Megace) to control the bleeding. At the time, I did not connect the bleeding with the vaccine.

After multiple attempts, I was unable to wean from the Megace without experiencing heavy bleeding.  I underwent an endometrial ablation on August 12, 2021.  Samples of uterine tissue were sent to pathology at that time, and cancer was not detected and was ruled out as a reason for the bleeding.

1924536,12/06/2021,NY,25.0,25,,F,,"11 days after receiving the booster shot, I woke up with extreme itchiness on my head and behind ears. They were very red. Later throughout the day, it spread to my entire body and I was covered in huge hives that became worse upon scratching or touching my skin. It was unbearable and benadryl did not help. I went to urgent care and they said my throat was clear--I was advised to take benadryl and see an allergist. The hives at this point were on my elbows, stomach, breasts, everywhere. My feet and hands were swollen and physically hurt. I could not walk properly. This continues every single day. I have seen 2 allergists who confirmed I am not allergic to anything and this was not caused by food or any product I used. They both believed this could have been caused by the vaccine and recommended over the counter antihistamines. I have been taking 4x the normal daily dose and still experience extreme itchiness. Nothing gives me relief--every day I take two oatmeal baths, apply topical cortisone, and take the antihistamines. This is very unbearable and difficult to experience. Please, please look into this and do what you can to inform the public and find a solution for those suffering.

He did not recommend pinning it back together, he recommended a partial shoulder replacement because there could be other issues from it. He gave me a sling for my shoulder.

Patient is an 84 year old male, vaccinated against COVID-19, with a history of valvular and ischemic heart disease who was initially diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia on September 30. He presented to the hospital on October 13 with worsening shortness of breath. Initial workup was consistent with coronary ischemia and acute heart failure in addition to COVID-19 infection. He was admitted to the hospital and treated for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and COVID-19. Over the course of the first night of his hospitalization the patient developed rapidly worsening gas exchange and was transferred to the ICU. Point of care echocardiography revealed markedly abnormal LV systolic function consistent with an acute MI and systolic heart failure.

It was inadvertently diluted with sterile water diluent instead of the included part two liquid vial.  This dose was deemed invalid and was repeated on 11/29/2021  The root cause of this error is due to the packaging by manufacturer.  Unlike all other vaccines, this two part vaccine must be mixed together in order to be effective.  It is not a sterile water diluent like our other vaccines.   Other vaccines packaged this way come as 10 vials in a box = 10 doses.  Menveo is 5 vials each of the liquid and powder therefore only 5 doses.  The two vials do not come ""attached"" in any way.  GSK knows this is an issue and therefore has created bands that we can pair the vials to each other after opening.  In a busy clinic, or new staff when the box is opened its easy for staff to pull just one vial - if its the powdered vial - reconstituting with sterile water diluent like other powedered vaccines is a common error.  If the liquid vial is pulled, its easy to administer just this liquid without mixing.    When this happens, its difficult to trace to one patient therefore often the entire 5 doses need to be tracked and revaccinated since its difficult to know who may have received the correct dose vs incorrect.   In this instance an inexperienced MA administered the powder only, diluted with water to a total of 4 patients before the error was discovered.      Recommended packaging change so that it is very clear that its a two part vaccine , perhaps a peel pack with the two vials together or apply the band before packaging instead of having the end user apply the band.  Better yet. similar to solumedrol vials - its one vial with two chambers, that when the lid is pushed down, it pushes the rubber stopper and the two parts mix together.

My son and I have occasional flares, and it looked similar. She said it was a bit sore, and itchy (we told her not to scratch or rub it).  I did not call the pediatrician right away, as I noticed it the evening before a holiday weekend. Decided to treat it with Hydrocortisone and Benadryl, which I had on hand and call on Monday if it hadn't gotten better or worsened, so we could see about getting a prescription. Over the weekend, a scattering of small spots popped up along her ribcage, under her left armpit, aligned with the spot on her back, and the spot on her back became more irritated (raised and bumpy). Called the pediatrician on Monday morning, 11/29, and was able to get her in right away. Her usual pediatrician is was not available so we saw another doctor. He checked the spots and immediately identified them as shingles. It had not occurred to me that it could be shingles, as patient received her Varicella vaccine doses on 02/28/2012 and 11/12/2015, and has never exhibited any Chicken Pox symptoms. Doctor said since she was already five days from the spots appearing, and they had not opened/bled, we did not need to treat with a prescription. He recommended we treat with Calamine, Benadryl and Ibuprofen. It is not causing ongoing pain, but will cause a quick burst of pain if the shingles are  accidentally pushed or rubbed against. As of today, the rash has gone down significantly. The spots on her ribcage are very small (they almost look like little chicken pox now) and the spot on her back has reduced by about half.  Patient had an appointment for her second vaccine dose on 12/1. Doctor advised we keep the appointment, as it was seven days after her symptoms appeared.

I got pregnant that cycle-my first pregnancy. My due date would have been November 13, 2021. At week 5, shortly after I discovered I was pregnant, I began bleeding slightly. At the hospital, after taking an ultrasound they diagnosed me with an angular pregnancy--in other words, the embryo had implanted on the very edge of the uterus. I was advised that this put me at high risk of early miscarriage. I didn't miscarry, and the pregnancy seemed to be going normally for some weeks. At week 15, however, an early anatomy scan revealed severe IUGR-the baby was measuring two weeks behind. Further investigation revealed that the cause was a placenta that seemed never to have formed correctly. By week 25, we were told that the baby was dying, would not survive delivery at that birth weight, and that continuing the pregnancy  was putting me at high risk of complications. Based on this, we chose a medical abortion at 26 weeks. I delivered stillborn; the baby weighed 380 grams, a weight appropriate to 21 weeks.  Doctors do not know exactly what caused the IUGR. But as I tested negative for blood clotting disorders, they said the likeliest culprit is the angular pregnancy. I was also scanned to see if there were any anomalies in my uterine shape to make me more prone to poor embryo implantation, and the test came back normal. Given that I was vaccinated only a week or two before implantation would have occurred, I thought it was at least worth considering if there was a connection.  I was vaccinated in another country. I only received one dose of the vaccine, as I had recovered from  COVID in March 2020 (I had a mild case, with no lingering symptoms).

After receiving the 2nd dose these headaches have thus continued and are worse. To this day these headaches continue. I delayed to report this adverse event as I hoped they would subside and go away however they are more nagging and bothersome everyday. They are not completely debilitating where I can't function and live life daily however some days they require me to take Excedrin or Motrin to help relieve them to no avail. I historically have never had a history of headaches or migraines. I have otherwise been healthy and there's no added stress or health issues in my life that I can point back to other than this vaccine that correlate to my daily headaches. The headaches start in the morning and progressively get worse as the day goes on in the evening. Some days they are more nagging. The headache hurts around the crown of my head and it's nagging. They don't go away and this makes me very irritable on some days where I can get short tempered with people and also limit my full attention to my work or studies without trying hard to focus. I have not seen a physician about my headaches yet, but I am planning to as they are becoming more of a nuisance. I'd hate to learn that I may have to begin other medical therapies as a result as I am otherwise healthy with no conditions prior.  My arm did hurt after taking the vaccine but nowhere near the level of soreness as the first vaccine. I truly help these headaches go away soon though I am discouraged as it's been 3 months since my second dose.

Additional Information: It was reported that, the reporter was calling about the Pfizer booster shot. She was supposed to get the booster on 27Oct2021. Her last Pfizer vaccine was on the 24Mar2021, which according to her is about a 6-month period. She got struck by a car (she also referred to it as a terrible accident) and ended up in the withheld emergency room instead of the withheld hospital to get her booster shot. She ended up getting a fractured left elbow which she had to get surgery on 08Nov2021. She also has a weakened right leg that she had annoyance from ""to do with the sacrum area"". She says she said getting evaluated and probably won't get to a doctor until Feb because they're so busy. She doesn't know if she should get the booster shot at this time and yet she felt like she was overdue for it but she felt like she has plenty going on with these other things. She mentioned she did not really have any bad side effects from the other two Pfizer shots. But she did have ""crusting"" (the word was hard to understand and I had the caller repeat it which did not clarify much) of her lips that was ""kind of annoying"". When asked to spell the word she said before, she did not spell it and she said ""but it went away, I did not report it because it went away, it wasn't so terrible you know"". She adds she has to go to physical therapy and then she has to go to another doctor to be evaluated for her right leg which is weaker than before. She mentions she will not be in crowds and she doesn't have family so she'll be alone for Thanksgiving. Caller wanted to know if the booster shot is the same as the initial Pfizer shot, is it the same strength/ingredients. Caller wanted to know if she can take the booster right now with everything going on in her life.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Additional information: Patient, reporting on Ibrance and who explains she was taking the product when she took at the second of the Covid shots and the second shot caused huge numbers. Patient clarifies that this means that the first 3 weeks after the Covid second shot did not ring well with the Ibrance and caused her to have multiple migraines. She was having a minimum of 3 each day and that went on for 6 weeks. It has slowly gone back to one a day at this point. The patient stated she wants to report his and is calling to renew her Ibrance refill. The patient explains she tore off the information she needed from the package and threw the box away. She confirms that the migraines started immediately after the second dose. Also, she got the second shot on the same day she started the Ibrance cycle. The patient does not know the exact date but this was several months ago. Patient doesn't have her vaccine card available and has no date, NDC, Lot, or Expiry to provide. It was confirmed the product was the Pfizer Covid vaccine. It was explained that they were continuing, the migraines. She doesn't have a problem with the migraine and the Ibrance normally but with the second shot she had the problem. The patient described them as electronic instead pain and they were also throwing her balance off; she would have imbalances out of the blue. She went to the neurologist and has recently started on a new medication for people that have a brain dysfunction as treatment for this, maybe that is helping. She has to build up with the product but it is scary to be on this type of medication.

Yes, that's the booster shot actually it's (incomplete sentence), so far, he got like 3 shot and he have the side effect. He was getting the rash and hives. He can explain it more so, he got the vaccine in Apr, his second shot was 21Apr and around Sep and Oct he started having hives, actually minor but it was getting more and more every day, by that time he called doctor and then he started taking antihistamine in the medicines to suppress the hives and hives were coming like every night almost every day if he don't take the antihistamine 'it usually goes fast and takes time to go away' (Not clarified over the call) so he started taking every day and then he took the booster shot a couple weeks ago without knowing (incomplete sentence) it's actually 18Nov and he didn't know the hives could be related to the COVID Vaccine but he took the booster shot then the hives became so much severe. When paraphrased the concern, consumer stated, ""So I am suspecting it could be related to COVID Vaccine through Pfizer vaccine. he found a website and there were lot of people discussing the same thing (Further clarification unknown, hence split case was not made). So, he just wanted to report hoping this can 'arise' some awareness."" Other medical conditions: Consumer stated, ""No, I never had allergic reaction before, like prior to COVID Vaccine (Further clarification unknown)."" Treatment in response to adverse event: Consumer stated, ""Zyrtec, I think it is a major brand for the antihistamine. Dose of Zyrtec: Consumer stated, ""I am taking 5 mg daily. I have something that I want to explain, so it helps me for the hives but at the same time Zyrtec makes me drowsy so, I tried another antihistamine which is called Allegra but that was not effective, so I change back to Zyrtec, so Zyrtec seems like it is more effective."" Time of vaccination: Consumer stated, ""The first shot I got in morning maybe between 10 or 11am. The 2nd shot was about the similar time like 11 or 10am.

Relevant laboratory tests and procedures are available in the appropriate section. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pain, blood glucose decreased, dizziness, fatigue.  Additional Information: She was calling about the covid 19 Vaccine. She got her first vaccine on 04Mar2021. Her arm had been sore before the vaccine that was because of muscle pain. However when she got the vaccine she felt the pain move up from left arm into neck and into the head. She has had headaches off and on, so she is not sure if that was caused by the vaccine. There's still pain in the left arm. She was telling her therapist about this, and her therapist suggested that she call and so she is calling to report this. Her First Dose was on 04Mar2021 at 2PM. Caller clarifies that the pain she felt moving was a different type of pain experienced than her usual muscle pain. The Pain in the left arm was experienced the same day, right away, when receiving the first dose, the location of the pain then moved up from the left arm to the center of the neck about 2 hours after. This pain then moved up into the head maybe an hour after moving into the neck. It stopped within a week. She has spinal stenosis. Caller also adds that her blood sugar was low on Saturday. She experienced this on 13Mar2021, it was a low blood sugar, she also felt dizzy at that time, but she attributes that to the low blood sugar, this was new for her because she very rarely has low blood sugars. Caller states that her blood sugar on Saturday was 50. The Muscle Pain in the left arm was prior to the vaccine. Caller states that her Husband has Mobility disability and because of that the vaccine was administered while in the car. He is also Blind and uses a cane.

Caller also adds that she has (PNES) Psychogenic Non Epileptic Seizures, she had 2 of those on Sunday, in which she felt dizzy all day on Sunday and yesterday, and today she is fine. PNES was diagnosed 2 years ago. Fatigue: She has had this fatigued for a year, it has been there, she had been really sick last Mar2020, and she did get tested for covid like 8-9 times, but all the tests came out negative. She is trying to figure out her fatigue, explaining that she is looking at her diet. Caller clarifies that after the vaccine there has been a worsening of the fatigue. Her Second dose is scheduled for 25Mar2021 2PM. Covid Vaccine Card: She needs a magnifying glass. Caller explains that the Lot was Handwritten. She thinks the Lot is 57U6206 or 51U62DE. Caller was queried if this is for a Pfizer Vaccine, she confirms Yes and states that it says Pfizer BioNtech on her card. The Expiry is not written. Lot number documented as provided. The Muscle Pain that she had in the Left Arm has not been formally diagnosed but she does have trouble moving it, she doesn't know that its the vaccine. The Facility of vaccine administration was private Facility, she actually saw Firefighters getting the vaccine. She did not have to make any physician office visit or ER visit. She has had no Vaccines on the same day as her covid vaccine, or in the 4 weeks prior. Family medical history: No, her parents are deceased for quite a while.

It went fine and I had the expected sore arm, but that night I noticed my shoulder seemed more sore than usual - more in the joint that the muscle than I normally see. We were at my fianc�'s daughter's house and she's a pharmacist so I mentioned this so she looked at my arm and immediately noticed that they gave the injection too high in my shoulder. She said it could lead to some complications so keep an eye on it and have it checked out if the pain didn't go away after a week or two. It continued to be sore and even getting painful. On November 17th I finally sent a message to my doctor , telling her that it hurt every time I moved my arm and even without movement, there was a constant ache with pain shooting into my arm. I found out she was out of the office due to a family emergency and continued trying to treat it with ice, heat,  and Tylenol (I can't take ibuprofen), but it got so bad that on Friday, November 19th I finally went to urgent care. They examined me and felt it was due to the incorrect placement of the flu shot injection and resulting inflammation and prescribed me prednisone and told me to try to keep moving my arm to help the inflammation go away.  The prednisone helped while I was on it, although it didn't completely take the pain away, but as soon as I was off of the meds, the pain came right back. As urgent care told me to update Dr  if I still had pain after I was done with the prednisone, I did that. On November 29th, she prescribed another short taper of prednisone, which I just finished. This short taper slightly helped, but I still had significant pain during it, and now that I'm done with it, the pain is back at extreme levels.",,,,,,,,,N,11/08/2021,11/08/2021,0,Urgent care visit but no lab or medical tests,PVT,,"Metformin, Januvia, Citalopram, Wellbutrin, Topamax",None,Type 2 diabetes,,,2,12/07/2021,,,Y,None

On 4/14 I did not feel sick but my brain was in a fog and I couldn't think. Around 8pm that night I developed a headache. That night, around 1am on 4/15, I woke up drenched in a cold sweat with a splitting headache. The pain was so bad it caused me to vomit. I would describe the level of pain in my head as unbearable. For a while I honestly thought I might be having an aneurysm, but figured a call to 911 would not save my life it were actually an aneurysm (also when in that much pain, making a call is impossible anyway). I slept until 2pm 4/15 when the pain became bearable. I suffer tension headaches almost monthly, but this was very different and intense. It was the first migraine and only I've experienced. Early on 4/16 my period started about 1.5 weeks earlier than it should have.   Though I at first doubted this was a reaction to the vaccine, given it happened a week later, I have since realized it likely was. Sometime after my second dose, I spoke to friends, also women in their 30s, and four of them had had a similar series of events - migraine and early period - a number of days after their first dose. Medical studies really need to take women?s health into account. Knowing I might have this reaction would NOT have stopped me from getting the vaccine, but it would have made me feel a lot better during the episode to know what was happening and why, as opposed to thinking I might be dying of an aneurysm. To realize I was not alone in the experience was an immense relief.  I have not had a migraine since. I had no discernible reaction to the second dose. I have yet to notice any reaction to the booster, which I got five days ago.

1928728,12/07/2021,MN,76.0,76,,M,,EXTREME LEFT SHOULDER PAIN PERSISTING 60 DAYS.   TWO TRIPS TO URGENT CARE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY.,,,,,,,,,U,10/28/2021,10/28/2021,0,"X-RAY LEFT SHOULDER 11-15-2021   ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.    THE PATIENT RECEIVED THE 2ND OF THE 2 SHINGRIX SERIES ON OCTOBER 28TH, AND VERY SOON THEREAFTER DEVELOPED ANTEROLATERAL SHOULDER PAIN WHICH HAS PERSISTED WITHOUT RADICULOPATHIC SOUNDING SYMPTOMS, BUT SYMPTOMATIC IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS BOTHERED HIM TO FORWARD FLEX HIS SHOULDER MUCH ABOVE 90-100 DEGREES.  WAS SEEN IN TEC ON 11/03 AND THE DICTATION FROM THAT ENCOUNTER IS REVIEWED. SYMPTOMATIC MEASURES WERE DISCUSSED BASICALLY USING IBUPROFEN AND ACETAMINOPHEN.  THE PATIENT WAS SEEN AGAIN IN TEC ON 11/15 WITH CONTINUED SYMPTOMS LEADING TO AN X-RAY OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER, WHICH WAS READ AS SHOWING DEGENERATIVE CHANGES, THOUGH THESE ARE FAIRLY MINIMAL AS I LOOK AT THE FILMS AND WE LOOKED AT THEM TOGETHER TODAY WHICH HAS GENERALLY GOOD GLENOHUMERAL SPACE MAINTENANCE.    PATIENT IS RIGHT-HANDED AND BECAUSE OF HIS DISCOMFORT BEYOND ABOUT 90-100 DEGREES OF FORWARD FLEXION, HE HAS BEEN FAVORING THE SHOULDER, AND UNDERSTANDABLY SO THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRYING TO MAINTAIN RANGE OF MOTION IN AN INJURED SHOULDER REGION SO AS TO AVOID CONTRACTED MUSCLES, LIGAMENTS/ROTATOR CUFF STRUCTURES, ETC., AND HE RECOGNIZED THAT PRINCIPAL RIGHT AWAY AND AS I EVALUATE HIS RANGE OF MOTION ABDUCTION, INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ROTATION GENERALLY WELL PERFORMED.  HE HAS SOME LIMITATION OF INTERNAL ROTATION, BUT THE MAIN DISCOMFORT IS ANTEROLATERALLY WITH A FORWARD FLEXION AS MENTIONED.  THERE IS NO MASS IN THE REGION.  NO EVIDENCE OF INFLAMMATION.   ASSESSMENT: There apparently was some type of inflammation that developed after the most recent Shingrix immunization (the 1st Shingrix given in August I believe did not cause him any symptoms at all, and I suspect that his recent symptoms will improve, noting that he is scheduled to be seen in physical therapy on 12/02/2021.  I spoke with him about a symptom limited progressive exercise program, focusing on 25 reps twice daily with all of the above ranges of motion:  Most importantly forward flexion and then abduction, internal rotation, external rotation in a progressive manner as his symptoms would allow.  I suggested we could try a short course of steroids for its anti-inflammatory effect, but he did not wish to do that, preferring to continue with his ibuprofen and acetaminophen regimen-he could possibly consider locally applied over-the-counter Voltaren 1% gel as well for its local anti-inflammatory effect.  We talked about the potential side effects of nonsteroidal products which should always be used with food noting that his most recent serum creatinine on 03/15/21 was 0.94 with a GFR of 79.    Again, the concept of progressive range-of-motion symptom limited is quite important so as to hopefully avoid loss of function, the extreme of which would be a ""frozen shoulder"" but conceptually I think was useful to him in terms of trying to be more active with his dominant right shoulder.  He also will receive the high-dose influenza vaccine today and a booster for his Pfizer 1 of which will be given in the right shoulder.  The other the left shoulder. He can decide which of the 2 he prefers.    As mentioned, he is scheduled to be seen in physical therapy on 12/02/2021-I did not reschedule him in this department at this time, but he is urged to be in touch should he have subsequent signs/symptoms of concern despite today's discussion and recommendations.   IMPRESSION: Apparent post immunization rotator cuff inflammation, right shoulder as discussed above. 11/22/2021 18:15 DT: 11/22/2021 23:21 DOC#: 938874862 MT: im",PHM,,,,,,,2,12/07/2021,,Y,Y,

Around day 4 after injection I started becoming exceptionally short of breath when moving. I am unable to move even 10 feet without becoming completely out of breath and needing to rest. It typically takes minutes to an hour to recover breath and the simple act of standing can cause me to be out of breath.

In the emergency department the patient was found have a positive Breathalyzer test and have a positive serum ethanol level.  As he was slightly tachycardic he was given lorazepam per his request.  He had also reported at that time of some abdominal discomfort that had started earlier in the day and he also had a cough and complained of some shortness of breath despite being on room air.  Patient's lab testing was remarkable for mildly elevated liver enzymes as well as a positive COVID-19 PCR test.  Patient was thought to warrant admission to the hospital for observation. The patient was quickly discontinued from benzodiazepines as he had no overt signs of alcohol withdrawal.  He remained on room air throughout his hospital course.  Discussing with the patient, he stated that he was quite concerned about his nausea which he states he has had for some time he normally takes famotidine and Zofran at home.  His abdominal exam was benign and imaging in the form of CT of the abdomen pelvis was obtained which showed no acute pathology.  Patient's labs remained stable with a particularly stable hemoglobin.  At this point, getting nausea was uncertain but upon evaluating the patient throughout the day, he notably had spent the majority of his time sleeping and did not have any issues with nausea until he was woken up. After informing the patient that he appears to be medically stable for discharge from the hospital, he became quite concerned about his disposition plan as he stated that he was homeless and had no place to go.  Help ensure a stable/safe discharge plan, medical social work was involved and the patient was able to be discharged to a facility where he could stay in isolation due to his COVID-19 status.

1929113,12/07/2021,IL,46.0,46,,F,,"Since I have had adverse reactions to a vaccine before, I waited 30 minutes before leaving.  On the drive home, I began shivering and my left arm was throbbing.  When I got home, I pulled my short sleeve up and saw the injection area was swelling.  Under the band-aid, there was a small bruise, but I don't believe that had any impact on what was happening.  I took 600mg of Ibuprofen and grabbed an ice pack.  The shivering and cold I was feeling got progressively worse (omitting any impact the ice pack had, which was negligible).  I took my temperature around noon because I was still freezing under 2 pairs of leggings, undershirt, tee-shirt, sweatshirt, hat on my head, and a blanket.  My body temperature was in the low 96 range, verified by using 2 different oral and one ear thermometer.  ( I do not recall exactly, but I put that info in the vsafe app).  My arm continued to swell.  By the next day, it looked like someone put a ball under my skin, with surrounding areas swollen.  It was at least 3 inches in diameter.  When I lifted my arm, even the feel of fabric brushing the area caused increased pain.   I continued with the Ibuprofen and added zyrtec hoping it might help if there was any sort of allergic component.  The shivering continued and my low body temperature persisted for more than a week.  It took several weeks for my arm to heal.  It healed in time for dose 2 on Feb 9, but I was reluctant.  I spoke with some of the nurses there before agreeing to get dose 2.  One of them told me that the shivering was not uncommon, but she doubted many monitored  their  temperature like I did, and the swelling was not uncommon either.  I described as above, but she told me that the trend was that people who did not do that well with dose 1 (citing all of the people who were vaccinating for the county that had dose 2) did not have many complaints after dose 2.  They recommended I stick around for 45 minutes, which I did (since the last reaction began within 45 minutes).  Fearing I might lose use of my right arm (while I'm ambidextrous, my left hand writing has suffered as all of my work setup is geared toward right handed people), we used my left.  I showed the nurse where the first one was, so she moved the dose 2 site about 1.5"".   I was fine after 45 minutes with only a mild swell, so they had me stick around another 15.  No change, so I went home.  Again, it was not nearly as bad as the first, but it was bad enough that I still needed Ibuprofen, ice packs, and had difficulty raising my arm at a 45 degree angle for several weeks.  The chills lasted only a few days and my temp was closer to normal (though I do not recall exactly).   Since the vaccines, I have had recurrent issues with my arm.   While not always having me think I needed to head to the doctor, I did schedule more than once, but cancelled because the pain resolved before I was seen several days later.  I occasionally get a ""zap"" in the area my arm swelled both times. Once, I was lifting a box ( I have had intermittent back issues, so I am VERY careful), and I felt the zap.  My right arm was fine.  My left swelled some and was sensitive to pressure for almost 2 weeks.  After a week and a half, I decided I needed to see the doctor, made the appointment, but cancelled the day before because there was nothing to see.  Many more instances since that are all similar.  I am currently about 5 days into the most recent issue.  I was pulling on our Christmas tree, trying to straighten it, and felt the zap.  Due to my angle, there was actually more tension on my right arm than left, and it is a 7.5' artificial tree, so not anything that was of significance.  This time, it is one of the ""bad"" ones, and I have made an appointment with my doctor.  I'm going to keep this one, regardless of if it feels fine or not.  As I type, I can feel a general ache and occasional more significant pain  that radiates up the muscle into my shoulder, then if I turn my head a bit left and slightly up, radiates up the left side of my neck about 2"" from my spine.   Other general observations and info: 1.  While it was nameless to us, I had COVID in January 2020.  I barely moved for 8 days, had a 103.5 fever for 5, above 100 for 9 or 10 days, used my inhaler about every 4 hours, ached all over, and coughing.  I cannot recall everything because I slept for most of those days.  Not flu.  Just before feeling really sick, I noticed that my son's shoes didn't smell nearly as awful as they had ( strange statement, but true) and everyone thought I was crazy.  Then, I was cooking and was tasting the tacos and guacamole for seasoning.  It all tasted ""off"", so my daughter jumped in and finished.  To this day, avocados still have a more ""earthy"" taste, which is off from what I remember.  Most of my smell and taste came back by March/April.   2.  I did not feel back to ""normal"" energy-wise till April.   3.  Since the vaccine, my energy level is lower (not improving despite additional measures), I get more frequent migraines, and the issue with my arm is still problematic.",,,,,,,,,N,01/12/2021,01/12/2021,0,Pending,OTH,,"Adderall, Bupropion, Levothyroxine.
