She does note mild headache, which is not abnormal for her.  No residual tongue sensitivity or facial swelling.  She noted that when she got home last night, she felt very sleepy and sedated from the diphenhydramine and went to bed, and did not take an additional dose of diphenhydramine last night.  No SOB, trouble swallowing or any new complaint.  No urticaria or itching.    We reviewed current CDC recommendations to decline second vaccination given her moderate severe allergic symptoms within first 4 hours of first vaccination.  She will follow up with PCP or kidney specialist if she has any continued concern with ongoing symptoms or new issues.

Tingling and rash subsided about an hour after taking the antihistamine, but all of the other symptoms remained.  My shot was at 1:50 PM and just before 11 PM I had instant onset of pain in my chest wall with breathing.  It went across the top of both breasts in the center where my ribs meet my sternum.

She got in her car and drove back to work.  The feeling that something was very wrong worsened during the drive and she started itching on her arms and legs approximately 25 minutes after receipt of the vaccination.  She did not have a rash or hives but the itching became very intense and spread to her entire body within a few minutes.  She started to feel that her throat was tight or swollen but thought perhaps it was due to something else.  However, within another 15 minutes she was having difficulty swallowing and her voice changed as she was talking to patients (hoarse).  The throat symptoms continued for 30 to 45 minutes and were quite uncomfortable but she did not seek medical attention.  They started to resolve after 30 to 45 minutes.  However, her intense itching continued for several hours.  She took Benadryl but it did not help.  All her symptoms resolved after several hours and she slept well.  The following day, within 24 hours, she felt her throat swelling again.  This lasted for a few hours but she did not seek medical care because she could breathe.  She developed a temperature of 100.8 degrees Farenheit which resolved after 4 hours but then the intense itching started again and continued into the next day.   She saw her PCP (third day after receiving the Moderna vaccination) and received a steroid shot and started taking Claritin 10mg daily and Pepcid 20mg twice daily which helped some but did not relieve the itching.  The itching worsened again on January 26th, 2021 and she was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg which helps but makes her extremely sleepy.

Sometimes it felt deeper than surface.  I do have a scar from my port which was removed in 11/2020 and the location of the pain correlated at times with the scar but not consistently. I thought the pain was sore muscles since I had done some light weight exercises with my arms the morning of the vaccine.  But the pressure aspect of it was different than sore muscles. And I could feel a localized pain when I swallowed or burped, like it was on the inside of my esophagus. The pain didn't seem to hurt with deep breaths. I thought it'd get better if it was related to muscles and the vaccine, but it just seemed to linger.  I tried mylanta to test the esophagus theory and it improved. Then after a few more days of not resolving, I saw doctor. My biggest concern and fear at that visit was breast cancer recurrence. I was envisioning and enlarged node in my chest or lung. Eek! I had had a couple episodes at some point of painful swallowing prior to all this that I recalled in the visit so we opted to do an EGD. He also  prescribed omeprazole which seemed to help.  Had EGD done on 1-27-2020. Normal except for a loose GE junction which wasn't a surprise since I occasionally experience reflux.  I'm seeing my oncologist next week for my usual 3 month visit.

The patient reported that she got the shot. After the first dose received on 21Dec2020 she was fine and experienced no problems but; after the second dose received on 07Jan2021 she had a headache and she didn't go to work. The next day after the second shot she had fever and felt sick on 08Jan2021 and she wasn't going to call about that but then, less than a week later, on Jan2021 she had a stomach virus. She was not sure if it was a stomach virus or something related to the vaccine. She was not going to call but her dad said, ""Well they won't know if you don't tell them so you could tell them and maybe see if other people have had that associated with it or not."" So, she was going to see in the reporting information if other people had this issue or if it was just like a fluke GI bug that happened soon after she got the shot. She got the second shot on Thursday 07Jan2021 and then on Friday 08Jan2021 she stayed home with fever. On 09Jan2021 she felt fine and headache was recovered. Then the following Thursday 14Jan2021 she woke up at 1AM throwing up and having diarrhea. If it was a GI bug on 14Jan2021 it was the worst GI bug she ever had and right now she doesn't know but she went through the whole process of a GI bug. She couldn't eat anything for a day on Jan2021. She was barely able to drink water on 15Jan2021. She felt better that weekend and she was only eating soup and crackers, but she felt better. But then as soon as she added something else to her diet besides soup and crackers, she started feeling sick again, it did not go well. She was still only able to eat soup and crackers and feels very nauseated on Jan2021 all the time. She would like to know if this was a common reaction from the vaccine. That was on Sunday night 17Jan2021 that she started to feel sick again. On Monday she went to work but they only worked a half day and she was thankful because the only thing she wanted to do was come home and take a shower and go to bed. It had continued from there, still to the point that she said she would go get tested for COVID because she was exposed to a person that tested positive for the virus between her second dose and the first dose. A person very close to her tested positive and then she was around that person for week, it was her fiance. She still got the second shot and she was hopeful that she wouldn't get it; they were careful and wore a mask and everything. She informed that she got COVID-tested yesterday 19Jan2021 and she got this ""app thing"" but she was unsure about the accuracy of the (state name) health app and the app says her COVID test was negative but her work hasn't called her yet to confirm that it was negative so she was not sure if the app was legitimate. With the (state name) health app she was thinking it would be random they are sending texts to her phone so; they knew that she got a test. She also had an antibody test on an unspecified date after she received her vaccine (unknown which dose) and it was negative; she would like to know if this meant it was not effective. She stated she has never had a GI bug linger like this one. Her stomach was still gurgling in Jan2021, and she was still eating soup and crackers and it has been a week. As for her primary care, she hasn't seen them in a while, she can just skip that. She stated she started feeling sick with the GI bug symptoms on 14Jan2021. She got her second dose on 07Jan2021 and then, on 08Jan2021 was when she was sick with the fever. By that Saturday 09Jan2021 the fever was gone. Then on 14Jan2021 the GI bug symptoms developed. She says the diarrhea and vomiting have stopped; her stomach was just gurgling and she can't eat anything except soup and crackers. The vomiting and diarrhea started and ended on 14Jan2021, but she stopped eating and drinking; so, once everything came out that was the end of that. She just has not gotten back to normal. She says she would not say recovered with lasting effects because she does not think she has recovered at all. She would just say she still has not gotten back to normal. Vaccine Supplemental Form: Pfizer Suspect Vaccine and Vaccination Details. Time the Vaccination Was Given: 07Jan2021 at 11 AM. Anatomical Location of Administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: right deltoid. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital as an employee. She remembers it was 4AM that she woke up with fever on 08Jan2021 she already had started taking Tylenol because she didn't want to get anything, and she didn't take any more after dinner on 07Jan2021. She thought she would be fine at that point, but she woke up at 4AM on 08Jan2021, sweating and not feeling good, just feeling sick. Vaccine Administered at Military Facility? No. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: First dose on 21Dec2020. She also has another question before she got the second shot. She asked the lady when she went to get it too. She stated her fiance got sick 29Dec2020 and apparently it came out later that he was exposed on 27Dec2020. She didn't see him until 30Dec2020. He started showing symptoms on 29Dec2020 and then on 30Dec2020, he got tested and she saw him, then he stayed with her because he lives with his elderly parents. He stayed there and they had talked about it before that he would come there to stay with her if he tested positive. She just thought she could handle it better than his parents and she already had the first vaccine but then she was around him 30Dec2020 then got her second dose on the 07Jan2021. Her question was, was there a problem that she was around someone that had COVID. The lady she asked said as long as she doesn't have symptoms, it was not contraindicated. She was told that if she has active symptoms, she should not get it. Since she was not having symptoms, the lady told her it was up to her and she could take it if she wanted it. She wanted to know could that be why she was having these issues because she was around someone with COVID. She further stated that if her COVID test truly does come back negative and her stomach does not straighten out, then she will have to go to the doctor. Also, she stated that they may want to test her for a GI bug or food poisoning, but nothing has been done at this time. She did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn't believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don't believe it was.

Swelling and fluid spread - filling right side of body, across right collar bone, halfway down torso and slightly around the back. It also spread down the right arm halfway to elbow. The on-call nurse originally thought it could be cellulitis but after being told there was no redness or itchiness, she was unsure of the diagnosis and suggested to talk with the on-call doctor or go to the ER. The on-call doctor really had no idea as to what was going on. Once at the ER, the doctor checked with other doctors and read as much as he could about this type of reaction. Nothing he read matched up exactly with what was going on. He did note some swelling of lymph nodes had been reported but not to this extent. With all this being new, he suggested to go home and watch the swelling and come back if things got worse. For several days, there continued to be no redness or itchiness. The discomfort was only in the lymph node in the right armpit, with some slight pressure from the skin tightening around the fluid on the arm. Within a week, the welling was completely gone and the lymph node discomfort lasted a couple days more.     I feel it necessary to note that I don't believe the shot was given in the correct location. As soon as the needle entered the skin, my thought was 'that is too high' and there was a pain like I have never felt with a vaccine before. That pain subsided shortly after the injection but it was several days before the injection site felt better. Now, two weeks later, I have a constant pain in my shoulder, slightly down my arm and into my collar bone area. There are also times when the pain throbs or shoots through as well.

""Subject: Re: Attention Covid Vaccine Volunteers  Hello, I had received my vaccine earlier today and just awoken to chest pains. I do not think it wise to be there for my shift in the next 8 hrs. I will stay and observe for additional  symptoms.     I was on vacay and had out-of-office notice set for my email. I discovered this email yesterday while catching up on emails.  I immediately called her. She described the details of the events; stated she has not sought medical care; all symptoms resolved spontaneously but still has some intermittent, mild SOB>   She sent me this email describing the reaction: Here explanation of the reaction:     Thank you for the follow up. Below is a list of symptoms I experienced after I received my initial dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I am scheduled to receive my 2nd dose next week on the 13th of January.   following up:   I received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45 min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season breathing, and a slight headache on my rt temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At ~ 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At ~ 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I noticed much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopeful that all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night.""  I advised she contact her PCP to determine if follow up is indicated given persistent, intermittent cough and SOB.",,,,,,,,,,12/23/2020,12/23/2020,0,,PVT,,,,,,,2,02/04/2021,,,,

I was very fatigued and sleepy and then on 01/28/2021 I woke up with a blister to my forehead and then later that afternoon developed another one on my neck and then a few more later that night to the back of my neck on my c-spine. On 01/30/2021 my left ear was very sore to the back side of it and also the inside of my ear was itchy and painful as if I was developing a small pimple . This developed into itching to the inside of my ear and also redness and what looks like a rash and some eczema as this was looked at by  one of the RN's here at the clinic. I am still continuing to have fatigue and sleepiness which is not normal for me and I am still having bouts of diarrhea and stomach pain that is not my normal stomach pain. I also sent this to doctor as I wanted this to be documented in my medical record as I am due for my booster vaccine on 02/10/2021 and I am not feeling up to par to receive this at that time.

I couldn't stop coughing at work. At home that night - used inhaler again and I had an elevated temperature - 99. something is high for me. I missed work on Tuesday. Couldn't breathe and it hurt my chest to breathe. My temp was over 100. Dr appt - went to it late afternoon he wanted me test for COVID. Took vitals - mostly normal - temp.; checked OXYGEN - normal. COVID test - was positive. Temperature went to 101 that night - couldn't breathe good - couldn't stop shaking; I was aching and I was in pain; I couldn't feel warm enough. Tried to sleep and drink fluids. Still didn't have test results from COVID test on Thursday - temp was up to 102 now. The doctor said they couldn't do anything until they had results back of test. Friday - 101 and 102.8 - temperature that day. After hours clinic - I called them - Dr - I had to gasp for every breath and I was coughing a lot. He prescribed Benzymidate - cough pearls and Azithromycin  - started taking those that night. By Sunday afternoon, my fever continued and I still didn't have COVID results yet.  My mom took me to  Urgent Care on Sunday - still running fever; he looked at my lungs and listened -  he could hear wheezing and crackling in my lungs - he determined pneumonia - he didn't know what kind - he gave me Augmentin - he told me to use both my Albuterol inhaler and steriod haler;  Mucinex expectorant twice a day; Vit C and Vit D and Elderberry and Tylenol and two antibiotics. Saturday - before I went to Urgent Care on Sunday - I noticed I couldn't smell.  Monday is when I got the positive test for COVID.   Provided info to work and I tried to figure out how to work. Even though I was still very sick, I worked again online on Monday. But I couldn't keep working - got really whoozy; coughing and gasping  felt like I was going to pass out and felt like I could hardly breathe.  My mom called 911 for me. I managed to get to the bathroom - but having trouble breathing and I almost threw up - heard ringing in my ears and room was spinning. There is a lot of things after that I don't remember - when they moved me to ambulance to hospital  bed I realized I had an IV in me.  They stabilized me. They let me go home. I took the rest of the week off from work. Took a lot of medication and was keeping up with my vital during that week - 99.8 - 102.8 - for ten days I ran that fever. Broke Jan 20th. I went back to work on Jan 25. Still had to use an inhaler a lot. I'm slowly getting taste back; I can't taste flavor but can taste salt . I'm slowly getting smell back. I still have a lot of congestion but not as bad. Ears were bothering me this weekend so I did go to urgent care on they put me on a third antibiotic for an ear infection.

This pharmacist reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:30 AM at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in jaw and headache. Concomitant medication included Tylenol for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw. The patient (retired pharmacist) stated that she and her husband got the COVID shot on Tuesday (19Jan2021) and prior to getting the vaccine, she was suffering temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw and took Tylenol that morning. Patient just came back from urgent care and was prescribed a dose pack of prednisone to take for 5 days for the TMJ and she is concerned about taking it because she knows it can suppress the immune system and she does not want to make the vaccine less effective. She was trying to figure out if she should just tough it out and not take the steroid. She and her husband, who was on warfarin, had a mild headache after the first shot but he has sinus issues and she had the TMJ, they were not sure if the headaches were from those things or the vaccine. Patient asked if she can take Tylenol since she found out that that may not have been a good idea. She was advised to take Prednisone and she was asking if she can take it or will it affect the efficacy of the vaccine. She stated not knowing that taking Tylenol can effect the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine, she had taken Tylenol before she received her COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 (Tuesday). Patient said her TMJ jaw pain was still a problem after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, so she had gone to her doctor, and her doctor prescribed Prednisone, a corticosteroid. She said she was not going to take the Prednisone because she does not want the Prednisone to cause an issue with the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said she then read that studies performed on children said that children that took Tylenol did not get as good of an immune response from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said since she already took a dose of Tylenol for her TMJ jaw pain before receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, she was afraid to take any further Tylenol. Patient clarified that the Tylenol she took was the generic Equate brand, 500mg. She said she took 2 Equate brand generic Tylenol 500mg for jaw pain on Tuesday morning (19Jan2021) prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had disposed of Equate brand generic Tylenol bottle and cannot provide the UPC, Lot and Expiration Date. Reported that both her and her husband did have a headache all day long after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband believes his headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine or from her TMJ jaw pain. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she usually has a headache accompanying the TMJ jaw pain. Also reported that she always gets her vaccines in her left arm. Patient was surprised she and her husband did not have anything more than a headache after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said when she had the Shingles Vaccine, she could not lay on her left side for a week because her arm was so sore for 2 days, and when she had the flu shot she could not get out of bed for a day. Patient clarified she got her first dose of the Shingrix Shingles Vaccine in Nov2020, and does not plan to go and get her second Shingrix dose until the summer of 2021. Patient stated that she does not want the second dose of the Shingrix Vaccine interfering with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient had headache on 19Jan2021, reported as mild. Patient also had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021, and the left arm soreness was gone in less than 24 hours. Patient further clarified that she had a headache before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her TMJ jaw pain acts up if she eats. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she gets an excruciating headache. She said she has no headache pain at all right no.

The patient has put on 30 lbs. during the COVID-19 pandemic. She clarified she had foot surgery a year ago, and first put on 10 lbs., and then after the pandemic, and being diagnosed with breast cancer, gained the remaining weight. Her COVID-19 test was done on the day after Thanksgiving, clarified as 27Nov2020. She said she was told on 27Nov2020 that she had regular pneumonia and was given medication and was sent home. She said she was too sick to get out of bed, and her doctor told her to go to the emergency room. She said she went to the hospital and the hospital told her she was given the wrong medication for her pneumonia. She said while she was at the hospital emergency room, she was diagnosed with the COVID-19 Virus, and she was admitted to the hospital. She said she and her family were quarantined from the time of her hospital discharge on 08Dec2020 until Christmas week 2020. She said the CDC recently changed the guidelines for having surgery after being diagnosed with the COVID-19 Virus. She said the CDC guidelines say a person cannot have surgery until 8 weeks after having the COVID-19 Virus. She said her surgery was originally scheduled for 18Jan2021 but had to be pushed out to 05Feb2021. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Thursday, 14Jan2021, and then developed a fever of 100.6 on Friday night, 15Jan2021. She said she knows she didn't have a fever earlier in the day on 15Jan2021 because she has her temperature scanned at work before she can enter the building. She said all day long she was achy and sore on 15Jan2021, but thought the achiness and soreness was because she just went back to work. She said she realized later in the day on 15Jan2021 that things really weren't right. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office.

She asked if the vaccine has to be exactly 3 weeks apart. She said she has a question about her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She asked if the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose has to be given at exactly 21 days. She clarified she received her first COVID- 19 Vaccine dose on Thursday, 14Jan2021, and her second dose is scheduled for 04Feb2021. She was asking about the length of time between receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose because she is scheduled for major surgery the day after she is supposed to receive the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She reported that she had COVID-19 back in Nov2020 and was hospitalized. Since she has major surgery scheduled for the day after the second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, she asked if it is safer to move her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose now than for her to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose the day before her major surgery and risk having a temperature, and possibly having her major surgery cancelled and rescheduled. She said she either has to reschedule the date for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose or move the date for her surgery. She said she was diagnosed with breast cancer (in early Sep2020), and if she changes her surgery date, the new surgery date will be moved way out. She said she needs to get the surgery over with. She asked if she gets her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on Thursday, 04Feb2021, can she still have her surgery on Friday, 05Feb2021.
