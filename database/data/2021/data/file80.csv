Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I'm a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I'm so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening.

Eye stopped watering mostly by Saturday -----------------------------------  Week 2  Dizzy moment again at a friend's  house(hadn't eaten that day).  Numbness through arms/weakness. May 10th: Panic attack. I was driving home and felt the numbness go through my arms so I pulled off and called friends to come and get me and take me home.  Ended up calling another firend who is a nurse and she had me squeeze someone's hand and check my face for sign of a stroke etc.  She thought I was having a panic attack and said to get some food, take some melatonin and try to calm down and goto sleep which I did.  May 11th: Saw General doc  who ordered blood work and heart monitor. No recommendations for immediate issue. EKG looked fine.  Through the week Numbness and tingles in arms and head Ringing in ears, lots of head/sinus pressure, unable to focus, brain fog. -----------------------------  Week 3 May 19th: Had blood drawn for testing: Night before getting heart monitor I couldn't sleep because it felt like not breathing fast enough made me light headed to the point I could pass out and was getting worried.  May 20th: Fitted with a heart monitor for 48 hours.  I was freaking out when we got to the hospital and almost went to the ER but we went to cardiology and saw the nurse who helped calm me down and did another EKG which looked good. Blood pressure was high that day possibly from the anxiety. Stayed at my dad's the next few days with the monitor, had tingles a couple times, some pressure, but slept well. ------------------------------  Week 4 May 24th: Followup with General doc said blood tests looked good, not diebetic, blood pressure fine, no signs of heart problems.  Gave me 6 days of prednisone and Nasonex for possible inflammation of Eustachian tube. (didn't feel like they helped any)  through the week: Felt okish for a day and a half, drove to work and then towards the end of the day started feeling off, right side feels like it's floating up and down, sensation down through leg which lasted about a week. Pushed in between nose and cheek on right side and felt numbness/pain shoot through my head on that side Periods of ringing again though not as much but also periods of head pressure and pain if resting head on hands etc. ---------------------------  Week 5 Muscle spasms in both arms lasting a couple minutes, finger twitching on left hand.  Also had muscle spasms in legs since.  ENT visit June 2nd: Audiologist tested hearing and saw no issues. ENT  gave me an exam and did not find any issues with the Eustachian tube or any other problems.  Suggested to do see if the symptoms continue to lessen and if they dont then do a VNG test and if that doesn't provide anything that he would have to refer me to a Neurologist next to see if they can find anything.

My periods came a week early, and lasted for the entirety of the rest of the cycle (totaling 2 weeks of bleeding). The bleeding was extremely heavy containing intense and large clotting for the entirety of the period. Aside from losing a tremendous amount of blood, I have experienced heavy cramping in the lower abdomen and lower/mid back regions both during these periods and even sometimes when I am not bleeding at all. These side effects coupled have caused me to feel fatigued to the point of feeling like I needed to pass out, and due to this I adopted to taking iron supplements daily during the irregular bleeding (chelated iron, 18 mg capsules as recommended). As a result of this concerning symptom, I scheduled a visit to see my primary OBGYN, and was told that this is a common issue that they have been seeing following patient vaccinations.

During that admission her gabapentin dose was decreased and she was given 5 days of Macrobid on discharge for a possible urinary tract infection.  We also arrange follow-up with cardiology for loop recorder and to see orthopedics as an outpatient the etiology for her syncopal episode was unclear.  It was not felt to be seizure related.  She went home with home health care.  She unfortunately was readmitted on 5/29-6/3 new onset acute pancreatitis with an unknown etiology and was ultimately discharged to rehab.  During that hospitalization patient reported that she was seen by cardiology for her 2 syncopal episodes that occurred earlier in the month and a cardiac cause of her syncope was ruled out and they recommended she be referred to neurology.  She returns back again for admission on 6/8 for encephalopathy, hypotensive, septic shock, NSTEMI and was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit on pressor support.  She was given Cipro, Flagyl, Vanco and Levophed and IV fluids.  Her septic shock was felt secondary to urinary tract infection.  The urine culture that was resulted on 5/30 grew Klebsiella pneumonia that was resistant to Macrobid.  She was not sent out on any antibiotic therapy as she was not felt to be symptomatic during her last hospital course.  She also had a CAT scan during this hospital course which showed colitis.  Urine culture from this admission was of mixed flora Greater than 100,000 colony-forming units no organisms were grown out however.  She was treated with 7 days of Cipro.  Again patient's CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis done on admission showed colitis she was seen by gastroenterology during her hospital stay and underwent an endoscopy.  It was ultimately felt that the patient's colitis was likely ischemic in nature.  Patient was also noted to be thrombocytopenic on admission which was felt to be possibly from sepsis or dilution was ultimately resolved at the point of discharge.  She also again was found to have acute blood loss anemia with no source found.  she had hematochezia noted on admission but resolved by the point of discharge.  EGD did not reveal any source of bleeding other than a tiny esophageal ulcer.  Aspirin therapy was discontinued.  She did not need transfusion during her hospital stay.  The lowest her hemoglobin went was to 7.3.  Patient's acute tubular necrosis resolved her metabolic acidosis and metabolic encephalopathy resolved and at this point she is stable for discharge to rehab.

1414032,06/21/2021,MD,48.0,48,,F,,"On Thursday, June 17th, I had a very difficult time remembering the day of the week, and specific tasks that I was working on  that I do daily on a regular basis.  I also had to think additionally for the simple tasks that I perform at work, and noticed that I also had some recall issues with remembering server names and people's names.  I couldn't keep my concentration on a single task.  I am a multitasker by profession.  Loosing my concentration ability, or my inability to focus on my assignments, cause stress-induced panic attacks throughout the day on June 17, and June 18th.  On June 17th in the morning, I noticed that both of my leg muscles immediate behind my knees started to tense up as I stretched my legs, bent my legs to sitting position, and also when I walked the stretch in my calves was painful. Starting June 17th evening, I noticed that getting into bed and out of bed resulted in the stretching in both of my legs starting to prevent me from being able to move freely as I did before June 16th at 12:45pm.   Since June 17th both of my arms when stretched wide are feeling the same tension pain as my leg muscles.  The arms are also tender to touch in the front muscle areas (both arms, FYI), in the crevis, and in my lower arms when I ball my fists.  I am using a topical pain relief ointment -- Pain-a-Trate -- daily on both arms and both legs in the adverse event sites three times a day.  My last treatment was June 21st at 7am.  Additionally, I have been monitoring my blood pressure and am noticing slightly lower numbers (on 6/19/2021, my AM reading was 131/85).  I will continue to monitor my blood pressure daily and will report any increase or decrease to the VAERS.   My anxiety is another event that started to surface on Saturday, June 19th along with the stiffness in my muscles in both legs (back of knee and calf areas) and both arms.  This caused me to have some panic attacks and I informed my children of my symptoms in the event I died or had a stroke or heart attack from the COVID-19 vaccine dose 1 of Pfizer.",,,,,,,,,N,06/16/2021,06/17/2021,1,"COVID-19 vaccine of Pfizer-BIONTech dose 1 on June 16, 2021 Lot# EW0187 by AACO DOH 06/16/21 (information taken from the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card.",SCH,,Lisinopril; Activate-C w/Zinc; Nasal Rinse; Metformin; Vitamin D; Vitamin K; Green Tea;  Water (from Vaccination site); Potassium;,"COVID-19 related anxiety on a daily and on-going, COVID-19 related PTSD;  COVID-19 related daily stress and anxiety; COVID-19 related depression symptoms;  elevated blood pressure readings (taken 2-3 times weekly at home); Occular headaches;","Anxiety; Hypertension; Metabolic Syndrome; COVID-19 induced Diabetes (as of 7/2020); Panic/Stress induced Depression; COVID-19 related anxiety on a daily and on-going, COVID-19 related PTSD;  COVID-19 related daily stress and anxiety; COVID-19 related depression symptoms;  elevated blood pressure readings (taken 2-3 times weekly at home);",,,2,06/21/2021,,Y,,Penicillin; raw carrot ingredients; fruit skins; needles (anxiety-driven stressor); that is all I am aware of at this time

I didn't know who I was or where I was and confused and on the edge of consciousness for about 45 minutes on that day. On May 13th I had a severe reaction to something and my throat closed up. Starting April 30th I had a severe cough that lasted most of May and my Doctor gave me an inhaler around the 20th of May. On May 13th I went to emergency room (they gave me Benadryl) and they couldn't find anything wrong with my heart or systems in general and kept me for observation. I then followed up with my Dr later on that week and they initially thought I had asthma and they gave me an EpiPen in case I had another reaction like that. After that I've had 5 times where I had anaphylaxis where I had to use the EpiPen and this is new because I haven't had anaphylaxis since I was 15.  Around 17th of May my brain fog started lessening and I would have 1 anaphylaxis x reaction a week since then and I continue to see my Doctor.

TECHNIQUE: Grayscale, color Doppler, and spectral waveform analysis of the left lower extremity deep venous system was performed. The common femoral, superficial femoral, proximal deep femoral, greater saphenous, and popliteal veins were evaluated. The calf veins were also evaluated.  FINDINGS: Thrombus is present in the left popliteal and posterior tibial veins. Patient was transferred to the emergency room for further evaluation  Left common femoral and femoral veins are patent There is no evidence of a popliteal or Baker's cyst.  IMPRESSION: Thrombus is present in the left popliteal and posterior tibial veins. __________________________________________________ Examination: CT ANGIOGRAM PE CHEST  Clinical history: SOB known DVT  Comparison: None  Technique: Multiple computerized axial tomographic images were obtained of the chest during administration of IV contrast according to CTA PE chest protocol. Sagittal and coronal MIP CT angiographic series were constructed.  CT imaging was performed with iterative reconstruction technique and/or automated exposure control to reduce radiation dose.  IMPRESSION: 1. Pulmonary arterial opacification is satisfactory. Pulmonary emboli are present within the right lower lobe posterior basal segmental and associated subsegmental, right upper lobe posterior segmental, and lingular and segmental arteries. Overall thrombus load is moderate. Right to left ventricular ratio is less than 0.9. There is slight flattening, though not frankly bowing of the interventricular septum. Very minimal reflux of contrast extends into the IVC and hepatic veins.  2. There is no significant pleural or pericardial effusion, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  3. The heart is not enlarged. The thoracic aorta is normal caliber.  4. Lung windows demonstrate no suspicious pulmonary infiltrate or mass. Minimal atelectasis is present within the right lower lobe.  5. There is no acute osseous pathology.  Conclusion: Bilateral pulmonary emboli. Overall thrombus load is subjectively moderate. Right to left ventricular ratio is less than 0.9, though slight flattening of the interventricular septum and contrast within the hepatic veins may suggest early signs of right ventricular strain.",OTH,,,,,,,2,06/21/2021,,Y,Y,

1415069,06/21/2021,MI,25.0,25,,M,,"Last week Monday - June 14 I worked 1pm-9pm. My opening pharmacist left around I'd say 2pm, or 2:15pm~ish and hadn't witnessed the incident. So somewhere around that approximate time I was inside the pharmacy working on a back computer by drive thru and I heard someone yell for help in the waiting area. It was the kind of help you just know means something really drastic has just occurred. I quickly entered the waiting area via the pharmacy consultation door and saw patient face down between two chairs and his nose had a consistent drip of blood that was apparent on the floor.   My technician who was in the consultation room told me he had received a Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine probably within 5 minutes of the incident. With the combination of that information and the visualization of an active bleed, I made eye contact with another staff member inside the pharmacy at will call and told him to call 911 which he turned around immediately and did. The man was alone, but the woman who yelled for help was also calling 911 I believe. At this point I'd say approximately every 3 seconds, a new drop of blood would emerge. There were a couple people nearby including the customer and I asked everyone to stay back a little, I surveyed the scene and it appeared to be safe and I approached patient as I tried to verbally get a response of some sort.  I asked if he could hear me, if he knew where he was and what happened, both with no response. The bystander recommended turning him on his side but with the unknown cause of the bleed and the recent vaccination I didn't know if it could be CNS or spinal related and since we were on the phone with EMS, we could get their recommendation of whether to move him or not.   Within 15-30 seconds probably, he started regaining consciousness and he was scared at first and rightfully so. He jolted up and back and looked at me like, ""why am I face down in my own blood (and probably in a lot of pain i'm sure)"", and it scared me a little to be honest. I told him what we had observed, and I saw the bridge of his nose stuck out beyond what was normal but I'm not sure what normal is to him..?? I saw two small lacerations on the side of his nose and a pair of glasses on the floor. I couldn't determine if they were broken or not but surmised, he must have fainted and fallen off the chair and landed on his glasses which cut and may have even broken his nose. Or maybe the ground broke his nose. Either way it looked bad. There were several store team members around at this point (those listed in this report), and the patient was given paper towels for the bleeding and bottled water. There was a store use wheelchair we put him in when he was ready and wheeled him into the consultation room where he could be monitored until EMS arrived.  While speaking with the patient before EMS arrived, he rendered all the following information:           Never had a reaction to a vaccine before           Never had any knowledge of high or low BP issues           Doesn't recall ever feeling lightheaded or dizzy upon quickly erecting           Might have low blood sugar issues                   Reasonings for the above response:                             Hadn't eaten that day yet before his shot and was feeling a little anxious about it                            Last time he gave blood he hadn't eaten breakfast and passed out after that                                         This was the only other fainting history mentioned                                        He did say it was within the last 6 months  EMS arrived within another 2-3 minutes I'd say at which time we had already began the cleaning process.

I went to the ER on the 5th day after the dose, was monitored, and found to have frequent PVCs.  I followed up with my PCP and a cardiologist, who had me try Atenolol, which did not improve the palpitations, and which I could not tolerate, and then Diltiazem which also did not improve the palpitations and which made me very sleepy and unable to go to work.  My original bout of palpitations occurred for 5 days straight, 24hrs/day.  On the 6th day after the first dose, they felt mostly gone.  Even though I was very afraid to get the second dose because of my reaction from the first dose, I was advised by the cardiologist to go ahead and get the second dose.  I did not have palpitations from the 6th day after my first dose until my second dose on 2/19/21.  But they started again, just as frequent and constant as before, on the 7th day post my second dose (2/26/21).  From that time until now, I have been experiencing very frequent bouts of the constant PVC palpitations.  They used to last about 5 days at a time and give me a break for about 5 days without them, but over the last few months they have become more frequent, lasting 14 days at a time with only a day or two without them.  Now I am at the point where they never seem to go away.  My symptoms have progressed over the last few months including extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, impaired activity tolerance, and fleeting chest discomfort and pain.  Due to my frustration of having worsening symptoms and progressing to the point where I was struggling to get through my work day and had very limited ability to do any daily activities outside of work, I sought a second opinion from a different cardiologist (the one listed above).

At presentation he was afebrile with stable vital signs and was maintaining an O2 sat of 100% breathing room air. Laboratory revealed a WBC of 40.4 with a predominance of neutrophils on the differential as well as toxic granulation (patient had just recently received Neulasta on 6/17), mild elevation of his alkaline phosphatase of 199 with a normal bilirubin, and normal renal function.

The dermatologist said that it was a target lesion and it was part of my immune response to the vaccine. He gave me some steroid cream and told me to apply it for 2 weeks. I then noticed on my arm that target lesions began forming where my surgery scar is. I also developed a UTI. I felt like my bladder was not emptying all the way and my back was hurting. They are starting to kind of go away, but they are still visible. I called Dr. and he asked me some questions. He wrote me a prescription for the next week.

My right arm just kept getting more sore and sore. I was having more body aches. I was getting sluggish. They thought I wasn't feeling well because of my sickle cell. They offered for me to go home and I decided to work until 3. Towards the end of my shift, my arm was hurting, my back was hurting, and my head was hurting. I felt like I needed to lay down.

When things settle in that quickly they can normally turn real bad so I was told to call my PCP. It was over a period of time. It gradually increased. Any medicine I was taking was not helping.

I was taking my migraine medication every other day. I was also having a hard time breathing. My PCP thought that's what was making my head hurt. The headaches have been gradually intensifying. I have asthma. I believe that my headache caused me to fall. The headaches have been gradually intensifying. He has tried a few different medications and finally we found out that it's not responding to any of the medications. Turns out, it's not a headache. I didn't have any kind of nerve problems before any of this. Even my blood pressure was normal. They are trying to figure out what's caused the change and what's causing it.

About a week later she started complaining of feeling fatigued, confused, and disoriented some days. These symptoms progressively got worse over the next 3 months. She received her 2nd dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on April 05, 2021. A week later she mentioned waking up more disoriented in the mornings and would look at her hands and think to herself, ""Who's hands are these?"" She said she felt like she wasn't in her right mind. Soon after this she felt she couldn't go to the grocery store alone or drive because she might get lost. She never had symptoms of Dementia prior to March 2021. On May 10, 2021 I noticed she was moving slower and using walls to guide her through her home as she walked. She mentioned she felt more fatigued at this time. On the weekend of May 21, 2021 we took a trip for her birthday and she was mentioning how it was a struggle for her to pack for the trip because she couldn't think clearly and had made a mess in her room trying to find her clothes. She was a very tidy & organized person, so this was very unusual. A week after the trip she mentioned losing some strength in her left leg and needing to lean on walls as she walked through her home. On June 4, 2021 the weakness got worse and she mentioned she felt more ""off"" and wanted to shower before heading to the hospital to be evaluated - when she got out of the shower she completely lost strength in her left leg and fell to the ground, but was conscious. She was taken to Hospital where a CT scan was done that showed brain swelling and a mass. She was then transported to Medical Center where an MRI was done, confirming the swelling and 4cm mass - doctors there believed it could be a Glioblastoma and mentioned it is very aggressive.  When asked if the vaccine may have caused this, we were quickly dismissed and told there could be no connection at all. After further research we found that GBM (Glioblastoma) could grow as quickly as .5mm per day and when calculating the time between her 1st dose and her hospitalization (approx. 90 days) it equated to 4.5cm, her mass was 4cm. Even if there was a mass there before her vaccine, there is reason to believe it may have been aggravated by the vaccine.   Surgery was suggested, but after 4 days she expressed that she wanted to opt out of the surgery and pursue a second opinion or natural treatments. She was discharged on  June 9, 2021 and taken home with medication. She was more alert and lively at home - able to converse and move around with assistance, but did not have strength in her left leg and was losing more strength in her left arm. On June 13, 2021 she suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the emergency room by ambulance. CPR was performed in the ambulance and she was taken to Hospital where they stabilized her but she never regained consciousness.

As per discussion with Doctor, x-ray results are normal.  i used the knee cap for a week and swelling is reduced ,and again increased depends on how much i rest or walk. again following week i visited the primary care doctor and he observed the increased swelling on both knees and referred me to rheumatoid arthritis specialist. meanwhile i also insisted my Primary care doctor to do the blood work to check if i have arthritis. Blood work results came as normal.   I went to meet rheumatoid arthritis Doctor on June 14th and he looked into all the data checked my knees etc. He felt all are normal and again asked me to do the blood work to check if i have any other type of Arthritis.

The symptoms are  knee pain/inflammation, All joint(shoulders/ankel) pain - on and off.  mild head ache.

In February 2021, X-ray: frozen shoulder (abnormal) Doctor determined  frozen shoulder right after the vaccine.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment included over the counter pain relievers, applied heat and did stretching exercises. There was no relief, then tried a session with an acupuncturist and a therapeutic masseuse- neither helped this condition.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Patient visited orthopedist specializing in the shoulder on 08-Feb-2021, had X-rays and MRI scans taken over the next few days. Doctor determined frozen shoulder developed right after the vaccine. In April, the pain had not subsided, and patient's condition had not improved. Patient took a second cortisone shot which was not helpful. Soon after, the physical therapist and the patient came to the conclusion that therapy was not working. The pain was constant, her range of motion was very limited. There was no improvement despite following doctor's treatment plan. The shoulder lumps/muscle knots are large. On 08-Jun-2021, patient was examined by a renown sports injury orthopedist. He determined that patient might need surgery. He explained that the inflammation in her shoulder area was an inflammatory reaction to the Moderna vaccine. In an effort to avoid surgery, patient was referred to a doctor of Physiatry who will be administering another cortisone shot and will be overseeing next step, possibly another round of physical therapy. Surgery for these situations was complicated and there was no guarantee of recovery. Also, patient was in perfect health before this vaccine and it is evident that she was suffering a reaction to the Moderna vaccine.

I began my period that morning, before I went in for the shot. I would like to be as detailed as possible, so I will likely include some graphic details in this description. My apologies in advance.  My period normally lasts 3-4 days and is moderate (as far as I know) regarding blood loss. After the second dose, the flow was extremely heavy and my period lasted for almost an entire week (7 days). It was miserable. I was bloated and tender in that area, and extremely tired. I was also cramping, which is unusual for me nowadays.  About two weeks after that, I felt a stabbing or ripping pain in the uterus area. It stayed for about two days, throbbing every minute or so. I could not sleep those days. It was not so unbearable that I could not perform everyday actions, but it was taking up a good portion of my thoughts that weekend. After that, it went away and I thought it was over.  About three days ago from today (today is June 22nd, or 06/22/2021), the pain returned and I knew it meant the start of my period. The timing was normal. The next day I began bleeding, but the flow is again much heavier than normal. The pain is back and much worse than before. I am going through many more pads than usual and it is, for me, a worrying amount of blood. Since this is the second period in a row I am experiencing this, I felt it was necessary to report it in. I hope this is okay and not taking resources from those with worse issues.  I would also like to note that I experienced my first panic attack in 5 years the night of my second dose (for no reason- they've always had a concrete reason for occurring) and my anxiety was notably worse that week (I am on medication and was otherwise doing very well managing the anxiety). During the attack I experienced the usual symptoms: my throat closing up and making it harder to breathe, and uncontrollable shaking and crying.  I was not thinking of anything that would make me nervous at the time of the attack. I had just finished an online gaming session with a friend and was showering to prepare for bed, so I was fully relaxed.  Additionally, my mental health has notably dipped a bit over the last month, though there are a number of factors at play and I don't want to blame the vaccine for that.

The fever lingered between 104.0 and 105.2.  She also threw up and had the chills, couldn't sleep and felt horrible. Had a phone visit with a doctor prior to ending up in the ER who told us it was normal and to not be concerned unless it reached over 105.0 .  She said our daughter's fevers/reactions to vaccines were rare but normal. When it reached 105.2, we called nurse hotline and started driving toward the Facility. The nurse hotline called us back as we couldn't get through and stated we should definitely be seen at Urgent Care. We walked into urgent care, and they refused to see us and directed us to the Emergency Room if we felt it ""necessary"" Since our 4 yr old had a 105.2 fever and we were scared AND had been told to be concerned if it reached over 105.0, we ran over to ER. We were seen and axillary temperatures were taken about 3 different times which were around 102.0. I asked for a temperature under her tongue since I know that axillary temperatures aren't too accurate. By that time, her fever had come down to about 100.0 I think (we had been waiting there for an hour I believe so far) and were told by the doctor that it was normal and she was fine. I asked for a social worker or someone to help us navigate the process of somehow trying to get an exemption for the MMR vaccine to which she replied we didn't need a social worker and that that wasn't her department and I needed to follow up with my child's pediatrician.  The ER doctor's name who told us it was a ""normal"" reaction was  MD. I had a scheduled visit with my daughter's pediatrician on June 3rd already so I used that appt to also discuss my concerns with getting any more vaccines, especially the MMR.

White blood cell count 8.2 (43% neutrophils, 47% lymphocytes), hematocrit 33.9, platelets 343.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, bicarb 21, BUN 9, creatinine less than 0.2, AST 22, ALT 14.  Lumbar puncture demonstrated WBC count of 4, RBC 4, glucose 57, protein 125.  CSF Gram stain did not show any organisms.  Sterile CSF culture. Chest x-ray was normal.  The patient was noted to have an apneic event with an associated desaturation and was placed on 6 L HFNC. She was subsequently transferred to  Hospital PICU for further evaluation and management.  Upon arrival she continued to have worsening respiratory status necessitating intubation.  Per parents there had been no fever, N/V/D.  She feeds breast milk and formula, no solids, no honey, no soil/dirt exposure. There's no family history of neuromuscular disorder.

S/p IVIG 2g/kg 6/11-6/15 Rapidly progressive motor weakness with respiratory failure as the admitting Dx, parents report more movements in the past 48 hours.   Compared to physical exam one week ago, there has been small but demonstrable improvement in motor function, now with some limited spontaneous movements.  Although previous clinical history and course appeared most consistent with infantile botulism, no clear exposure ever identified and now stool study negative.  Although age of presentation and descending paralysis less typical for demyelinating process such as Guillain-Barr� syndrome, the cytoalbumin disassociation on CSF studies and nerve root enhancement more consistent with this process.  Anti-GQ 1B antibody which is positive in a subset of Miller Fisher variant Guillain-Barr� syndrome and other similar demyelinating conditions with cranial nerve involvement was also negative, but certainly does not rule out Guillain-Barr� syndrome as potential etiology of her weakness.  I am very pleased that she has started to show some, albeit modest, recovery of motor movement.  Given negative stool study for botulism, would recommend repeat imaging of MRI brain with and without contrast with dedicated cuts through the IACs and brainstem, as well as MRI of total spine to assess for any evolution in prior findings.  Would also revisit the option of obtaining EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Continue supportive care.

Last communication as follows: 6/11/2021: Hi mam,  I would not do it earlier than the last week of June for a more accurate study. Also, in regards to the vaccination- unfortunately, there is no way to confirm whether it definitely did or didn't play a role, but you may be right and that it is part of this picture for you. Unfortunately, we are at a place right now where the medical community is still learning about the potential side effects since it is a new vaccination. We don't yet know exactly how long after the vaccination we can expect side effects to occur and how long they are expected to last. The good news is that it doesn't alter your treatment course either way. The same holds true for those that suffer from headaches after the vaccination or even covid-19 infection. The headaches are treated the same as regular tension headaches/migraines. If there is a component of a vaccine side effect we do expect time to help heal that as well, but I would definitely continue with our plan to proceed with the nerve study, PT, and avoiding positions that cause nerve compression.    Sincerely, PA-C   On 6/7/2021 Physician also wrote: Guillain Barre Syndrome can happen after vaccinations and is something that I did consider for you.

I had COVID in December, was bedridden for two months, and almost recovered to baseline before the jab. Here?s my V timeline:  Day 1: May 3   Several mins after J&J: Huge hot flash and vertigo spin that went away immediately   30 mins after: Felt drunk  Rest of evening: Extra sleepy  Day 2-3:  Extra dizziness and fatigue, mostly in bed. Definitely felt like I was fighting something.  Day 4: Vertigo attack.  Days 5-11: Felt better than I had since before having COVID! Less dizziness, more energy. My post-Covid symptoms such as orthostasis had greatly improved.? My resting heart rate was sometimes in the 70s!?  Day 12: ADVERSE EVENT: I felt like I got COVID all over again, but less severe. Nevertheless, my feeling of breathlessness was enough to send me to urgent care. I also had chest pain/heaviness, extra dizziness, and increased heart rate (117 resting). EKG at urgent care showed abnormalities similar to EKG I had in December when I first had Covid. So, I ended up in the emergency room. No clot or heart blockage. Doctor seemed to think either I was having a delayed reaction to the vaccine, or this was somehow Covid related.???  Day 13: Woke up feeling better until I had breakfast and had to poop. After doing that, I got so exhausted I landed back in bed all afternoon. This was another problem I had during Covid.? At least my resting heart rate was more normal, 98.

1419610,06/23/2021,CA,62.0,62,,F,,"I have neurological issues since the shot. I have trouble with concentration, problem solving activities, reading, listening in conversation, and fast-paced or complicated computer work. What happens is that I feel my brain not keeping up, lagging, drifting. It's like waves of exhaustion. Things have improved a lot for me, however there are still times when I struggle. I had high blood pressure that wouldn't settle down after the shot. I ham now on blood pressure medication and a statin for high cholesterol. I also have hearing loss and vertigo. Vertigo is every day when I go to bed. I had pain in my ears off and on since the shot. According to the audiologist, the hearing impairment is moderate but presents difficulty with particular consonants during normal levels of conversation and hearing aids are recommended. There was one test that was given during the exam where I became dizzy. The audiologist said she had never seen the result before. My plan is to have another hearing test in late July in case something might improve. The ear pain has subsided, with a sharp pain in the ear now and again, but rarely these days. Not experiencing strange sounds (crunching, or piercing high notes) like before. Although hearing loss has been verified, I believe that the problems I have had with conversation involve both hearing loss and cognition. There is problem solving involved with engaging conversation. I get dizzy, like waves of exhaustion in my mind when I'm having trouble with conversation. Thankfully this problem is much improved but it does still happen. I will now paste in a log I was keeping in case the dates, etc., are helpful.   March 19, 2021 Since learning yesterday that my antibody test result for Covid-19 is negative, I want to document what I have experienced since receiving the Pfizer vaccine on March 8th, 2021.   I am a 62-year-old female who is healthy, although somewhat overweight who has had uncontrolled high blood pressure off and on in the past. I also have osteoarthritis and a history of migraines. I experienced neurological symptoms and other symptoms after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 on March 8th. These included dizziness, flushes of heat, chills, vertigo, elevated blood pressure, tingling on the right side of my face, cloudiness in cognition, zingy nerve sensations all across my brain and waves of ""exhaustion"" (like waves in the mind, like being adrift) when using the computer (typing, proofing typed work, reading dense documents, working with excel files, working with email)�and difficulty with conversation (marked difficulty with listening), and trouble with reading.  After receiving the vaccine at around 10:45 in the morning at a pharmacy, I soon felt dizzy and quite warm during the waiting period. I removed my jacket, scarf and baseball cap; someone nearby fetched me a water bottle. After 10 minutes passed, I knew I shouldn't leave at the 15-minute mark because making my way to the window to pick up the vaccine card was not possible right then. I stayed for 30, informed the pharmacist that I was very hot and dizzy. She said she felt it was my immune response. I went to my car and cooled off there with the air conditioner. Eventually, after about 15 more minutes, I drove myself a short distance home.   Back at home it was lunch time and I had some trouble putting the lunch together. I was confused. I put something in the microwave, forgot what it was, heard the dinging and checked. It was a bowl of soup I forgot I was warming. It was only 2 inches of broth/sauce, though, and the other ingredients that go in it were in front of me still cold on the wood board. At that point, I was startled that I was having this confusion, I knew my mind was not working as normal but figured it would pass with rest, and thought that my vaccine and immune response were probably overwhelming my mind. I went to bed and felt my mind was very zingy with nerve twinges, like when you can feel nerve activity/healing going on in your body, and I slept for about three hours. I was groggy upon awakening.  I knew I had a high blood pressure issue that wasn't abating after the vaccine. Admittedly I was amped up when I went to the pharmacy get the vaccine and I'm pretty sure I had elevated blood pressure when I received the vaccine. I had tossed and turned, hadn't slept well the night before. I was scared and worried. My body's immune system is what I would call overactive and I was afraid of the response. (Not sure overactive is the right word, but my immune system protects me fiercely. I would say my immune response is intense.) Although I was afraid to get the vaccine, I wanted the benefits and knew I needed the protection.   The next thing that became apparent was a problem with conversation. I found I could not do the normal back and forth of talking and listening with my husband. I could make words and sentences, short ones preferably, not involved, but listening was almost impossible. Longer sentences I made were coming out a little slower I noticed, but not by much; they were more considered, I would say. My blood pressure would shoot up during conversation. I would get sensations in my head and feel dizzy and things would start fogging up in there somehow. I felt exhausted by conversation. I would want to run away. And for the next few days, that is exactly what I did. I stayed upstairs in my room, working remotely for my job as best I could, and not talking or listening to anyone.   I bought a blood pressure monitor and began monitoring on March 10th. Here is a table of results.  March 10 6:16 pm 150/63   80   7:10 pm 150/88   74   10:15 pm 130/68   70 After sleep March 11 11:30 am 152/84   70  March 12 7:00 am 154/79   65   9:30 am 176/78   80 On phone with advice nurse. Couldn't get appt. was told to go to Urgent Care March 12 Spent time in Urgent Care and ER. Blood pressure remained elevated.  Was told to follow up with primary care doctor for blood pressure, to make decision on meds. March 13 9:00 am 152/72   72   3:00 pm 151/75   84   5:30 pm 140/72   88   9:00 pm 145/82   74  March 14 7:00 am 150/79   66   9:30 am 157/98   79   3:38 pm 146/66   85   8:35 pm 156/72   73  March 15 7:25 am 151/78   67   10:15 am 157/70   62   1:45 pm 156/70   73   3:30 pm 178/78   96 At doctor visit. Was prescribed Cozaar 12.5 mg/day March 16 Midnight 145/72   71   6:30 am 141/80   66   8:00 am 148/82   91   3:30 pm 140/78   86   8:13 pm 134/71   73  March 17 7:30 am 128/76   67   6:00 pm 132/75   76  March 18 10:30 am 130/90   83 Ate at 10:00 am  8:45 pm 137/79   78  March 19 10:00 am 133/83   89    Over the course of this experience, I have been flushing with heat, beginning at the pharmacy. Perhaps pure high blood pressure effects, I don't know those things. I want to mention it because I do not normally flush with heat like that. On the evenings of March 13th and 14th, I had strong chills at bedtime, literally vibrated into a down coat, slept in it and many blankets. On March 12th, when moving in and out, etc., of the CT scanner at the ER, I had vertigo. I had no idea when it was over, that it had stopped, until they helped me up. I have had vertigo for about 4 nights upon going to sleep. I may have had more vertigo during this experience, but with the dizzy, I'm not sure. I began a few days ago to want very cold temperatures at night and I left my slider and my window open for sleep and enjoyed it during a 40-degree night. When I wash my hair, I'm sitting in a warm bath but I rinse my head with cold water. It feels great. And right, somehow. Warm water is not the thing for me right now, head-wise.   Neurological issues continue. I have to read somewhat slower. Reading something complex is several reads, even if just a few sentences. I have stopped on the novel I was reading. I have to type somewhat slower. Typing takes a lot out of me, much more so than usual; I have zings in my head all over sometimes when I'm writing on the computer, when I'm re-reading my writing, working, emailing, and just in general when I try to do too much on the computer. I find excel files to be overwhelming with the data everywhere and me zipping around them for my work. Luckily, I don't have an excel project going on at the moment. Right now, I would say my computer time in general has to be broken up with breaks. I never had to take breaks before when I was involved/trying to meet a deadline/ working on something. I take short walks in nature, go outside on my patio to enjoy the birds, play with my dog, when the computer has been too much for me.   Finally, I must tell you that I have a lot going on in my mind at this point in my life. I am grieving. I am peri-menopausal. My mother (82) fell and hurt herself in November and had a light stroke about three weeks ago.    April 7, 2021 As of now, I am still having neurological issues but things are much better than before. I am able to write and read and do my work on the computer for the most part. If I try to speed along, I might need to take a break, but mostly I am able to work. When it comes to excel sheets with a lot of data to manage and move around, I'm not there yet. It's overwhelming.   I am left with trouble with listening as my major complaint. What happens when I have to focus intently on listening is that I feel my brain sort of quake or drift. I have to walk away from what I'm doing to calm down this ill feeling.   April 11, 2021 I had a hard time with the quake/drift last night. I was awake at 2:30 am. (This is a fairly normal thing for me to be up in the night writing, reading or whatever; it's something I do quite a bit.) I tried to do a couple of sentences on the computer and I noticed right away that it wasn't going as it should. The two days prior, I had no drift and was feeling so hopeful. Last night I felt like I did back when this problem was at its worst. I had to stop. I had a lot of vertigo. I propped myself up on the bed at various degrees to find a good spot. I had a hard time. I meditated and apparently fell asleep; I awoke to being in a seated position, head hanging. I then tried to lay down and sleep, nope, more vertigo. I tried to meditate again and woke up the same way again. Well, finally it subsided. This morning I was not myself in terms of cognition, thinking. I was just kind of off. Maybe I was worried, this setback made me worry about my future. An awful feeling.   Some History I've gone over a few things in my mind that I want to share. One is that early on in the Pandemic, I believe I was exposed to the virus via a co-worker who had been very sick with an infection and returned to work with a terrible cough. She had had an interaction with a woman affiliated. I cannot confirm if my co-worker had Covid-19 but she told me she suspected she may and that she was considering getting tested.   In March of 2020, I had a terrible rash, red eyes and lids and red toes. The rash was like swaths of raised, red areas that felt hot and itchy like hives�they were large patches, these huge areas on my body, like continents, that migrated/moved across my body. My groin was affected as were my armpits. They were hot and itchy. In the records you will find a phone appointment where I discussed my extensive rash. There is also a phone appointment where I discussed a very sore throat that would not relent. I believe I may have had MIS-A and my lymph glands (tonsils?) in my throat were very painful and swollen. I continued to have problems with my throat for a year. Sometimes I would have broth rather than food, it was so hard to swallow. Other times it was not as bad. The soreness, difficulty swallowing was constant but to varying degrees.   After I had the Pfizer shot, I felt the glands in my throat finally release. That was a relief to me. I felt some strange sensations on the day of the Pfizer shot. I felt a lot of activity in my brain that was very frightening. A lot of activity, electricity, nerves. I felt a sharp shard (felt like a tiny spike or piece of glass, miniscule) pass through one eye, and then the other; through one ear, and then the other; through one breast, and then the other. Both knees, both shoulders and my wrist where I had carpal tunnel surgery flared some although that passed fairly quickly.   The glands in my throat (my tonsils?) are doing so much better. This is a relief because it was a difficult problem for which I had no solution. I was gargling with mouthwash, with salt water, and using cough drops. Sometimes, with the mask-wearing in the supermarket, it was very difficult to breathe. My plan was to get vaccinated and then ask for a referral to get the throat scoped to make sure I didn't have a serious problem there.  I have had pain in my ears off and on since the shot. I wonder if the problem I am having with focus on the language of others (listening/conversation) has to do with something that happened in my ears. I attended a meeting for my work on March 29th and I was unable to manage. I was, of course, trying to listen carefully to the speakers but it was overwhelming for me. My mind was not able to deal with listening, concentrating, paying attention. I sat silent and still, not commenting and left at the end of 35 minutes.  April 20, 2021 I was able to have a conversation on the phone with my mother for over an hour. This was the first time since March 8th.  I felt good about it. There were other positives last week with my mind and cognition and how I was doing with my work. But, yesterday, April 19th, I found myself almost unable to work effectively most of the day. I tried this and that and my mind was just drifting. It's a very unsettling feeling, like vertigo inside and I find I cannot accomplish much because I cannot trust myself and have to check and re-check things. (I was working on paying some speakers we had to compensate for their time.) The day proceeded like this until I gave up around 4:30. An awful feeling to be ineffective. Today, I had a visit from my grandchildren and so I was very little on the computer. Just here and there. I find my mind still was rocking around some.   Later, in the nighttime I believe the brain itself was actually shaking. I am not sure, since it was night and I was unable to quite figure out what the sensation was. I was scared, since it was something I had not experienced before. I have also noticed in recent days that my head will ""itch"", not really itch, but it is tingly on the inside and I find I touch my head on the outside as if it were an itch I could scratch. It isn't unpleasant like an itch, it's more like when your hair moves�but the feeling is inside.   I am troubled about my future at work. My work is mentally demanding. I work with numbers, schedules of classes, data�plus students and professors. I help with translation, I edit and proof academic writing. My work also requires strong interpersonal skills. Listening difficulty is a major thing when it comes to meetings with colleagues.",,,,,,,,,N,03/08/2021,03/08/2021,0,"I went to Urgent Care/ER on March 12th and extensive tests were run.

She has a bruise where the shot was given, a big round bruise, she thinks that is normal. Later that night after she got the vaccine, she drank a cup of hot chocolate and her stomach started gurgling and she got very bloated. She had severe stomach cramps for two hours which ended up in a big stomach explosion, clarified as diarrhea which recovered completely the same evening.

The cramps recovered but her stomach has not recovered. She is still bloated, sometimes the bloating comes down and sometimes it stays, even if she does not eat anything. Constipation started Saturday and is still occurring a week later. She experienced pains in her kidneys, and this is the reason she went to see her doctor.

She thinks it started the night after the bad stomachache.

The metallic taste comes and goes, reports she has experienced this before. She had a serious migraine headache for several days; she is not sure if this is from the vaccine or from the weather changing. Patient was taking treatment with stool softener hoping her stomach will get better. The doctor did order an X-ray of her neck on Monday and she was found to have degenerative arthritis in her spine.

She said that since that time she had pneumonia as per her history, she has had multiple episodes and since COVID affects lungs and she was an HCP, she didn't want to be working until she could take the vaccine. She stated her niece was travelling and she called her doctor to see what he thinks. The doctor said he can't tell you what to do; it was a month or two after the vaccine. The doctor just wouldn't recommend it and said it was not a good idea. She felt awful. She would like to return to work, but she needed to know the chances of surviving because of her lungs and the pneumonia. She stated that the CDC did an investigation in 2006/2007 about this pneumonia and wondered if it was fungal. The CDC had to investigate, said it knocked out her immune system. She never had allergies until that, dyes like red and yellow, and she has all kinds of allergies after that episode. She was not sure how it affected the immune system: the pneumonia and then allergies to food, dyes, allergy meds. Patient reported history as she carried an epi pen since childhood and said her primary concern was wasps, bees, things like that and she was never without it as food, the red and yellow dyes bottom out her blood pressure.

There were no concomitant medications; reported as patient doesn't take any medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) or had not had any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine and stated she kept away from vaccines because of previous reactions she's had.

She also experienced couldn't feel some of her toes; and when she took her shoes off, the toes she couldn't feel were totally white. Patient stated that she was worried and almost didn't get the second dose. She treated the shingles on her own, and said it wasn't so much the burning but was more the itching and blisters all over her back. She used a home remedy of toothpaste for the shingles, and it dried it out and stopped the itching. The shingles were annoying, and her shirt was soaking wet from the blisters; it was awful, but not really disabling. She said that if she went out, she just had to make sure her shirt didn't get soaking we; it was annoying. She didn't go to the hospital because she knew what it was. Patient previously took epinephrine (EPIPEN) since childhood for allergies; and had intermittently took vitamin D for she periodically was really deficient in Vitamin D. On the first dose, she started noticing she couldn't feel some of her toes, and said when she took her shoes off, the toes she couldn't feel were totally white. She had never had that happen before, and she questioned if she should get the second dose or not. She then went and got it. She then started noticing her feet and fingers, her fingers were turning blue and she has pictures of that, too. She had been plagued with this since she got it, she's not saying it's from the vaccine, not 100 percent, but she's never had it and she does now.

Her fingers started after the second dose; it might have started before, but she thinks it was after the second dose. Patient stated that she would really like to see if she has any antibodies; she wondered did she mount any kind of response. The events required physician office visit as she visited the doctor due to the toe and finger discoloration, and said it took a couple of months to get an appointment because it was a specialist. The events were reported as serious medically significant but said were not disabling and she went to the doctor. Patient stated that her blood platelets have been fine and both hemoglobin and hematocrit were fine on an unknown date.

She did not have any other vaccine within four weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported possible adverse event with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Throughout the whole pandemic (1.5 years), she hadn't gotten any bloodwork until recently. She said that she had been hospitalized twice. Her first hospitalization was due to the high white blood cell count and the second hospitalization was due to blood in stool wherein they had to remove her bleeding polyp and she would not be discharge because of her high WBC count. When she talked to her blood doctor, her blood doctor told her that she had another patient with the same manifestation, but the other patient had COVID-19. The patient was not sure if she had COVID-19 in the past. She will have more blood work and she will have a biopsy of her bone marrow. In the meantime, she was wondering if it may be an adverse event from the vaccine. She also mentioned that she was part of the clinical trial for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The patient mentioned that she doesn't know as she had not done blood work since prior to COVID-19 because she hadn't gone to the doctor, so she went to the doctor very recently like at the beginning of May maybe. She guessed that just for something else and she went fasting so they can do routine blood work and incidentally she had a very high white blood cell count (in May2021) and at this point they cannot figure out what was wrong with her. She added that she was very healthy, everything came back pretty normal. She doesn't feel sick, they hospitalized her once for that and then she was hospitalized for (incomplete sentence). She had colonoscopy, she had some issue with (incomplete sentence), they repeated the colonoscopy to put the 'clamp' and then they didn't let her go from the hospital because of the high white blood cell count and so, she guessed she was kind of wondering, if there have been a report on abnormal blood white cell after the Pfizer vaccine and it came earliest thought in her mind today when she was at new doctor who told her about another patient that have high white blood cell count but she had COVID. The patient did not have COVID that she knows, she did not have COVID. The patient added she does not consider it a bad reaction. She mentioned that she was tired. She had undergone multiple blood tests. White blood cell count has been like from 24 to 26 all the way up to like 33. She added that when she originally went to the doctor and when she got this blood work done the first one she was having a little tiny bit of rectal bleeding in her stool and that was because she went to the doctor and she did have a colonoscopy and they basically found some internal hemorrhage as well the follicles and the second time she repeated the blood work, the third time actually she started bleeding pretty bad, so she had to repeat colonoscopy  so because of all of this trauma her doctor was repeating  the white blood 'sheet' to take blood 'today' to look at her white blood cell a little bit more in depth now that her body was kind of healed for those colonoscopy. She mentioned that now, all this medical test if there was a possibility for her to find out if it could have to do with the vaccine.

The clinic assistant that administered the vaccine  accidentally prepared the vaccine with 0.18 mL of diluent (as opposed to the required 1.8 mL) and then proceeded to administer 0.3 mL of this concentrated preparation. This resulted in  the patient receiving a higher-than-authorized dose of Pfizer-- just under 6 doses. This error was caught within a few minutes after administration because a different staff member was drawing up a dose of Pfizer from that vial and realized there was not enough left in the vial, even though only 1 dose was recorded on the vial. This staff member immediately realized there was likely an error in the preparation and informed me. I had the staff member that prepared the vaccine walk me through the process they used and we realized her error of only adding 0.18 mL of diluent.  Per CDC  COVID-19 Vaccine Administration Errors and Deviation guidelines, the patient and her mother were immediately notified  of the error and the potential for adverse side effects, a report was made internally, and another health authority was contacted to verify the correct way to enter the error in the system. The patient was  kept in office for observation for 30 minutes post vaccination. The mother of the patient and the patient asked to leave once the 30 minutes was up as the patient denied symptoms.

An attending nurse completed various tests ruling out emergency treatment at that time, indicating I should see advice from my Primary Care Physician if side affects persisted the next day.  The following day, the numbing/tingling expanded from the top of my head, all the way down the left side of my face, neck, arm, hand, lower leg and foot.  I was seen by my Primary Care Physician who directed me  immediately to the Emergency Room of Medical Center, as he thought I could be having a stroke or have a blood clot due to the affects of the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine. With my symptoms continuing and worsening and blood pressure extremely high, I had blood drawn, was given an EKG and a CT Scan in the ER.  A neurologist was also consulted who indicated my symptoms heard of after the vaccine but never seen in person.  I was referred by the attending ER Physician, Dr., to follow up with the neurologist, Dr., and was given an appointment for Friday, April 23. 2021.  I was evaluated, then scheduled and received a brain MRI with and without contrast on Wednesday, April 28, 2021.  Tests given at the time in the ER and with the neurologist appeared to show no signs of a stroke, lesions, masses or a heart attack.  The numbing/tingling continued with my left arm, leg and foot continuously for two weeks and moved around to other parts of my body for shorter periods of time during the duration.  After the two weeks, the numbing/tingling sensation appears and disappears quickly (within 30 seconds) in my left arm/hand and left foot.  This does not occur every day but still happens very sporadically.  Note:  The numbing/tingling sensation I felt within my head/face/neck area was consistent with the feeling of receiving novocaine. Please Note:  Approximately 30 minutes after my first Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a numb/tingling in my tongue with slight discomfort and the sensation I had eaten something very acidic.   I experience the same sensation at times after eating tomatoes or oranges.   I could feel my uvula when swallowing and drank a tremendous amount of water.  My throat did not close, nor did I have difficulty breathing.  I took a Benadryl tablet before bedtime, and the sensation was gone the next morning.  I mentioned this affect before receiving my second dose of the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine.

They found in my bloodwork that I was very hyperthyroid with nearly undetectable TSH levels and very high T3 and T4.  I was not symptomatic at the time of the initial bloodwork, the only thing I had noticed from the day of my vaccine through the following week was that my resting heart rate had skyrocketed from an average of high 50s to 60bpm to 80+.  By March 18th, I had started to feel intense heart palpitations, sweating, shakiness, and dizziness. Further testing found that I had subacute thyroiditis likely caused by the COVID vaccine.  I ended up going very hypothyroid with high TSH levels a month after the initial testing and am currently on levothyroxine hoping for a full recovery of my thryoid function.  The reason for concluding the vaccine was likely the cause was that I have no history of thyroid issues, had not been recently ill with anything, and it had been 1.5 years since I last had my baby.  I had last had my thyroid tested October 2020 with my OBGYN as part of her routine checks and had normal TSH levels then.  The timing and events led us to conclude the vaccine was likely the cause of the thyroiditis.  I ended up delaying my second dose for six weeks due to the unknown status of my thyroid at the time.

I was then referred to an endocrinologist, Dr. with Endocrinology. She found I had an enlarged thyroid gland, and it was painful to touch. She did more bloodwork on March 25 and found antibodies for Graves disease were negative so she referred me for a thyroid uptake/scan.  I had the thyroid uptake/scan done on April 6 and it was found that my uptake was very low. This led Nurse to diagnose me with subacute thyroiditis. On May 10, I had my next appointment with her and did more bloodwork where she found I now had very high TSH and low T3 and T4 making me hypothyroid.

1422315,06/23/2021,MI,37.0,37,,F,,"I was diagnosed with Lupus at 10 years old and experienced many symptoms between ages 10-20. In my early 20's, my symptoms lessened and I had not had a flare in over 15 years.  The first day after vaccination, mild soreness in my left arm...no big deal, just a vaccine.  By the third day after my vaccination, I realized I was having pain in multiple joints, left wrist, hand and shoulder.  As the days passed, the pain and swelling in my joints continued and spread throughout my entire body.  I tried to wait in out in hopes the issues would resolve themselves.  Finally, after 6 weeks, I realized I was having a flare and made an appointment with my doctor who said she had other autoimmune patients experience the same thing but since it had been so long, she could prescribe steroids (which I had used during other lupus flares in my childhood) and that should resolve things.  I have since had 4 rounds of steroids of varying doses and am on hydroxychloroquine but, as soon as the steroid round ends, the pain and swelling increase again.  I cannot open bottles, have difficulty sleeping due to pain, cannot perform many of my duties at work and am overall able to do minimal physical activity.  My knuckles have turned into dimples and my fingers are 2 ring sizes larger than normal.  Prescriptions listed below.  This is the most expensive free vaccine I've ever received and also has had the most negative impact.  I sincerely hope we can stop the Lupus which remained dormant for the last 15 years before vaccination.  This has the potential to have major long term health impacts.  4/29/21: 20mg prednisone for 4 days, 10 mg for 3 days 5/10/21: 20mg prednisone for 4 days, 10 mg for 3 days 5/28/21: 40mg prednisone for 5 days 6/8/21: 5mg prednisone for 14 days",,,,,,,,,N,03/14/2021,03/17/2021,3,"Sed rate 59mm/hr on 5/28/21, after 2 rounds of steroids",PHM,,Synthroid Ibuprofen,None,Lupus (SLE),,,2,06/23/2021,,Y,,None
