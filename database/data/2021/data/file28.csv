No facial droop or one-sided weakness was observed.  The patient had a history of hypertension and history of an adverse reaction to albuterol in November 2020.   The patient described being nervous to get the vaccine due to her previous reaction to alberterol which had the similar effects as today's.    The patient's new tremor worsened, and speech became more slurred and stuttered while we observed her.  The patient denied any pain and described a similar event that caused her to be hospitalized for a week with no definitive diagnosis.  Her primary care doctor had cleared her to get the vaccine.    Her Vitals were as follows: BP 160/90. HR 65, RR 20. Heart sounds were regular with occasional PVC's. Lung sounds were clear No visible rash on neck, trunk or injection site. Capillary refill was normal.  Mild edema in both lower extremities. No swelling of the lips. No visible droop in facial muscles. Patient was tearful and struggled to speak.  She repeatedly said she was tired.  She reported nausea.  EMT was called and found similar vitals and O2 saturation at 100% on room air by pulse ox.  O2 via nasal canula was begun.  Rhythm strip showed NSR.  Patient refused transport to the hospital for further evaluation.  She was informed of a possible Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) could be occurring which could need a blood thinner and further work up.    Patient was tearful saying her previous hospitalization was traumatic and did not want to return.  EMS offered her transport to another hospital facility via private vehicle, and she refused.  We offered to contact her primary care doctor and she also refused.  She was concerned about the cost of a hospital stay if she signed out AMA.  EMS left the facility and offered to return if the patient changed her mind.  The patient's symptoms had not resolved by 4:30pm.  The patient's son, by phone, confirmed she would be monitored until 5pm.   She was driven home by one of our staffers. The next day, the patient told our staffer that she felt well.

No history of vaccine allergies or allergies to any component of the COVID vaccine. Does have history of allergic reactions including hives, angioedema or anaphylaxis to some medications (neomycin, Neosporin, bacitracin) and environmental allergens (yellow jackets, fir trees). Patient reported previously daily use of diphenhydramine (2 caps every morning) and kept an epi-pen on hand. The afternoon of 2/26/21, patient presented to his neighbor's house requesting assistance with an epi-pen. Neighbor reported significant swelling around tongue and lips, and ability to faintly speak. Neighbor administered epi-pen, but unsure if it worked, so administered a 2nd epi-pen. Within a minute or two after the 2nd dose, patient slumped over and became non-responsive. EMS was called and neighbor began CPR. EMS reported that patient was non-responsive upon arrival. A King airway was placed and a Lucas device used for chest compressions. Three rounds of epinephrine were administered during transport to the local emergency room. Patient remained unresponsive with evidence of PEA during transport. Arrival at the ER occurred ~ 4:25pm. On arrival patient noted to be unresponsive with CPR in progress. Dose of epinephrine administered ~ 3 minutes after arrival in ER. No femoral pulse palpable, cardiac monitor did show some electrical activity. Evaluation of oral cavity showed significant swelling of tongue. Additional dose of epinephrine given.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is ""sulfa dioxide"" in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to ""sulfanized compounds"". She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from ""most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine"" and also from what Pfizer second line told her ""the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system"". She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn't normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn't constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn't know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn't take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that's not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn't know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn't seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn't have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn't realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.

It was reported that after getting the first dose of the vaccine the patient noticed she had pustules across her back on an unspecified date. The patient stated she ""got this rash from the tips of fingers, even the palm of my hands and it starts right under the neck and goes across my breast, on my belly, on my back and both arms and is now halfway down my shin bone."" On an unspecified date in Jan2021, she noticed this the afternoon of her vaccine around 7:00 when she saw two splotches on her stomach and it kept spreading. Sunday morning she went to Quick Care and yesterday went to her regular doctor. Her doctor gave her prednisone to take 10 mg 4 times a day, and hydroxyzine 10 mg for itching. In her throat she was getting hoarse on an unspecified date and was keeping a water bottle on her desk to keep hydrated. She stated she read on (website) that a rash can be a symptom of the vaccine. The caller asked, ""if the pustules burst will this cause anyone to get Covid 19? Is this a possible side effect of the vaccine? How long will this last? Is it okay to get my second shot with this reaction? Is there anything I should be taking to make it go away?"" It was further reported that patient received paperwork to call if there was any type of reaction. The patient mentioned she has a rash that was all over her body on 28Jan2021. It was on the top of her hands, in the palm of her hands, on her arms, back, under her breast, on her chest, on her stomach, on her bottom end, it was going down her legs and to her knees at this point. The patient initially stated she noticed the rash on Friday (29Jan2021), she later stated it was Thursday 28Jan2021 when the rash first started. She stated she first noticed splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist on an unspecified date in Jan2021. At first when looking at it she did not think too much about it. Later in the call she further clarified and stated it was possible she noticed these splotches the same day in the evening on the day she got the vaccine. She was not sure. If it was not the same day it was the next day. Friday (29Jan2021), she started to get as initially stated bumps, but later clarified rash under skin and it really proceeded from there. Additionally, it was reported that the rash continued to spread throughout her whole body. It was down to her shin now. Her whole upper body was horrible. She has some across her back. There are pustules on them like a pimple. It was like water in it ready to break. Sunday she went to a (clinic name) to get it looked at. She went Sunday 31Jan2021. She was given an intravenous (IV) and three needles were placed in it. She knows one was a steroid, she does not know what the other two were for, but she thinks one was probably for itching.

The itching was with the rash on 28Jan2021. The itching and rash has continued to go down her body. It was on her buttocks now. It was hard to sit. It was in private up between her legs and stuff. Her body was almost 80 % full and covered with this stuff. She saw her regular doctor yesterday. The doctor at (clinic name) thought this reaction may have been an allergic reaction to a Sulfa drug she was taking for a bladder infection coincidentally at the same time, but she does not believe this was the case. Stated she had taken that sulfa drug before previously. She does not have the name of the drug to provide of the sulfa drug. She does not have it with her. No blood work was done. She was just looked at. They saw what was going on. The patient also mentioned she went on the internet to do research. She saw on Pfizer page three pictures that resembled what she had going on. It was also reported that the two splotches on right hand side started about 7'clock in the evening. At first did not think anything of it. Thought it was possibly a bug bite at first. Additionally, it was reported that patient went to see a doctor. She was already going to the doctor for a bone density scan and she showed the doctor what was going on at the same time. Her primary doctor thought this was due to the COVID 19 Vaccine. At end of call, patient questioned ""if the pustules across upper back and behind neck, will that cause anyone to get COVID 19?

A 77-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm on 01Feb2021 at 09:10 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breathing problems and COVID-19 on 31Oct2020 in which she waited exactly 90 days to get the vaccine. The patient had a small touch of pneumonia on her lower lobe of her right lung, she was on a lot of antibiotics and a strong herbal solution. She was on one antibiotic for 5 days and another for 7 days. She was on the herbal stuff for 7 days. She took all that stuff and was drinking lemon juice and hot water and breathing in lemon scent and Vicks Salve all in her nose. She also was prescribed an asthma pump. She had all that stuff going into her system. She also was tested, and she has H. Pylori bacteria. She explained her whole family must have that, it's hereditary. That wasn't her issue. However, all that she put in her stomach and in her system caused her to have stomach issues. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick. She told the person administering the vaccine that antibiotics made her sick and she was told it didn't matter and that this wouldn't interfere with the COVID-19 vaccine. Her stomach was all messed from all that stuff. The patient also has anxiety. She has never been treated with anxiety. She has had anxiety since she was a very young women and she has never been treated for it. When probed for any product information she had available for the medications that messed her stomach up and made her sick she provided the following information: The first medication she took was azithromycin (Z-PAK, lot number: KG0706, expiration date: Nov2021, NDC number: 0781-8089-26) that was dispensed in a little box. Dose was 250 mg which she took daily doses for 5 days. One of the doctors gave her a levofloxacin 50 mg for 7 days. She was given the pump, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL SULFATE HFA INHALATION AEROSOL, lot number: 102B4, expiration data: 20Jan2022) 90mcg per actuation. She explained she only took this once. She was so scared from this stuff. It squirted down her mouth. Another doctor prescribed her omeprazole 40 mg capsule every day because she told him her stomach was messed up. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet, by mouth three times daily for 14 days and clarithromycin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet by mouth twice daily for 14 days. The new doctor also had her taking omeprazole (the doctor wrote another prescription for this). However, this time the dose was 20 mg and she was prescribed to take that twice daily for 14 days. She didn't finish this medication. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick and the doctor explained because of her bacteria, she ordered the antibiotics to make her feel better. The patient told the doctor if she could live like this, let her not take these medications until she gets her stomach better and she would eat healthy food and find natural antibiotics at the health food store. She mentioned using oregano. She took that once a day. When she knew she was getting ready to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she stopped taking that 2 weeks before taking the vaccine. She stopped taking cholesterol medicine at night 2 weeks ago, it was making her sick to her stomach. She stopped her potassium medicine. She didn't want any of the medicines interfering with the vaccine. The patient also took an herbal medicine that was called a Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, Elevation Science of Eternal Life. It's a detox mixture that was very strong. She took this for 7 days. She had lost weight because she was not eating. The patient has always been a junk food eater. She quit eating junk food and that probably also had something to do with her being sick. She cooks all her food. There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date with COVID-vaccine. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She has never had a flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine or shingles vaccine. This was her very first vaccine. Concomitant medication was reported as none. The patient didn't know if it was anything serious, but she tried to read all the information that was given to her. She was looking at the information and she saw ""if you have any difficulty breathing"". That was the only one that she was having. She could breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested. She was calling to see if this was anything serious and if she needed to go the emergency room. Since her breathing has been acting funny, she has been trying to keep moving around. She was cleaning her bathroom and the Bleach Cleaner and other cleaner opened her nose. She was listening to a town hall meeting and when she sat down to listen to it, her nose started stuffing up again. She has just been trying to get up and move around. Since she has been talking on the phone, her breathing was a little better. Her nose just swells. She got up and was beginning to eat breakfast when all of a sudden, the difficulty breathing started happening. It was around 8:45 am this morning (02Feb2021). It has improved, but when she would sit down, it would tighten up and she would have congestion in her chest. Since she has been moving around talking, it has gotten better. Sitting down has something to do with the difficulty breathing. She has had breathing problems before. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, 01Feb2021. She sat for half an hour afterwards and then came home. She then slept all night and stated her arm was sore on Feb2021, but it was feeling better. She also had a little pain in her right leg on the side she received her vaccine on Feb2021, which was currently gone. She wasn't sure if the breathing problems were from the vaccine or something else. The patient did not go to the emergency room or visited his physician in response to the events. She mentioned that if this continues, she probably will go to urgent care. The outcome of the event dyspnea at rest and respiratory tract congestion was recovering, recovered on Feb2021 for pain in extremity, and unknown for all other events.",,,,,,,,,N,02/01/2021,02/01/2021,0,Test Name: test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:H.pylori; Test Name: Weight; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Lost,UNK,,,,"Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Anxiety; Bacterial infection due to helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) (She explains her whole family must have that, its hereditary.); Breathing difficult; COVID-19; Gastric disorder; Lost weight; Pneumonia",,USPFIZER INC2021107029,2,03/04/2021,,,,

The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7�. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time.

Then, a week after the second shot, I got the worst fatigue I can ever remember, except maybe when I was pregnant, starting the evening of March 1. When I awoke on March 2, my body aches were so intense, I felt like I couldn't move out of bed. Then during the day, I tried to take my usual outdoor walk - usually ~ 5 miles/day. I had to turn around part-way because I was so exhausted and my legs felt both like concrete and like they were quaking from tiredness. Later that afternoon, I  fell asleep sitting up in my chair SIX times, even though I almost NEVER take a nap! I kept doubting myself because I haven't read about delayed onset of symptoms, but we don't go anywhere indoors at all except for getting the shot at the pharmacy and an MD clinic appointment now and then. (I did have an annual MD appointment on March 2, so was in the clinic that very day, using all precautions. I don't imagine I could have gotten ill instantly from something at the clinic though?) In ensuing days, I continued to feel super-fatigued, but have had more energy each day, to the point where, now, 6 days later, I feel ""almost"" like myself. I'm still unsure of walking the full 5 miles without getting too tired, and certain body aches are still hanging on (knee, wrists, fingers), but I'm otherwise feeling good. If I had the symptoms right after the shot, I would have been sure it was from the shot, but since it was delayed a week, I was uneasy and it felt a bit scary because I felt so unlike my healthy, spry, active, motivated self.   One other odd thing, that may be totally unrelated, but just in case - on the very day of the second shot, I got a huge stye on my left eye - something I haven't had in decades. It has still not gone away after 2 weeks. Just in case you get other reports, I am letting you know about this as well.

He has been given shingles (vaccine), pneumonia flu vaccines and this [transverse myelitis] happened several years after the swine flu; maybe it laid dormant and then reacted but he has been iffy of this as a possible answer. His wife seemed to think he received a flu shot prior to getting this diagnosis. The shot [flu vaccine] he remembered having was close to a year prior to this. It was a good distance of time before this diagnosis and he had no symptoms at least a year post vaccination. His wife seemed to think it was correlated but he did not. He can never receive a flu shot again because originally he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome on an unknown date and then later it was changed to transverse myelitis (1997). He stated it seemed to be more anomalous, a very fine number that had contracted GBS from the swine flu shot but ""they"" had to post it and that was why he cannot get a flu shot. He stated he supposed this reaction would be considered an allergic type of reaction (date unknown) . He asked if there was any data on this and asked on the way this vaccine was developed different from the flu shot. He asked why he can get a shingles shot and not this (covid vaccine). He stated he only has mild flu like symptoms with the shingles vaccine. He asked if this covid vaccine structured the same way as the flu shot. He stated understanding this was beyond his understanding. It was explained that agent was unbale to compare the ingredients/chemical structure of the flu shot or shingles shot with this Covid vaccine and was provided with instructions on how to access the prescribing information so that he can have more information about the ingredients and chemical structure and other details he may be interested in writing and can compare it with other vaccines he is interested in looking into. Patient was referred to HCP to assist with this comparison. The outcome of the events Guillain-Barre Syndrome, transverse myelitis and allergic type of reaction was unknown.

Also, my left arm was red, not swollen at the injection site and hurt to touch, not as bad as the 2 days after receiving the vaccine, but I thought it was unusual that my arm was red & sore. This is what made me conclude it was a delayed reaction to the vaccine. I rarely have headaches and if I do  taking 2 Ibuprofen will take care of it. Taking 2 Ibuprofen this time did absolutely nothing to ease the pain.  I did increase to 800 mg of Ibuprofen late Friday and early Saturday which did help, used a cervical heating pad, hot shower to try to ease muscle tension. I was able to sleep and by Saturday evening with home remedies, the pain did subside and by Sunday March 7,2021 I felt back to normal with a slight, slight bit of headache but not much to worry about.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/25/2021,03/05/2021,8,None,OTH,,Atorvastatin 10 mg once per day,None,None,,,2,03/08/2021,,,,Medicatins-Ampicillin

Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen.

There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I'm dark skinned].  Still just can't seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It's still pretty early on. I'm not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.

The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days. He does not remember exactly when this ended. He did not take anything for the localized pain and soreness in the same area as the injection. He confirmed he has recovered completely from this event. Caller further clarified the feeling of anxiousness started Thursday or Friday of last week, maybe 05Feb2021. Stated it was like this feeling is getting worse and worse. Stated it was hard to explain, but he started to feel a goosebumps tingly sensation in his brain in head, in scalp Thursday of last week first.

Also, along with that feeling at the same time his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won't work anymore to bring it down. His blood pressure typically ranges in the 130/85 or less range with all the blood pressure medications he was taking. Once he started having this tingling sensation in his head he had the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate. Now his blood pressure would average being about 170/110 to 180/115. This was like the upper and lower range. His heart rate was typically around 70-75 and now it goes about 80-85. Later during call, he also added, every six months or so his blood pressure may be elevated on these medications. Sometimes his blood pressure was not maintained by the three different blood pressure medications he takes. He was also prescribed two other medications for emergent use Clonidine and Xanax. Usually every six months he would have to take Clonidine and Xanax and typically in an hour to two hours the blood pressure would come down and it's good. However, this time, he took two Clonidine and Xanax starting last Thursday when had the high blood pressure episode and they were failing to bring the blood pressure down. He further explained it would bring it down for some time, but then it would go back high. The Clonidine is no longer working for the last six days.

By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system's reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.

He is currently in a facility.  He received a vaccination there.  He states that he felt lightheaded afterwards and then is reported to have passed out and had shaking, total body shaking episode lasting approximately 30 seconds.  30 seconds later he was alert and talking.  He did not bite his tongue or have or have incontinence.  This is similar to prior episodes of vaccinations and painful procedures like dental procedures.  He has otherwise been well.  No hives, difficulty breathing, lip or tongue swelling, vomiting, diarrhea at this time.  I do not appreciate signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis while you are in the emergency department however the story conveyed to me from the facility sounds consistent with anaphylaxis.  For this reason you should not receive the second COVID vaccination.  Your story sounds most consistent with fainting after a shot.  I do not believe that you are actually having seizures.  It is common to have shaking episodes when people faint.  Make sure that you are sitting down or lying down for all further vaccinations.""",,,,,,,,,Y,03/07/2021,03/07/2021,0,,OTH,,None,,Substance abuse,,,2,03/08/2021,,,Y,No known drug allergies

She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.

On the eighth day (03Feb2021) she had a reaction where her right hand and wrist was painful and swollen. Caller states she couldn't move her hand without pain. Caller states she put ice on her hand Wednesday evening and this helped a little.  When ice was on her hand it helped with the pain but when it was removed it came back. She also reported fingers on right were all swollen and that she does have arthritis.  She further described the events as on Wednesday she started getting a little pain in her right wrist joint. She does have arthritis, but this pain was stronger, and her hand and fingers on right were all swollen in comparison to her other hand, and her knuckles seemed bigger. States that the pain got very strong and by the next morning she could barely move her arm; even though it was only her wrist that hurt, moving any part of her arm made her wrist her more, so she started icing it and took Tylenol for Arthritis 650mg Extended Release; she took it twice, one each time and reported that it probably didn't work. Caller clarifies statement about it probably not working; stating that she didn't notice a difference after taking the Tylenol.  She asked if these events, occurring eight days after the vaccine could be vaccine side effects or is this just a flare up on her arthritis that is unrelated to the vaccine. She added that she had been doing a lot of ""chopping"" while cooking on the night that this happened so that may have caused the flare up. She has a Medrol pack on hand for things like this (4mg tablets). She started it today and took two tablets before breakfast and one tablet at lunch. She states that it has already made a difference in her pain. She stated her concern, however, which is that she found that taking a steroid could affect the vaccine if taken before getting the vaccine, and right now she is in-between the two doses.

The patient took the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and after about 2-4 days (Jan2021), she had a little chill and got very tired. She had to take care of herself. She was very tired not realizing it was the shot she took. She also felt like she has no energy. The patient was working from home but a lot of times, she was lying on the couch. Over the weekend (Jan2021), she had a slight pain on left arm. About a week or 8-10 days later (2021), she got very tired and couldn't even sit up. Her body was not itself. She started to feel like a bus rolling over her, like somebody took a baseball bat and beat her really bad. The patient uses her arm a lot and her hand started to feel a lot of pain. She couldn't even touch herself; it was so sensitive. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL) but it didn't work. She had celecoxib (CELEBREX) an anti-inflammatory, she thought she was maybe inflamed, but it didn't work. She had some diclofenac cream, she rubbed it, but it didn't work. The patient had shingles about a year and a half ago which was very bad. She just felt weak and didn't feel like herself anymore. She had a little bit of nausea and her whole body was really terrible. When she had the shingles, it left her with severe pain in both legs. She saw a neurologist and told her that she would have to take pregabalin (LYRICA) and it would go away. So, when she had severe pain last week, she took pregabalin but it didn't help. The patient took half of acetaminophen, oxycodone (PERCOCET) as she was not the person who takes pills, but it didn't work. Her body was so severe on Friday, it was not going away, the pain was there 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing this for 8-10 days now. She took one PERCOCET on Friday and had a slight relief and didn't took anything again. She kept rubbing the diclofenac cream, but it was not much of a relief.

She asked how she will feel after the second dose if she felt that way after the first dose, if the first shot was adequate, and if she should take the second dose. She stated that she didn't want to take the second dose. Her body felt so weak including her fingers and hand. It triggered the shingles pain in her back and felt like she was beaten up by someone. She has to lie down for the pain in her back. She also mentioned that she couldn't sit for so long as her waist and back were so painful. She was lying on a heating pad and ice and nothing was working. She even has a hard time getting up. She thought what happened was it triggered the shingles pain in her back and also left her with a problem under her feet. The shingles left her with some kind of damage when she took the shot. It was really bad. Her son was a physician and was concerned because last week, it got so bad, she didn't come out, she was in bed and bedridden from Friday to Sunday. She had no appetite, she didn't eat. The only thing that the patient had was diabetes and high blood pressure, but it was under control.

Went to my doctor on March 2nd - my doctor thought I was having a histamine response in my body. I took an antihistamine - and half my symptoms went away. My esophagus is going into spasms -  and I am trying to see a GI specialist. I was taking Benadryl last week but I got too tired. So I take 2 Benadryl at night now and I'm taking a Zyrtec (generic) at the day - it takes the edge off but doesn't resolve the symptoms entirely. Eleven day - I developed a floaty in my right eye - a black spot. I went to my eye doctor - it looks like my eye is healthy -but floaty is not going away. So talking on the phone, My throat is starting to swell up and feels like something back there and the more I talk pretty soon I start losing my voice (happening now on the phone). They added to my meds: Pepsid, Viscus lidocaine;  Mylanta after every meal; Pantoprazole;  Sucralfate; gave me another one but I haven't taken it yet: Hyoscyamine - for really bad spasms and I haven't had another really bad one since I went to ER (besides taking the antihistamines).

I was having difficulty breathing through my mask and asked employee if they had a mask I can have.  When I took mine off to use theirs, I was surprised it wasn't my usual KN95 on me as those are more difficult to breath through.  I felt labored in breathing from that point.  I left the store to get home quickly.  I was also experiencing rapid heart rate\great nervousness and was assuming that because I purchased a large diet coke one hr before that, that the caffeine was causing this.  However, I've never experienced this event.  Within 3 minutes of my home, I started experiencing what seemed to be shortness of breathe.  it lasted about a minute.  I considered going to ER.  But went home.  Shortness of breathe stopped and I looked on google how to reduce caffeine reaction.  I ate handful of peanuts for protein, but had odd indigestion.  Kept drinking lots of water to flush out.  Was doing many deep breathing exercises. Nervousness and rapid heart rate lasted about 2 hours.  I  was back to normal by evening.
