Tuesday night my stomach was a bit itchy and my back.  I didn't think anything of it.  Wednesday morning I woke up with a rash on my chest, back and stomach.  I came to work (not listed on the symptom checker) called health clinic; spoke with an employee; he said that is too far out after the vaccination to have had a reaction to it.  He told me to watch the rash and then call my PCP if it gets worse. I know 2 other people who also got a rash; however, 1 was just at the injection site and the other 1 was down the same arm as the injection site (all not my family).  I'm not sure I want to receive the 2nd vaccine.  An itchy rash over my body; if associated with the vaccine, seems fairly mild/moderate.  I continue to hear that patients have increased symptoms after their 2nd dose.  I'm not sure, at this point, what is related to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or if the vaccine just heightened some of my CFS symptoms (Dizziness, nausea and eye focus).  I did have some increased dizziness and nausea about 20 minutes after the vaccine but they didn't bother me too much at the time. I have not changed soap, ate anything out of the ordinary or purchased any clothes or sheets or anything that would touch my skin to cause this type of reaction. That afternoon (Wednesday Jan 13th) I was itching much worse.  Mostly my stomach and chest.  I left work a bit early to get some Benadryl and Cortisone cream.  I took the Benadryl right away and rubbed cortisone on my chest and stomach. This did not help much at all.  I was very itchy and uncomfortable. I decided to shower (that was awful), went back to a store and then got Brand Name Cortisone cream (just in case).  This also did not help.  I was up until, at lease, 2 am trying not to scratch.  I rubbed cortisone on over and over and just couldn't lay still.  I was bruised on my chest and stomach from scratching and rubbing. I was going to go to the walk in clinic Thursday morning.  I woke up and the rash was a little better. However, it was still itchy (not as bad as the night before) and having clothes touching my skin hurt.  I did not go to the walk in clinic. I did some work from home.  Thursday night the rash had traveled down onto my thighs, though my legs didn't severely itch; just my chest and stomach.  I still couldn't put on clothes Friday either and my legs were sensitive to things rubbing on them but not itchy.  Saturday was normal and normal life.  Sunday, I woke up and was still tired. I took a nap for about an hour; then another nap a few hours later for 2 hours; and then I was falling asleep sitting up in my chair so I went to be around 8:30 pm and woke up late today (Monday Jan 18th) at about 7:45 am.

About 36 hours later injection site was so painful that it resulted in nausea, waking during the night, unable to perform ADLs, having to seek orthopedic physicians care for evaluation and meloxicam daily.  Pain has persisted beyond 3 weeks post injection.  I received a referral for physical therapy.  I am still struggling with pain that continues to wake me during the night.  I am a 55 year old female who has delivered three children and I would describe this pain at injection site from three weeks ago as the most pain I have ver experienced in my life time.  Pain still remains at injection site and radiates to the shoulder joint and up into the neck.  Currently receiving  physical therapy treatment for the pain and discomfort.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27.

All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender's Comments: The event ""Nerve Injury"" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event ""Nerve Injury"" to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.

I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn't feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out.

So this isn't entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn't too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn't 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel ""down for the count.""  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).

It is always present but not as noticeable during the day when there is noise in the surrounding area, however, my job requires a lot of report writing and for that I work in silence. Therefore, the ringing sound is very distracting and makes it hard to focus. I saw my general practitioner, on January 14th at 4:15 p.m.. She cleaned out my right ear and started me on a 6-day steroid. She did not clean out the left ear because it did not appear to have any wax buildup. I began taking the steroid on Saturday January 16th. The ringing is still there but it does seem to be more on my left side than my right now.

They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob.

Critical care was necessary to treat or prevent imminent or life-threatening deterioration of the following conditions: cardiac failure, circulatory failure, CNS failure or compromise, dehydration, hepatic failure, endocrine crisis, metabolic crisis, renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, shock, toxidrome and trauma.  I provided critical care services requiring my management in the following manner: chart data review, documentation time, medication orders and management, re-evaluations, vital signs assessments and reviewing monitor data, and ordering and reviewing lab tests.  Aggregate Critical care time was 30 minutes.  My time did not include minutes spent treating any other patient simultaneously or on activities that did not directly contribute to the patient's treatment.  It did not include time spent performing other reported procedures.  Medical Decision Making:  This is a 76-year-old female who presented ER today for evaluation of syncope.  Patient was reportedly mildly hypotensive which improved with IV fluids.  I suspect that patient had dehydration given 4 episodes of large watery stools.  Patient had no recent antibiotic use and has no C. difficile risk factors, suspect this may be related to her Covid vaccine, she had no evidence to suggest anaphylactic shock, patient felt better after IV fluid bolus was able to ambulate around the emergency department without lightheadedness or near syncope.  She had troponins x2 which were negative, her EKG was nonischemic and there was no evidence of ectopy or arrhythmia.  Patient did have syncope and fell onto her side, she denies discrete head injury although patient is anticoagulated, CT head was obtained to rule out intracranial hemorrhage given the syncopal event.  Patient CT abd/pelvix was negative for obvious cause of patient's abdominal tenderness may be related to her diarrheal illness patient will be prescribed Bentyl.  She will call her primary care doctor in the morning to arrange close follow-up.  She understands need for aggressive oral hydration at home.  She will have low threshold to return should she develop lightheadedness syncope chest pain shortness of breath palpitations worsening abdominal pain bloody or dark stools any new or concerning symptoms.  The patient presented to the emergency department with potentially life or limb-threatening symptoms.      After my history, examination, and workup have decided that the patient is stable.    My impression is that they are safe to go home at this time.  I have reviewed ED return precautions with the patient. They understand to return if they are concerned for any reason.   They will follow-up with their PCP in 1-2 days.        Impression:  Syncope, hypotension�improved, dehydration  Plan:   Discharge   Follow Up    Within: 1-2 days    Comments: Please call your doctor in the morning to arrange follow-up with your primary care doctor in the next 24 hours.  Please stay well-hydrated and eat regular meals.  Please take Bentyl as needed for abdominal cramping with diarrhea.  Please return to the ER if you develop worsening abdominal pain, feelings of lightheadedness passing out any new or concerning symptoms.    Patient Education  Syncope, Easy-to-Read  Diarrhea, Adult    Discharge Meds  dicyclomine  10 mg 1 cap, PO, QID, 20 cap  Referral for suspected pre-hypertension or hypertension was given.

This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it's still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it's lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can't think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn't want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn't know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node's reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender's Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile.

I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn't take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn't have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn't drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there.

0965632,01/22/2021,LA,23.0,23,,F,,"I had 3 injections of the Gardasil Vaccine. The first dose was on 6/19/2007; second dose on 8/16/2007; third dose on 1/14/2008.  The lot number is not located on my progress notes. I do have the progress notes from my OB-GYN for proof of these injections.   Since being vaccinated with Gardasil (which was a series of 3 vaccinations), I developed irregular periods. I have suffered with infertility for several years now. Of course I did not know I was infertile until many years later when trying to conceive. My husband and I stopped using condoms in 2013. After 3 years of no success, in  2016, we decided to dig a little deeper and started testing various things. First we started with checking my husband's sperm which was fine. Then, we began testing me. During my first visit with the reproductive endocrinologist, I was told that my FSH was around 9 and my AMH was 0.065. I was told that I had a greater than 0%, but less than 5% chance of conception. The reproductive endocrinologist also told me that I had so few eggs, that I would not be a candidate for IVF. He said I had diminished ovarian reserve. He said with an AMH of 0.065, I had likely had a very low egg supply even in my mid-twenties. Shortly after, I became spontaneously pregnant (no fertility treatment), but very quickly miscarried at just a few weeks pregnant. Then I went through several years of testing, surgeries and seeing various doctors to try and figure out why I wasn't able to conceive, as I was diagnosed as having ""unexplained infertility of unknown etiology"".  Then in 2018, I became pregnant without fertility treatment.  I delivered my son.  Eleven months later after his delivery, I stopped having periods all together (May 2020). I notified my OB-GYN who did some bloodwork (estradiol and FSH) to determine if I was in perimenopause because I began having hot flashes, developed a bald spot on my head, mood swings, emotional, low libido.  One of my levels came back ""pre-menopausal"" and the other was in the menopausal range. She did a repeat bloodwork a month later  and both of my levels came back in the menopausal range. My estradiol was less than 15 and my FSH was 101 (this is at 37 years of age). She diagnosed me with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) also known as premature ovarian failure. I then went back to see a reproductive endocrinologist to get recommendations on hormone replacement therapy. The reproductive endocrinologist tested me for Fragile X and Turner syndrome and adrenal antibodies; all of these were negative. He said the cause of my POI was ""idiopathic"".  I now am on hormone replacement therapy and will have to remain on it into my 50's (I am only 37 years old).  I was also just diagnosed with hypothyroidism as my hormones are a ""wreck"". I truly feel that the Gardasil vaccine has had an impact on my life and my ability to have children. I thank God that he blessed me with a child.  Infertility has ruined my life in so many ways and now this new diagnosis of POI is having a huge impact on my life from my energy level, mood swings, libido, hot flashes and the list goes on and on.

Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn't usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn't exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn't have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.

At the end of her shift, she handed off her vaccines to another vaccinator. The PA had three doses of vaccine drawn up at that time, in syringes, on her desk. When the RN inspected the syringes, she found 0.4mL of vaccine had been drawn into those syringes rather than the required 0.3mL. The RN then alerted the lead APRN, who escalated the situation to the manager. The manager then contacted Quality.  The concern was that the PA had been vaccinating patients all morning with an inappropriate dose of vaccine, 0.4mL.  After thorough internal investigation, we found that the PA drew up 38 vaccine doses and administered 35 of them.  Additionally, based on vial usage for the day and total number of vaccines administered, we have concluded that it is highly unlikely that excess vaccine was administered.

At the end of her shift, she handed off her vaccines to another vaccinator. The PA had three doses of vaccine drawn up at that time, in syringes, on her desk. When the RN inspected the syringes, she found 0.4mL of vaccine had been drawn into those syringes rather than the required 0.3mL. The nurse then alerted the APRN, who escalated the situation to the manager. The operations manager then contacted Quality. The concern was that the PA had been vaccinating patients all morning with an inappropriate dose of vaccine, 0.4mL. After thorough internal investigation, we found that the PA drew up 38 vaccine doses and administered 35 of them. Additionally, based on vial usage for the day and total number of vaccines administered, we have concluded that it is highly unlikely that excess vaccine was administered.

At the end of her shift, she handed off her vaccines to another vaccinator (a RN). The PA had three doses of vaccine drawn up at that time, in syringes, on her desk. When the RN inspected the syringes, she found 0.4mL of vaccine had been drawn into those syringes rather than the required 0.3mL. The RN then alerted the lead APRN, who escalated the situation to the operations manager. The operations manager then contacted the Chief Quality Officer. The concern was that the PA had been vaccinating patients all morning with an inappropriate dose of vaccine, 0.4mL. After thorough internal investigation, we found that the PA drew up 38 vaccine doses and administered 35 of them. Additionally, based on vial usage for the day and total number of vaccines administered, we have concluded that it is highly unlikely that excess vaccine was administered.

This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine.

I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am).

I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a ""bad migraine"" (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more ""tired"" than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending ""bad migraine"" coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side.

The following did not link up in my head as a possible side affect until this morning. Starting with Wednesday evening I was burning up.  (I am guessing at the 5pm I reported above).   I did not have a fever.  The burning up sensation was constant until I awoke this morning (Saturday).  It is only now I can tie it in with the burning sensations I got with M.S..  Thursday during my one class I kept making mistakes where I said one thing and wrote another.  Once is an accident.  10 times is MS.  I did connect that to MS even though I have not had that issue in over 10 years.  I thought it might be due to the small amount of sleep I got Wednesday night.

Initially, I had a slight, constant  headache and ""medium"" fatigue.  I dismissed it as not important because it was relatively minor. and I am generally fatigued at the end of a work week.  The headache lasted all day but was fairly low level. I did not sleep well that night but was able to function during the next day (1/17/2021)  without a problem.  I don't remember if the headache was present that day.  However, on Sunday evening (1/17/2021) (around 6:00 p.m. or so) chills started to go up and down my body and my hands were very cold.  I had no fever.  I added more garments to keep warm and ignored or was distracted by my activities of the evening. Monday (1/18/2021) during the day the chills continued to go up and down my body  intermittently-- not really staying in one place -- but my hands remained very cold.  It should be stated that I prefer colder temperatures; i keep my house between 60-62 degrees in winter and I am able to stay comfortable with a shirt and sweater in that environment.  So, on Monday, the fact that I had chills was remarkable to me. The chills were intermittent. Tuesday (1/19/2021) I worked from home all day and had an electric heater going focused very closely on my body all day.  I was cold but don't remember having chills.  Tuesday evening the chills returned, along with a significant headache that circled my head (not focused in one spot), my body ached, my eyeballs ached; I had intestinal cramping .and I simply could not get warm due to the constant ""full-body"" chills. I went to bed with a heated mattress pad on,  flannel sheets, a comforter an d a thick wool  blanket. I could not get warm.  I was not able to sleep at all the entire night due mostly to the (major) physical discomfort and (minor) worry as to what was going on. I DID NOT have a fever. Around 8:30 on Wednesday morning, I was able to fall asleep as the chills had diminished and I was worn out. The body and eyeball aches were still present as was the intestinal cramping. Later that afternoon the symptoms started to diminish and I was able to sleep Wednesday night. I did not eat anything on Wednesday as I was not interested in food due to the discomfort of  the intestinal cramping. I was able to smell food and had not lost my sense of taste.  Thursday morning (1/21/2021,  I finally felt like I could eat and had  some food which tasted delicious to me.  I was able to get warm, had slight headache, cramping was mostly gone, ..I still had (reduced levels) body aches and eyeball aches.  I had no chills.  I was able to consume and tolerate reduced amounts of food.  Friday (1/22/2021) I was tired but able to function and felt as if I was returning to feeling like myself.  Today, Saturday(1/23/2021, I am feeling about 95% myself and relieved to have this behind me.  I am very concerned about how I might react to the second dose of the vaccine.  I am going to consult the local hospital and my PCP there to inquire about the advisability of getting the second dose.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/15/2021,01/16/2021,1,,OTH,,Atorvastation 80mg Vitamin C Vitamin D CoQ10 Vitamin B Complex Metformin,none,High Cholesterol,,,2,01/23/2021,,,,None

After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak & achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn't eat.  Wednesday night I tossed & turned all night with a chill that I couldn't lose even with the heaviest down comforter & supplementary blankets.  That night & the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn't stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn't eaten since Monday dinner so I didn't have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal & seem to have no further symptoms.

It's not urgent, I hope, but I wanted to report this (as recommended by CDC guideline). Please let me know. Thank you. They said: At this time, I would suggest to draw a line around the rash to see if it grows bigger or smaller. If it grows bigger after 1 or 2 more days, send us a message again or give us a call back. To reduce pain and discomfort where you got the shot: Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area. Use or exercise your arm. Consider Over-the-counter medicine such as Ibuprofen or Tylenol. To reduce discomfort from fever: Drink plenty of fluids. Dress lightly. It is still itchy.

Within minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel like my body was racing a little. My foot started tapping and I felt hyperactive. At the end of my 15 minute wait time, I spoke to the physician that was in the room. I told him I was having a mild reaction and asked him if it was still okay for me to get the 2nd dose. He said yes, but he also took me over to another person to give me some Benadryl, just in case it got worse. They gave me 50mg of Benadryl and asked me to wait another 15 minutes to give it a little time to kick in. My reaction kept getting worse. I started itching all over and the hyperactive feeling became worse. She offered to use an epipen. I declined and  asked to wait another 15 minutes. At the 30 minute mark after taking the Benadryl, they called their EMT team because I continued to get worse. The team took me over to the ER. While they were pushing me there, my breathing started coming faster like I was panting. As if I had just gone for a run. Once I was in the ER, a physician saw me pretty quickly but it took a while until he came back to see me. I do not know how long it was. I would guess about 45 minutes to 1 hour. While waiting for the doctor the second time, it felt like my body started slowing down. Within 10 minutes, I felt like i had no energy left. I couldn't lift my arms. I was wide awake and could understand everything. But, all I could do was lay there. The ER doctor ordered oral Prednisone, IV Pepcid & IV Benadryl to be given immediately. He sent me home with prescriptions for the Prednisone and Pepcid since I already have Benadryl.

He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad.

Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache.
