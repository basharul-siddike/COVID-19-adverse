She was at 260, and now she was 250 because she lost 10 of that. She had for 30 or 40 years (no further details provided). Concomitant medications were none. The patient got the shot and after that they did not hold her, she just left. She did not feel the injection at all, she was wondering at first if he actually gave it to her because he was very good. She went to the grocery store. She had brain surgery last year, so she was weak anyways. After having brain surgery she could shop for, like she built up to an hour, really and had no problems. She stopped for breakfast and she was fine. She got in the store and just started walking through the store. She had trouble breathing (maybe around 45 minutes to an hour after vaccination) and was leaning on the cart because she was so weird. It went away maybe the next day or the day after. She got about three things and then went to the line and got out of the store. She went home and did not remember when the spot showed up, maybe hours after before she noticed it. It was a raised spot like a bug bite on top of her left (no further details provided). She thought a spider must have bit her. Then, she went to bed and the next day she had hives all over her which were practically on top of each other. It was really bad hives and only from the knees up for some reason, none on her toes or her feet just her knees up and it was horrible. She was tired, weak, and felt ill so she stayed in bed a lot on 28Apr2021. She slept for practically the whole time the next 4 days. She went to the doctor the day after for the hives and he said it was Covid Arm. She was not sure if she was allergic to the shot itself or like a bad reaction happened here. She went in and had them check, and he searched on the internet. That was why she will not be going back to that doctor. It hurt just a little bit, no big deal. It hurt and was red around it. It was more like Covid body. She had headache on 28Apr2021 and then chills on 29Apr2021 and it was like she had the flu only she did not throw up. Chills were intermittent and on and off all day whether she was in bed or up or under a lot of covers or not. On 02May2021 she got nauseated (intermittently, a lot of nausea). She took a lot of Benadryl. She was sleeping good because she took Benadryl. She still had headaches and she woke up with it. It was kind of dull for four days. It probably came on she was going to say almost instantly but she could have been stressed about getting the shot. At the time of report it was worse than it was. She also had swelling on her face and lips on 02May2021 but she also had hives in the same spots that it was swelling. Right at the top of her forehead, and the top of her lip but she thought it may have been a hive because she had a hive on her lip and three or four on her forehead. She thought it was more than that and there was swelling because she was allergic.  Her throat did not close up. She had legs swollen on an unknown date in May2021. She did not think this had anything to do with the shot. She did not think it was from an allergic reaction on that part. She thought she was probably allergic to it because she had so many hives. She was scared to death of getting the second one. She was feeling really good when she walked in, she was walking good and everything, and she went out to eat and the store. It was quite long but truthfully when she got out of bed, she would just go to her couch. As of last night, the trouble breathing was there but she had not been up long enough to see. She was going to therapy later. She was very vivid because she was doing so much better because of the operation. She was still feeling weak but sometimes it got better and then she got weak again. Her body was compromised and everything because of her operation.  She wanted to get the shot because she did not go out many places.  Hives all over her started as a few, so she went to the doctor because it was quite a few. The next day, they were so much worse. The patient stated she sounded like she was hypochondriac. Benadryl was all she took for treatment and took it as often as the box allowed, she thought 2 every 4 to 6 hours. The events did not require ER visit. Relevant tests: none.

She is just wondering if she should follow up with a doctor or go to the hospital, because it hurts pretty bad in 3 different sections of her stomach. Her stomach feels like her arm felt when she got the shot. It feels like she had bruising, not exactly stabbing but it is pretty painful and she is kind of concerned. She doesn't know if her doctor would have information on the vaccine for what to do, and they would probably send her to the hospital. She hopes it's not something serious.

No other vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The patient received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 01Apr2021. She had fever, body ache and chills one day post vaccination (02Apr2021). The symptoms lasted until 03Apr2021. She didn't have any other symptoms until 2 weeks later. She started having an arthritis pain in her hips, knees, shoulder, and toes. The pain is quite significant. She wants to know if this is was part of an immune response to the vaccine. The worst pain she is having is on the right side. Its the same side in which she received the vaccine. Caller states she was under the care of a doctor for pain management. She was going to start getting injection maybe cortisone. She felt everything flared up. She went to the emergency room and received 2 shots of morphine. She cant even bend over she feel like going to the E.R and getting another shot of morphine to help ease the pain. A couple weeks ago, she noticed she was having some arthritis pain. She had been told in the past that she has arthritis. She had arthritis pain in her hip, knees, shoulder, and toes. She went to the emergency department and had a CAT scan and saw she had a herniated disc in her back. The emergency room thinks the herniated disc in her back was causing her back pain. All of her joints hurt. Her hip hurts so bad she can hardly take a breath. She was asking is this an arthritis flare up or an immune response from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was asking if this was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She's going to have steroid injections in her foot. She has arthritis in her big toe and she has bunions. Last week she had cellulitis in her right foot and she could hardly walk. From her neck down she hurts. She took some muscle relaxers and she's having trouble talking because of the medicine. She takes Tizanidine and Hydrocodone. She took some and her back feels better but her hip is horrible. Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 7.5mg-325mg. Take one tablet twice a day as needed.

Discard by date on pharmacy bottle is Apr 2022. She went for a follow up with her primary care provider after she went to the emergency room and her primary care doctor told her she can't do anything for her. The doctor didn't even ask her a question. That's not the first time the doctor has done that. She's looking for a new doctor. She reports two weeks ago she was able to hold her granddaughters for the first time in 14 months since the pandemic started. She reported her initial side effects of fever, body aches and chills lasted about a day then the day after on 03Apr2021, those side effects were gone. Except for a sore arm. She had a sore arm for 2 to 3 days. Her arm felt like getting a flu shot. But the next day it felt more like getting a tetanus shot. The arthritis pain has been gradual. First she noticed her thumbs would be sore and her thumbs have been fine for quite a while. Meaning, she hasn't had arthritic pain in her thumbs for a while. She woke up this morning and everything hurts. It's gotten worse. She also has pain that goes down her leg. This pain is associated with the herniated disc but she can't remember what it's called. While in the emergency department she had a CAT scan and routine blood work done. She had an MRI scan last Saturday, 01May2021. She doesn't know the results of that yet. Her pain management doctor thought she had a herniate disc. She has back pain and was told a while ago that she does have arthritis. If she aches, it's the arthritis. A week or so before she went to the emergency department she fell twice and landed on her bottom both times. She didn't have to go to the emergency department for either of her falls. She just had some bruises. She reports she's had balance problems for maybe 3 or 4 years. She reports she went to the emergency room only once and it was about 3 weeks ago. She would like to add that the worst pain she's having is on the right side of her body. Relevant Tests included blood work, CAT scan and MRI.

She lost her vision, she could not see for three days. She got a fever. It left her with a filament thing. It is just delightful. It is viral and really bad. She got it at her eye doctors office when she was there for an annual visit. She sometimes had to go there 3 times to have filament growing on her eye scrubbed off. It is wicked painful. It is quite an adventure.); she used to be three quarters but she shrunk a little; has been a couch potato for a year, it comes with the territory with lockdown and being depressed; she is immunocompromised and catches many things and is high risk She feels like a sitting duck; had issues on her palm of hands; had issues on her breasts, and chest; and various problems. Family Medical History Relevant to adverse events was none.  No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No other vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications included vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX 100) 100 as dose did not clarify units, has been on for years; hydroxyzine embonate (HYDROXYZINE PAM) Dosage 25 mg, she did not remember indication, may be allergies, if she is around a cat, she takes it prophylactically; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) low strength, 81 mg twice a week, has been on for decades, nephrologist put her on it in the 90's and She did not remember why, he said it preserves kidney function or it is good for overall health; pentoxifylline ongoing at 400 mg, 3 a day, she has been on for years, her vascular doctor prescribed; prednisone dosage:1 mg, she takes and alternates between 6 and 7 mg, If she takes lower than that, she is a ""narcoleptic"" (as reported, did not clarify); rosuvastatin Dosage:10 mg, frequency not specified, it is a nightly thing; fish oil (SUPER OMEGA 3) overall supplement that was suggested by former nephrologist at some point some; estradiol (YUVAFEM) Dosage:10 micrograms for menopause, vaginal dryness; there was no variable in her medication routine, she is on a long list of medications (she could not remember, one was blood pressure, with the last administration she was worked up and her blood pressure would not come down, she also takes Tylenol as needed), she provided the details as she knows them, but did not know full details for all of her medications. There was nothing new to her routine except like when Prilosec was taken off the market, she got a different medication for it. She has been on all of these for long term maintenance.  Historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19MAR2021 (at the age of 64-year-old)(Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) for covid-19 vaccination, adverse events following prior vaccinations: none; and flu vaccine for immunization in last fall, 2020. She has a history of obscure side effects to medication, things that people have never heard of and she is the 1 in a million that has ever had these problems. The patient previously took ondansetron (ZOFRAN), (""a chemotherapy treatment"", given before chemotherapy), which gave her a homicidal migraine and they had to give her ice packs for her head; 9 rounds of ""Cytox"" (Cytoxin or Cytoxan) she was not sure how this was spelled, and chemotherapy (9 rounds of chemo); azathioprine (IMURAN), she does not know if it was spelled Immuran or Imuran; prednisone a number of years and she said to her rheumatologist, ""it did not make sense on an intellectual basis that the prednisone being effective in her body as it was once"" and he said he would give her IMURAN which is given to kidney patients to cause less of a reaction with the organ, and patient mentioned she had barely an immune system after all these years on prednisone, she went through 3 rounds of steroids; Heparin IV, which  made her arm feel on fire on the inside, which they would not give her a flush when she had IV treatment; Dextrose IV made her skin feel hot and itchy, her mouth felt like she put something in that had been soaking in rubbing alcohol; ciprofloxacin (reported as ""Cipro""), she had a bad reaction to Cipro, she was given after she was bit by a dog on her calves, she knew it was attached to and is ""hurting her calves the rest of her life/the podiatrist said if it has not gone away, she is kind of stuck"" (as reported, not specified). The patient just wanted to give Pfizer a full picture of what she was dealing with and she is an unusual case. She added that chemo was in the 90s and that is when all of the medication reactions she mentioned were. She absolutely does not have any of the information about the products she mentioned she had previous reactions to. Every time they did ""this"", it ""hurt"" and she asked them not to do it anymore. She asked them to not do dextrose anymore with the chemo because it feels like it is on fire, and she asked them to mix it with saline. She did not have any additional information, did not have the NDC, LOT, expiration date, or manufacturer for any of these medications she reported historical adverse events on. The patient reported that she got her 2nd shot of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. She has soreness at the site, more-so several hours after getting the vaccine (09Apr2021). Just her arm felt sore within moments after the second vaccine, but she did not get this after the first. She rested and took it easy that weekend. There was Sore, Tired, general lethargy, and fatigue (Apr2021): when she looked online, it really only told her what everyone knows about that you might be sore and tired and she had all that, she thought she was through with all of that. She had no chills, just general lethargy and fatigue. She was sluggish and tired and not herself that weekend (Apr 2021). She stayed home so it is difficulty to say. Her arm was definitely sore. For sluggishness and fatigue, she said that she has been a couch potato for a year, it comes with the territory with lockdown and being depressed, so it is difficult to decide if it is health or physically induced or a emotional base. She did not knowingly spike a fever, no chills or sweats. And on Monday (did not clarify dates but states it was Monday after 09APR2021, throughout the weekend she took it easy), she noticed with her foot, she had difficulty getting out of bed could not put weight on her right foot. She was alarmed. She stayed home and rested and did a lot of napping and taking it slow. It is still difficulty and moving certain ways hurts more if she flexes. She has a known history of tendonitis so she wore her brace in the meantime. She thought maybe she had tendonitis in both ankles and this was similar so maybe it was a different set of tendons. She would wear a brace, and eventually it will get better in time. She also was wearing braces like compression socks that toes stick out of. She thought she had tendonitis and that is what she has done in the past. It has been a month and she is not better. This was her left foot, most of the pain was focused on the sole of her foot towards the outer edge. That is where it started. Then it migrated over time. That was weird and had her worried. It was all in her arch in the initial spot. She notes it is not like the tendonitis she had the first time. She does not want to be an alarmist or have her doctor think she is a hypochondriac she waited. She was then rubbing her foot, the right one, and noticed it was tender on the top of her foot just like the left one. There was sore. There was pain in right foot, pain in feet. Pain in feet, her left foot had most of the pain on the top and bottom and a lot of it is along the outer part of her sole of the foot. In her right foot, the pain is mostly at the fleshy part below her toes and on top of her foot. The pain moved around into the other foot for about a month so she went to the podiatrist yesterday (06May2021) and doctor did x-rays. The night before (05May2021), the opposite leg had a line of black and blue dots on her right calf that went up her leg, she did not notice this until Wednesday (05May2021) evening because she never examines it. She soaped up a washcloth and she knew where her parts are in the bath. Her mind wanders and she was not looking. She happened to be wearing something where her legs were not covered and that is how she knew. It did not hurt. It was strange, looking like bruising in a line. The doctor said it was all like one vein and he cold feel it. She can not feel it, but he could. The doctor told her these could be clots. She still has them. Doctor said the other leg where she had the pain was only soft tissue pain. Doctor found that every place that hurt when he touched it and it still hurts where he had touched it. She was told she does not have arthritis and she has had arthritis since she was 13. The doctor did not know what it is. It was her left foot constantly, and the right foot hurt off and on during that period. The left for sure was kind of a dull ache and throbbing. The right was only a little bit. The left was worse. It appeared to be soft tissue that was hurting and he said there are so many side effects of this new vaccine and to maybe try heat or ice. Ever since the patient left doctor's office until now (the time of reporting) she did not known if she need to be concerned, that if she does not know what it is, can ice or heat make it worse? She did not know the next steps. Treatment, she tried to keep it elevated because that can not hurt but that is about it. She has not done heat and ice because if the doctor does not know what it is, how does he know it will not make it worse. He asked if she could take aspirin and she said no she is allergic to aspirin. Tylenol she does not take often, only when she feels like she needs it and she has not been doing it often. When she stays off it, it does not hurt as much as when she is walking. She wanted  to know if she should be worried and she wanted to add (report this) to the database if this is a side effect and if Pfizer has ever heard of this before. There was also tired, general lethargy, and fatigue. At this point when reporting, she is single and lives alone, and said that ""God forbid something happens, there is nobody to say let's get you to a hospital"". She heard about blood clots on the news. When they said blood clot yesterday, it was a red warning light going on and a siren. At the time of reporting it was Friday and she did not know that if she need to rush to the hospital. Her primary care physician (PCP) said she had never heard of this and to call Pfizer. The patient asked if she is one of a small group of people this has happened to. She asked if she should not worry and it will go away or should she get to a hospital. She thought she had a problem with her feet (foot problem) but her podiatrist does not know what was going on. She communicated with her physician office today and she said she has never heard of this. She wanted to know if her symptoms have been heard of and if she should go to the hospital. The events did not require a visit to emergency room. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: height as ""5 and three quarters of an inch feet (5'0.75"")"" on an unspecified date; rapid COVID-19 test on 06May2021: negative; regular COVID-19 test on 06May2021: negative; x-ray on 06May2021 to make sure she did not break anything: unknown results.

Medical history included Lumpectomy over 20 years ago, High cholesterol over 20 years ago, seasonal allergy and asthma. She gets flu shot every year and has never had any issue with vaccines. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and AE(s) following prior vaccinations were none. Concomitant products included tocopherol (VITAMIN E); ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) for the past six months to prevent COVID; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for the cholesterol thing, takes it every day and has been on it about a year. She uses an inhaler for asthma she has had. Caller had experienced hypertension post first dose. Caller would like to know if she can or should get the second dose of vaccine on 20May2021. Caller has consulted with her PCP and states that she was not able to get answers. She had her first Pfizer COVID19 vaccine on 15Apr2021.That same week she was diagnosed with COVID. She had mild symptoms initially. She started having symptoms that afternoon and didn't know if was related to the vaccine. She had arm soreness, fatigue, foggy memory, and was not feeling right. She went to her internist on that Friday who said she was exhibiting symptoms of COVID. They tested her. She had been tested twice the week before for traveling and was negative. So she was tested a week before she boarded and five days before she left. On the afternoon of 15Apr2021 she had chills and didn't feel well and the symptoms were so similar she didn't known if it was coincidental. The did COVID test on Friday and got the results on Saturday morning. She got sick with fever, chills, malaise, and all of those things. She was in quarantine. Her blood pressure started escalating. She is very fit and an avid walker. She walks 7 to 8 miles per day. She had no issues before the vaccine with blood pressure. Her blood pressure runs 110/60 and heart rate in 60s in Apr 2021, but since the vaccine she has been hypertensive. She ended up in the ER last week because she was having chest tightness probably from COVID and shortness of breath. She went to urgent care because the chest tightness got severe. They said her lungs looked good and she had resolving pneumonia. Her blood pressure was almost 170/110 in Apr 2021. It was very up and down and all over the place. They had said maybe it was related to chest tightness and shortness of breath. She is very concerned because of her blood pressure and she is still having some shortness of breath and tightness of chest. They said that could linger a while. All other symptoms are better, but the shortness of breath has not gotten better. Her blood pressure will be better, but if she walks it immediately shoots up. They had made a mistake and scheduled her to get her second vaccine on 05May2021. Callers internist said that they recommend waiting a little longer and there were lots of cases where patients get COVID in between vaccines. They said to wait until 20May2021 to get the second dose of the COVID19 vaccine. Should she get the vaccine if she is still having hypertension? She can't live like this if it is secondary to vaccine. Caller had EKG and all her cardio was good. She was checked for clots because post COVID people get clots. Her dimer was good and all of her results. She had no evidence of clots in the lungs. Caller runs a little high cholesterol. It has always been that way, but her other levels are good. Due to COVID caller cant be on statin. Caller clarified that she had never been on a statin for her cholesterol. The doctor never wanted to start on her a statin because her other levels were good. Her cholesterol is not causing the issue with her blood pressure. She dont know if she should get the second vaccine. She is in her 60's and looks like she is in her 40s. Caller knows the vaccine is directly related to the hypertension. It is not from COVID. The doctor said because she is over the other symptoms except shortness of breath and a little tightness. Her blood pressure is up and down. She knows she can get anxious if she continues to check it. In the morning she has pressure in the neck that she didn't have before. The elevated blood pressure happens all over the day. She didnt check it yesterday. Right now it is 130/80 and that is high for her. Her heart rate is in the 80s currently and usually she has a low pulse. She is getting back to trying to walk a little bit. She is pacing herself. Overall, she feels ok. Her appetite is still not better. She lost 7 to 8 pounds since COVID. She is about 119 pounds, but feels like it is muscle loss because she is not exercising. Can she safely take the other vaccine that is scheduled for 20May2021? Has it been long enough now? She knows she shouldn't do it before the 14th. Is this going to go away? Are there other reported cases? She did not want to go on blood pressure medication. She is in good health and just turned 63. She never had medical issues. The only issue she had was a lumpectomy over 20 years ago. weight: around 118 pounds. She was in the upper 120s, but since COVID she has not been able to get back to walking 7 to 8 miles per day. Caller was sick, but not as most cases. She didn't end up in the hospital from COVID. She went to hospital because of chest tightness and shortness of breath. Her blood pressure was up when she went to urgent care. All the other symptoms were gone. She is currently still having shortness of breath, chest tightness, and elevated blood pressure. Sometimes the blood pressure will stabilize in the 120s. She is finally sleeping better. She wakes up with a stiff neck, but it is not the bed because she has a nice bed and pillow. As a medical professional and after discussing it with her family that are medical professionals, she feels that it is a result form Pfizer. She just needs to know if it is safe for her to get it. Does she need it since she has antibodies from the first one? Arm soreness: it lasted a week. When she feels her arm now it is tender in the spot. The fatigue and foggy memory were disabling and she couldn't do anything. Hypertensive: Seriousness is hospitalization. She was in the ER for six or seven hours. After they removed her IV the discharge nurse checked her blood pressure again manually and it was 168 over 100. She asked if it was safe to send her home. They said that everything else looked good and that it was related to being cold and being in the hospital. They had ruled the other things out. She was still symptomatic and was still having shortness of breath and chest tightness when she was leaving the ER. The blood pressure hovered a lot in the 140s when she was laying in the bed. Her O2 sats were good, 98 or 99. Her blood pressure would shoot up to the 160s or 170s. The time they have for caller to go back is 05May2021 which is not 30 days. It is completely messed up. First, she went to the Urgent care on 30Apr2021 and they did x-ray. They couldn't check her for clots. She was having shortness of breath, chest tightness, and elevated blood pressure. They sent her to the ER on 30Apr2021. Her main question is the hypertension. Blood pressure is related to the vaccine itself and is not from COVID. Does she need the second vaccine since she already had the first one and has antibodies from COVID? Is it safe to do the second vaccine having hypertension from the first? She doesn't want to escalate this more and have it linger for several months. She has to get to work and do her job. With hypertension she gets tightness in chest. They said her lungs look good except for the area of resolving pneumonia. When she gets short of breath it is related to high blood pressure and tightness of chest. Is it safe to get second vaccine? She is very concerned about getting the second vaccine. What will happen with her blood pressure being all over the place? Her blood pressure is not steady and stable. The chest tightness is still there and has not gone away. It has improved some. It wasn't even 30 days. Is it ok to take the second dose with the blood pressure issues? The onset date of events was Apr 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. The nurse considered the COVID19 Vaccine was related to arm soreness, hypertensive, foggy memory and not feeling right. Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 on 31Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that immediately after being vaccinated, the patient had numbness in the left arm where vaccine was injected radiating down to hand lasting about 24 hours. Also on 21Apr2021, during the first night after vaccination,  chills, body shivering for a half hour. The patient also had low fever (extremely rare for the patient) for a while and a period of rapid heart rate/episode of tachycardia while in bed lasting for 30 (as reported). The patient had hypotension, 80/58. On 22Apr2021, the patient had fatigue, dizziness, pain and numbness on arms and hands sometimes, headache, upper back pain and myalgias. On 23Apr2021, the patient was very ill most of the day. The patient nearly passed out 2 times/near syncope, vomited, some loose bowel movements (unusual for the patient), extreme fatigue limiting activities, muscle pains/myalgias, headaches, numbness, sweating, feeling cold or hot sometimes. The patient's blood pressure dropped to 80/58 (usually 110/ 70). The patient lay flat on kitchen counter to avoid fainting. On 24Apr2021, the patient had fatigue limiting activities, pain, numbness, dizziness and feeling cold or hot sometimes. The patient felt a bump around her right collar bone in the evening which later turned out to be a tick. The patient's BP was measured every day which generally were initially 100/60 and then blood pressure would drop and settle at 85-95/60 or low 90s/60s, hypotension accompanied with severe weakness. On 25Apr2021, the patient had fatigue limiting activities, pain, numbness, dizziness, constant headache and feeling cold or hot sometimes. On 26Apr2021, the patient was nearly feeling normal in the first half of the day. Then severe body fatigue limiting activities, pain, numbness on the arms and hands. The patient was feeling cold or hot, sweaty at times and had persistent headache in the afternoon. The patient also had upper back muscle pain. In evening of 26Apr2021, the tick was noticed and pulled out dry with fingers and tweezers. The tick was not engorged with blood and appeared dry and dead. The patient had some redness around the bite but no target lesion. The patient was administered 200mg of Doxycycline orally. On 27Apr2021, the patient had fatigue, pain, numbness, cold or hot obviously in the first half of the day. Then feeling better (close to normalcy). On 28Apr2021, the patient was feeling much better in the first half of the day. Then, pain, numbness, feeling little cold or hot sometimes and persistent headache. That day and episodically thereafter, the patient noted left ear pain, earaches worst on the left and fullness and mild sore throat. The patient has also complained of difficulty processing information (attention deficit described in the papers) on an unspecified date. On 29Apr2021, there was severe fatigue all day. Pain, numbness, cold or hot sometimes, upper back muscle pain and sweating sometimes. On 30Apr2021 to 02May2021, the patient was very fatigued and was feeling dizzy frequently, activity was limited, a muscle pain, numbness and was cold or hot. The patient went to Urgent Care and was examined. Limited physical exam was normal. They drew blood tests which showed normal CBC on 23 machine differential both on 23Apr2021 and platelets except Low Platelet Volume on an unknown date in 2021, normal electrolytes and anaplasma test, negative blood sear for Babesia and Anaplasma and neg IgM and IgG for Lyme all on an unknown date in 2021. The patient's creatinine, BUN and renal function (fx) was unknown on an unspecified date in 2021. On 03May2021 and 06May the patient had similar symptoms, lasting about half of each day. On 06May2021, the patient had a nasal swab for COVID. On 07May2021 to 09May2021 the patient was very tired in the mornings, dizziness, episodic HAs, limiting activity. The events were partly improved by rest but the patient had constant ear pain mainly on the left side. The reporter stated that he deeper dive into the literature this weekend and came up with lots of papers of which the following publications are of special interest which includes:  1. One case report of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) after Pfizer mRNA vaccine  showing that POTS is frequently associated with auto-antibodies to G protein-coupled receptors, particularly norepinephrine receptors, epinephrine receptors and ACE2 receptors. In addition patients have elevations in a number inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL21, TNFalpha, IFNgamma, CD30) and platelet pool eficiencies (associated with low platelet volumes, dense granules, easy bruising). By the way, one can see dysautonomic disorder like POTS but without the tachycardia. One report described 31 patients with long COVID who had autoantibodies to the G protein coupled receptors with a variety of symptoms which can act as agonists or antagonists and are associated with a variety of syndromes (see their Table 1) with prominent fatigue, dysautonomic syndromes like POTS, neurologic and pain syndromes and cardiovascular syndromes. A potential synthesis is that these auto-antibodies are fairly common after COVID- 19 and perhaps also after other severe viral infections such as mono. Influenza etc which may lead to what we have called ME/CFS. There are a number hypothesis papers that predict that the spike protein-ACE2 receptor complex would elicit auto-Ab to ACE2. Its plausible that COVID-19 vaccines, particularly mRNAs which express spike intracellularly and cause a lot of inflammation also occasionally induce the syndrome. The reporter's question was whether abnormalities should be documented thoroughly including a full COVID-19 work-up for virus and antibody, auto-antibody panel, inflammatory markers, platelet work-up and a dysautonomia work-up. He added that pending the findings, the case should probably be reported. His most important goal is understanding the pathogenesis since that may lead to a logical therapeutic intervention in the event that these symptoms continue for a long time. The outcome of the events episodic HAs, period of rapid heart rate/episode of tachycardia, pain and numbness of left arm/numbness on the arms and hands, Some loose bowel movements, sweating, Mild sore throat,  difficulty processing information/ attention deficit, severe weakness, redness around the bite and low platelet volume was unknown. The outcome of the events numbness in left arm where vaccine was injected radiating down to hand was recovered on Apr2021 and the events Chills/body shivering and low fever recovered on 21Apr2021. The outcome of  the events fatigue/very tired in the mornings/Extreme fatigue limiting activities, Dizziness, upper back pain, headache, nearly passed out 2 times/near syncope, Vomited, Myalgias/ muscle pains, feeling cold or hot sometimes, 100/60 and then blood pressure would drop and settle at 85-95/60 or low 90s/60s, hypotension, pain, Upper back muscle pain and earaches worst on the left and fullness/left ear pain (ear pain) was not recovered.

The patient got two doses in 2020 but was given the booster: the earliest date was 12/14/2021 and it was due on 11/16/2021 but it was on 12-May-2021. Reporter wants to make sure that there are no contraindications. The doctor also came on the phone and said she wants to call the mother back and tell her that the child will be ok. Her main question is that this has happened before and she can tell the mother that the child will be okay and that it is not a problem getting three flu shots in 1 season, there is no issue with the child getting a flu shot next season. The doctor said she was pretty sure it will not be a problem but she would like to hear from company too. The recommended date of next flu shot was 11/16/2021. Doctor said she had ordered Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), varicella, Prevnar and Hepatitis A vaccines to be given today but instead of Prevnar, Fluzone Quadrivalent was given by mistake. Website says the earliest this child could get another flu vaccine is 14-Dec-2020. The Medical assistant had asked if based on that the child getting a flu shot today is ok. It was explained to caller that this has probably happened before but we do not have specifics and spoke for any side effects to look out for. Doctor was not satisfied with this answer, as she said this was not an overdose and the statement about no recommendations for getting multiple vaccines, she already knows, but since it has happened, can she tell the mother not to worry.

Spasms were prominent in inner thigh/groin and down entire legs.  Legs were not movable (heavy), difficult to get out of bed or walk.  Very strange and nothing like this ever experienced before shot. Fine next day.  Around 4/9, pain began in ball of R foot in the AM, hard to walk.  Over next few days, pain extended up to medial posterior calf (very painful), back of knee and groin.  Unexplained bruising on lateral calf.  4/20 woke to swelling of R leg (ankle, posterior knee, groin), went to Urgent Care that night and was sent directly to ER for DVT symptoms.   ER Ultrasound showed no clot, was sent home.  Pain continued to increase, with burning and difficulty walking.  Second Ultrasound done 4/22.  No clots found.  Pain continued to worsen, with swelling/aching on front of calf and severe foot pain.  Veins/skin tender.  Painful groin spasms happen again, same as night of shot.  PCP ordered ABI and spine Xray.  ABI was normal.  Xray showed same issue as 29 yrs ago (prior known L5S1 anterolisthesis; have not had back pain for many years...when I did, it was localised to spine and sciatic in the L hip, was not at all similar to these current issues in R leg.  perhaps related if inflammed, but is vastly different in symptoms and unlike past history).  Saw Vascular Surgeon 4/30, ordered abdominal CT Abdomen Pelvis w IV Contrast.  results normal. arm bruising at IV and blood draw site.  Saw second Vascular Surgeon 5/4 who felt pain related to inflammation response and ordered CBC.  Platelets 178. (patient had requested this test starting on 4/20, this was the first doctor to order it).  Pain continued but some relief found with compression socks.  on 5/10 US Bilateral lower extremity venous duplex with reflux study was done on both legs.  No DVTs, but damaged valves and reflux in the external iliac common femoral vein and femoral veins proximal segment (worse in R leg)  and great saphenous vein at the sapheno-femoral junction (R only).  These areas are where the spasms are happening but doctor not able to conclude relation, wants neuro consult, could be nerves causing spasms. Doctor prescribed compression socks for venous insufficiency concerns, to be rescanned annually for life. Vascular test results don't explain severe pain in calf and foot and referred to Neurologist for 5/28 visit.  As of today, 5/22, pain is persistent.  Pain/swelling is reduced with use of compression socks but returns without them; walking is difficult in the AM and PM hours; night time spasms.  Have also had shooting pains in L calf, both forearms, and ribs (back).  These occur mostly in the evening (nerve?).  Taking magnesium & extra vitamin D seems to help some. On strict anti-inflammatory diet.  I'd really like some guidance for treatment and what to do about boosters - do I switch to an mRNA vaccine?  I am a very healthy active 49 yr old woman who felt fine before the shot, and now I've been in a lot of pain, working greatly reduced hours for almost 4 weeks.  Please advise on what can be done to help.  Concerned about permanent damage and how to handle future vaccines.  (also of note:  first menstruation period was skipped after the shot, second period came a week late and was very heavy with bright red blood.  I am normally extremely regular, mod-heavy flow;  also, the J&J shot I had was a ""last shot of the day"" extra dose.  I was offered it while having a routine physical.

Within perhaps 48 hours of receiving my second COVID shot, my husband noticed a large bruise on the back of my leg. I didn't remember getting it but thought I must've forgotten a bump. I got more large bruises over the next couple days. A spot that bruised on top of my right thigh from my toddler playfully falling into me was the worst bruising I've ever had in my life, by far. It was very painful to walk and I needed ibuprofen for a couple days. The bruise was approximately 6""x2"" and developed many petechiae about the size of a piece of coarse kosher salt. It lasted about a week.  At two weeks post-shot, I have no bruises whatsoever, even with a rambunctious toddler.  One more thing that happened during this time is that when I'd blow my nose upon waking, there would be blood/dried blood on the tissue. One morning, within a few days of my shot, I got a mild bloody nose after blowing my nose and it took about 10 minutes before I could remove the kleenex from that nostril.

My Rheumatologist was unsure what to do and sent me to my gastroenterologist. My Gastroenterologist did an EGD on me on 2/18. By this time I was struggling to eat food and only drinking fluid. Cold and Hot water were painful. I could only have ""warm"" fluid. My gastro said that my esophagus was tight and had comparison data from a previous EGD to look at.

Continued to increase area, involving jaw on left side and to lesser extent jaw on right side - both TMJs involved. Pain was 9 on pain scale.

At the lowest, at 4:15am, my body temperature was 95 degrees.  Finally around 4:30am, I took  tramadol and wrapped my feet in a heating pad set on high. Was finally able to lie down, but extreme head and neck pain continued.   On-call doctor finally called me just after 5am. By then, my temperature was at 96 again. He said the tramadol was a good idea, and said to take another. Told me to keep an eye on my temperature. Spent the next 2 days in bed. I could feel the incredibly strong body pain moving from place to place in my body, like someone walking on a path. For the next 2 weeks, I was fatigued and had brain fog.

I continued to suffer from heart palpitations, chest tightness, and shortness of breath for the next few days, so I went to a Cardiologist, who again saw diffuse ST segment elevation on the EKG, which, due to my symptoms, he interpreted as a possible sign of pericarditis. I underwent a few additional tests, including an echocardiogram, chest CT, and continuous Holter monitor wearing. My doctor didn't see evidence of anything other than possible heart inflammation, so he prescribed me an NSAID (indomethacin) to be taken 3x a day for a week.   Now, 5 weeks after the start of my symptoms, I'm still suffering from chest tightness, shortness of breath, random onset fatigue, and dizziness. I've since been prescribed colchicine (0.6 mg, 2x a day) and have been taking that for 2 days.",,,,,,,,,N,,,,see above,PUB,,,,,,,2,05/22/2021,,Y,Y,

The next afternoon I walked about 30 minutes to the clinic throughout relatively hilly terrain and did notice that I seemed a bit more tired than usual and felt my heart was working a bit harder, but it was hard to tell if it was just mental anxiety about the whole thing. I met with Dr. and an EKG was performed. The results indicated possible LAE and possible RV conduction delay.  Both him and a colleague didn't see much reason for concern, however. I scheduled an upcoming video visit with a cardiologist. The feeling continued, varying in intensity for the next week. On Wednesday, May 19th (2wks post 2nd dose, 9 days post symptom onset), I returned home from a motorcycle ride (something I mention as it often results in stress?still learning) and walked up to my third floor apartment. I noticed I was particularly stressed from the climb and my heart felt like it was working harder than usual, and consequently I felt the strongest pain since the initial onset.

I asked if she felt comfortable with laying on the floor so that I could elevate her legs, and she stated she did but would like it to be in the consultation room (it seemed she was really embarrassed and didn't want to be so exposed where other people could see her). I asked if she felt sure she felt well enough to walk to the room (probably 6-8 small steps away) and she said yes so I physically assisted her in walking to the room. When we were approximately 2 steps from the room, she lost consciousness. She was very small (I'd say right under 100 pounds; which is something I considered originally in my decision to allow her to try to walk to the room), so I was able to easily catch and guide her body the last step or two to the consultation room without risking injury. I immediately elevated her feet and instructed my technician to page help (approx 2:20PM); she regained consciousness within one minute or so. We provided her with a cold bottle of water and a cold paper towel to apply to her face. She kept apologizing and was clearly embarrassed, but I assured her it was completely fine. I also made sure her young daughter stayed with me and tried to make her feel as comfortable as possible and provided her with stickers and a marker/paper and tried to keep her calm (she was noticeably worried). After coming to around 2:22PM, she continued to lay on the floor with her feet elevated around 2:35 when she stated she felt well enough to sit up. HCP's had arrived approx 2:25PM and she declined to have an ambulance dispatched as she was feeling better. She explained that she hadn't been to the doctor in over 10 years because she is worried/nervous about any type of medical intervention, including shots.

Avid bike rider and exercise buff usually runs circles around guys half his age.  I?m talking biking in the hills fit.  He does have a pacemaker now and has to tame things done, but I think he got the pacemaker because he pumped so much blood through that thing doing all those hills for all those years.  Not on any other meds expect whatever might be expected for the pacemaker.  He was at the gym on May 1 working out and sitting down doing some arm curls when all of a sudden he passed out, he regained consciousness as a couple of guys were helping him to his feet, that?s all he could remember.  He managed to drive himself home and then couldn?t shake the headaches and on coming symptoms, so one of his sons took him to the emergency room.  Within 30 minutes it was already determined the doctors needed to operate fast.  The stroke nightmare and recovery has process has been ongoing ever since.  He was transferred to a rehab on May 19th where it looks like he will stay for at least a couple weeks, hopefully.  He looks like he aged fifteen years, speech is ok, but he?s slow almost as if he is not hearing me?  I think his hearing is fine but it seems like he works to formulate the thought of what he wants to say as I write this summary on May 23rd.  He?s got two staples in his head, one pretty much top center and the other just a little off to his right.  Drain blood I assume as I?ve never seen a post stroke victim up close like that.

Maybe too much tequila and stuff like that, but my huge family usually all live into their 90?s and a few into their 100?s like my grandparents and my 104 year old great grandma.

My grandparent grew a substance and stored in jars of olive oil or canola oil and rubbed that stuff on their our bodies if ailments go really bad.  Other than that it?s highly concentrate oil of oregano.  Couple drops on your tongue will set your mouth on fire.  That?s the concentration we are talking about!  Anyhow, my uncle hasn?t done vaccines or flu shots in the past, but all this gloom and doom from the mainstream media convinced him to get the shot.  This now make the second person to stroke out after these unicorn shots.  Yeah thanks big pharma and you scandalous mainstream media for just reading your script and following along.  No thanks to all you physicians and nurses out there that also know better, but are keeping your fat traps shut and your hand out receiving your paycheck.  We wonder why there is vaccine hesitancy?

She recommended taking and allergy pill every day and the Pepcid for the next 4 days to see if the symptoms improved as well as Benadryl. She did say that the symptoms sounded more like they were reactions from the vaccine and not the medication, She recommended that after the 4 days if I still felt symptoms to take the Prednisone.

Thursday night Friday I treated symptoms with alternating doses of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, which succeeded in reducing the fever but did not rid of the headache. Saturday the debilitating headache persisted with extreme light sensitivity and nausea. The pain became so great Saturday night that my wife took me to the Emergency Room. There they performed a brain scan with an MRI that came back normal and treated the pain with Morphine. I was sent home around 8am Sunday morning with a prescription for Toradol. The pain did not decrease with the Toradol and by 6pm Sunday I was vomiting blood and the pain was excruciating. At the advice of my primary care doctor, I went back to the Emergency Room. In the Emergency department they performed a Lumbar Puncture and collected spinal fluid for testing, as well as blood for lab work. The pain was managed with Fentanyl. Late that evening the Hospital admitted me. I was given two more MRI's of the brain - one with contrast. I also underwent an upper scope of my esophagus, stomach, and upper colon which found 3 small ulcers likely due to the high volume of NSAID pain relievers taken over the previous days.

Intense nausea and sweating beginning 1-2 minutes post injection; unable to sit up. Lasted approximately 7-10 minutes before clearing up  2 hours later (7:10 pm), arm at and above injection site felt hot to the touch and had mild dull pain at every movement. Slightly dizzy and nauseous. Arm periodically ached without movement.  By 7:26 pm, arm pain from movement was a sharp pain, though still pretty mild.  Around 9:30 pm, gently pressed at site of injection and a jolt of pain went all the way down to my fingers  Nausea increased at 10:13, still mild. Decided to go to sleep. Woke up at least 5 times before 12:30 am in various states of pain and discomfort, including nausea when attempting to sit up; dry throat/mouth; pins and needles throughout my glutes and thighs accompanied by pain in my left hip, knee, ankle, and jaw; and mild to moderate arm pain at the injection site. Took about 15 minutes to be able to get up due to nausea and got some water.  Was cold so wrapped myself in a blanket. Nausea and arm pain with movement remained but I was able to go back to sleep around 1:15 am.  Woke up at 2:53 am - arm pain minimal and nausea gone, blanket felt nice but unnecessary, went back to sleep  Woke up at 5:34 am with pins and needles  in glutes and thighs and pain in my right jaw, knee, hip, and ankle (all sites of previous moderate injuries) along with a low grade headache. Went back to sleep.  Woke up after an hour or so feeling relatively normal, arm pain and headache returned after sitting up. Got out of bed but ended up taking another nap.  Woke up after another hour with just a headache and brain feeling fuzzy, but strong tingles began returning to my glutes and thighs  like they had fallen asleep (referred after this point as tingles). Arm hurt. Drank some more water and took another nap.  Woke up around 9:15 am with a low grade headache and slight tingles; fuzzy brain feeling was gone. Legs wobbly when I walked. Realized that tingling got worse anytime I was sitting down or lying on my back.  Around 10:20 am started crying - no known cause. Couldn't stop for a few minutes. This is not normal for me.  Around 1 pm realized I had a pretty high fever; unsure how high it was or how long I'd had it. Took another nap at 1:30 pm and woke up at 2:20 pm feeling much less hot so I thought it had broken, but I was told by my friend who dropped by that I was still feverish just much lower.  Slept from about 2:45-3:55 pm; headache was much better when I awoke; tingles and sore arm remained.  Realized at 4:13 pm that I'd had no appetite the whole day. I'd also barely been able to force myself to drink water; too cold and it hurt, room temperature didn't feel right.  No times, but felt periodic stabbing pain in my left ear until about 6:30 pm.  Much else also recovered by 6:30 pm: felt well enough to drink cold stuff, tingles were low grade, fever was present but low. Arm was still sore.  7:08 pm headache was gone.  8:49 pm felt much better and able to do things and take care of myself with minimal discomfort, but felt a little lousy overall - low grade headache, head felt like there was some pressure in it, periodic tingles, achy arm.  9:29 pm felt exhausted and slightly achy but otherwise mostly normal. Felt some hunger twinges for the first time that day but nothing felt appealing (realized I had only eaten about 5 spoonfuls of soup the whole day).

It wasn't from breathing and not very consistent or something I could re-create on command. It seemed to happen every hour for a few seconds and was a sudden, sharp pain. That was a concern for me so I did some basic internet searches and found that Chest pains are a symptom of the vaccine. I didn't think too much of it after that but It was a concern I kept in my head. My timeline gets a little foggy here but either that same day or the following day, the chest pains were still happening and I wasn't feeling 100%. One evening I went to take a bath. As I was laying in the water, my heart rate felt off, almost as if it was skipping a beat or not in the right rhythm. I remember laying in the bathtub, trying to count my pulse or seeing if I could ""catch"" the incorrect beat.  Rather than one normal heartbeat it felt like there was 2 beats very closely timed with each other. My heart rate felt faster than normal considering I was only laying down in water and didn't do any exercises the past few days. Unfortunately I never was able to find a good way to track the pulse and timing, but I was sure that something was wrong. I had difficulty sleeping that night because I kept feeling something wrong with my heart rhythm.  I got worried that I would need to go to the emergency room, but I told myself to sleep it off and if the chest pains and awkward heart beat continues for 5 days, I would go see a doctor. As for an outcome, thankfully I stopped noticing it around day 4 and haven't had chest pains since.

Currently on 30mg/day of XARELTO blood thinner (I've been taking since diagnosis on 5/5/21).  Will continue to take 20mg/day for the next 30 days.  Background: I started to notice my right calf get tight and sore approximately ~3 weeks following my vaccination.  I had been doing a lot of running and hill training so I assumed it was a muscle strain/aggravation.  After approximately 1-2 weeks I noticed the tightness worsen and also noticed significant swelling around my lower calf/ankle.  I went to the doctor on 5/4/21 and was given a D Dimer blood test which came back 1.27 mcg/mL FEU (over the recommended 0.5 mcg/mL).  The next day I had an ultrasound of my right leg where they discovered the SVT clot behind my right knee in a superficial vein (but near a major/deep vein intersection).  I was immediately prescribed XARELTO blood thinner - to be taken for ~51 days.  ~21 days of 30mg/day (15mg twice/day) followed by ~30 days of 20mg/day 1x per day.  The morning of 5/20/21 around 6:30am I started to feel nausea and vertigo after returning home from walking my dog.  I finished a low-intensity exercise routine at my home and around ~7:15am my symptoms worsened.  I went upstairs to my bedroom to lay down on my bed and the room started spinning.  I then went to the bathroom and vomited clear fluid.  I started feeling a little better after vomiting but was still slightly dizzy and light-headed.  I made an appointment and went to the doctor around 10:30am.  The doctor suggested doing further bloodwork and a CT scan of my head.  Both tests came back normal.  The doctor suggested the vertigo and nausea were inner ear related and that I should continue taking XARELTO and to also start wearing a compression sock (especially during exercise/activity).,,,Y,,,,,,N,04/01/2021,04/23/2021,22,"(5/4/21 at 5:31pm) D DIMER QUANTITATIVE-BLOOD - 1.27 mcg/mL FEU standard range (<0.5 mcg/mL FEU)  (5/5/21 at 11:26am) VL LOW EXT VENOUS DUPLEX RT - discovered superficial blood clot (SVT) in the small saphenous vein - it is close to the junction of a deeper vein, so we need to put you on anticoagulation.

My watch tracks my pulse rate and reports on screen. After I took a shower at 9:30, I noticed that my pulse felt high. I laid down, thinking it was just from taking a hot shower and it would go back down to normal.  That's when I looked at my watch report and it looked like a stair step, with my heart rate increasing steadily every few hours, starting at 4 p.m. It was currently 110-120 (my normal RHR is 60, and drops into the 50s when I'm asleep). I went to bed, hoping I was just in my own head about this and it would be fine. I woke at 2 a.m.  and my heart rate had not dropped below 100 while I was asleep and was at 130. I went to the ER at 2:00 a.m. because it was alarming. There were points where it spiked to 150 while sitting still. The ER ran an EKG, full blood and urine labs, monitored my heart rate and BP - my BP was in the normal range the whole time. The doctor who saw me in the ER was awesome. Her husband is still dealing with lingering neurological damage from having COVID last year. She informed me that I was not in a-fib or any type of cardiac distress and my labs were all normal, but was likely having an immune response to the vaccine.  They did a chest x-ray and CT to check for blood clots and both came back negative. My platelet count was well within normal range as well. I returned home about 6 a.m.  and my heart rate was still higher than normal, but had already started to work its way down. It stair-stepped down just like it went up and by 4 p.m., my RHR was back down to 70 and it was down in the 50s overnight. Aside from that, I had the typical headache, low-grade temp and overall body aches. Everything had subsided by Sunday afternoon. I did make an appointment see my PCP as instructed by the ER doctor on Tuesday, April 13. She had read all reports from the ER and was pleased with how my heart rate had come back down to normal. This was the same day that the authorities stopped use of the Jannsen shot due to the blood clot concerns. Dr ran another platelet count for my own peace of mind and it was a little higher than it was when I was in the ER, so she was confident that I was not in any danger, but did review the symptoms/warning signs of blood clots with me just in case.

I went to my regular Primary Care doctor who didn't see anything  wrong.  She referred me to an ENT.  The ENT ran a hearing test.  The hearing test seemed to come back ok but I still have the Tinnitus.  The Tinnitus is worse at night and in the morning when everything is very quiet.  Some days are worse than others and I have seen no improvement.  I also am experiencing hot flashes.  They also happened after the first shot and increased after the second.

After 3 days of steroids and other pain meds the pain went away. 3/30/21 I was now experiencing tooth pain specific to the upper right back molar and the upper left back molar. They both felt loose ad pain when chewing. 4/7/21 I went to my dentist and he said the upper right molar appeared to be cracked and needed to be extracted.

She did a checkup and blood work. 4/20/21 I was rushed to the emergency room for critically low hemoglobin (5.5) and given 2 units of blood, fluids, and a B12 infusion. 4/21/21 Endoscope procedure while in the hospital showed a possible hernia problem but there was no strong conclusive reason for my mouth pain, cracked teeth and low hemoglobin. I am now taking supplements and seemed much recovered. I believe this was a onetime event caused by the vaccine. My primary doctor, agrees the mouth pain has been reported as a side effect. In October of 2020 I had a complete checkup with my primary Dr.  and was found to be very healthy and did not have any problems until I received the vaccine.

Her throat felt tight and she was getting worse despite antihistamines and used her Epipen.  Went to ED and given bendaryl, ativan, solumedrol.  She felt better and was discharged home.  Yesterday she had another bad flare but was feeling better today.  Took 60mg prednisone on Sunday and 50mg this AM.   After her Xolair she had a significant flare.  She felt her whole body flushing and she developed hives and itching.  Her voice changed and her throat was tight and she was given epi x2.  Also took 50mg of hydroxyzine and was given IV benadryl.  She was taken to the ED.  I spoke with the ED doctor at 4:30 and she seemed to be better.  She was given pepsid as well as zofran and ativan.  I spoke with her at 5:45 and she sounded like she was not feeling better.  Her voice was froggy and she reported that she did not feel like things were calming down. I spoke with the ED again and asked them to give her another 50mg of hydroxyzine and if still not improving solumedrol.   I do think this is in the setting of her vaccination causing an immune stimulation and not related to the Xolair.  We discussed that the Xolair should help but may not be immediate.

Some weakness, as well as muscular soreness in the left arm persisted in the insuring days. The reason why I chose to report my experience is because something that I thought was abnormal happened. On the evening of May 15th, as I was putting on my pajamas, I noticed an irregular mass in my left breast. As I examined it further, I realized that this mass was not there previously and warning shots fired off in my head, immediately. I immediately asked my grandmother to do another examination of my breast, and she confirmed my suspicion that there was a foreign mass located above my nipple in my left breast. It was difficult for me to closely monitor this mass as it was difficult for me to think about it as it triggered emotional distress. I asked my mom to do an examination and she also noted the mass. A little more than a week later, I noticed that the mass shrunk. Since everyone in my family was on edge for nearly a week suspecting that a 21 year old female in their family could possibly have breast cancer, this caused my family to consult my grandmother?s doctor, and have her assistant contact me about what could potentially be happening. Her assistant spoke to me over the phone and communicated that it is important for me to have the mass formally examined and for me to receive a mammogram. She also mentioned that many women who have received the vaccine also noticed irregular lumps in their breasts after receiving the vaccine. I want women in my age range to be aware that they might notice lumps in their breasts after the vaccine and not to experience the same emotional distress of thinking that they have breast cancer when it could be inflammation occurring in their lymph nodes as a result of being administered the Covid vaccine.",,,,,,,,,N,05/10/2021,05/10/2021,0,"I have yet to have an appointment with my doctor, but if asked, I will update the situation to those who request it.",OTH,,Loloestrin Fe,Infrequent migraines,N/A,,,2,05/24/2021,,Y,,Lamb

My airway (not my throat or tonsils) in my chest area started to close and constrict. But it only went so far - it didn't finish closing. I got the sensation that I was going to faint. I was in my car. I yelled for help and went out of my car. I had no energy or ability to walk. I went down to ground and could barely lift my head up. I got very lethargic and was extremely tired and nauseous and I could hardly think. The person who gave me the injection and another lady who was helping out came to help me. My intuition told me I needed Benadryl and my hands were kind of moving to try to get Benadryl. But I could hardly get up. I wanted to call 9-1-1 but my toddler had my phone. I couldn't kneel up even to get my phone to from my toddler. I couldn't walk. They took my blood pressure and heart rate and noticed during the episode that they both had spiked. They said they couldn't give me Benadryl because then they told I wouldn't be able to drive. Then I had a second episode - where I started feeling like I was going to pass out again and a feeling of doom was coming over me and I think I asked for Benadryl again. I could barely hold up the pulse oximeter - I think I was dragging it on the ground; I was on the ground on the parking lot. I thought I was going to faint but I was able to finally get my phone and call my sister. My sister showed up and got dropped off. The ladies didn't help out at all and my sister was going to drive me away. My limbs were really cold and feet were really cold all the way to my knees. I asked for a heating pad. I couldn't get up for 30 minutes, and then for an hour. My tried to get better and I could barely stand up. It took me awhile to get into the car; my sister had to help me. The next day, I was still in the same predicament. I couldn't get up and walk around. After a really long time of resting, I could go a short distance to go to the bathroom alone. My sister (I was staying at her house since I couldn't take care of myself)  finally said that my intuition had told me to take Benadryl and she said I should take one. I took a half of child's of Benadryl because the people at the vaccine site had not thought I should have one and that it would just go away. That 1/2 dose gave me hope that I could get better but I still didn't know if I should have a full dose. The Benadryl would help for a little while. I finally went home the the next day. I went to  ER and I couldn't still walk very well on my own.  On January 23, 2021 - t he ER.  The doctor thought if she gave me an EPI pen but thought I might have more problems with it. She said that if Benadryl was helping than to keep taking it. The doctor didn't give me a dosage. I went back to ER on the 27th  because I still was not getting better. I was taking Benadryl and I was taking inhalers and at first I thought I felt like my airway felt more open when I took these but it didn't last for long. I didn't know, without guidance, how to take the medication - how much and how often. I couldn't think straight. On the 27th, that doctor listened but he wanted to help me.  He gave me Steroids for 5 days and Benadryl on top of that. And gave me Ativan to help me sleep. I had been going without sleep - I didn't have any other adult watching over me after the 3rd or 4th day when I left my sisters' house. Before the second ER visit, I didn't know when my airway was going to close. I could feel my heart racing/beating even when I wasn't doing anything. My heart rate would spike up to 119 or 120 randomly. I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. About 5 or 6 hours after the Steroids there was popping sound out of my ears. It was loud and happening a long time, I wasn't sure I could sleep but I wasn't as aware of my heart beating out of my chest either. I could finally walk that next morning after the Steroids. I was trying to play with my toddler even though I felt fatigue and felt like crud - but I could walk without feeling I would collapse. So I over did - I tried to take a walk to the end of the street and I couldn't do it. My back hurt so bad after that. When I would lay down, I could not get the heaviness in my back to go away. It hurt so bad. I had a lump in my throat ( a little lower than my throat). That was scaring me. I went to ER again  (third visit)  - 28th  or 29th - tests came back normal.  I think it was the 28th. On that night, I was still on prednisone and I couldn't sleep with the pain. They gave me aspirin in case it was a heart thing. The aspirin may have helped with back pain. I took my Steroid pill and Ativan and that was my first night's sleep. The next morning, I could walk and I started to get a lot more hope at that point. I think I took Ativan for a couple of nights and got some good night's sleep. I took the Prednisone for 5 days and I didn't feel anymore like I couldn't stand up or that I was going to fall or that I needed supervision anymore. After about a month,  I had enough energy to finally drive and go to the store. I had been scared to drive because of my symptoms before that. By mid February, I was able to drive out and I went to a couple of stores. At that point, I felt like I was going to get better.  I'm a single mom and have been doing everything on my own for 20 years. I was talking to the doctor's office and to the nurse almost every day when I was sick. I don't get sick and I don't ever have to ask for help.

It comes and goes, and has continued through-out the day.  Itching has now developed on my arms, right breast (nipple area) and feet.  I have a general ""internal"" itch that I can't seem to scratch on my arms, legs and feet.  On Saturday 5/22, Sunday 5/23 and Monday 5/24 I have also experienced strong nerve pain in my left eye and the lower right side of my head.  The pain is sudden, strong but goes away fairly quickly.   My left large tie also has developed a numbness, started off with a lot of tingling in that toe. My head generally has a fullness feeling, specifically my ears have a throbbing sensation that I also equate to a similar feeling when my cold sores are active.  There is a dull ache behind my ears and the lower back of my head.    I developed a headache starting on 5/20 (over the counter meds helped with that) Pain at injection site lasted for 3 days, but was manageable and did not interfere with daily activities.  I have not had a cold sore develop as my dr told me to take Valtrex, I have taken one pill of that on 5/24.

Unsure why she has not been placed on AC and patient stated he only had one episode of Afib. Chest XR showed No acute cardiac pulmonary findings. Patient refused to have MRI brain due to anxiety. She stated that she attempted to have a MRI before and even with medication for anxiety she was not able to.

Pretty quickly, the chills got really violent and I felt really bad; like I had the flu. I noticed I was having trouble breathing. I have had anaphylaxis in the past before this. I did have a fever, it was low. I was up most of the night - bad night sweats; hurt all over, couldn't sleep as I was really miserable. The next day, I took Tylenol - around 03:00 am, but the next day I couldn't get out of bed and I had really violent chills, fever, body aches and headache was coming and going. I was still having trouble breathing. I took one Tylenol twice that day - one in the late morning and one in the evening sometime. Two days post vaccination, I started feel less bad, I still had a bit of a headache and I still had trouble breathing - chest was really tight. I was very low energy. I finally contacted my doctor after four days with trouble breathing. He told me to take an Advil or Tylenol and thought it was allergic response to vaccine. I took an Advil. The tightness decreased a bit. Didn't go away but noticeably better. The tightness was just continuing. The next day all the news came out about J&J vaccine, I called the doctor to tell him I was still having chest tightness and trouble breathing and they told me to call my PCP because they couldn't get me in. I called my PCP and she called back 2 hour later and I had just seen her the day before the vaccine and everything was very good that day she had seen me with oxygen, etc. . I went and go a pulse oximeter at Target - it came back at 100% and it would vacillate between 90-100%. My oxygen seemed fine. I thought it was a mass cell reaction to the vaccine  - that's what I felt - and I continued to take Advil every so often. It was about a week post vaccine when the tightness in my chest finally normalized. I continued to have fatigue.

1344639,05/24/2021,WA,59.0,59,,F,,"Patient arrived at ED 05/03/2021 with slurred speech, left-sided facial droop, left leg weakness.  Per discharge summary by MD : Before January 2021 pt was quite healthy and working in a casino.  On January 15, she fell in the parking lot and was started on Ibuprofen (800 mg) and flexeril for pain control.  On mid-February pt received COVID vaccine and about 1 week afterwards she developed dyspnea on exertion associated with night sweats, poor appetite, dry cough.   She had multiple workup done in the clinic including PCR-SARS-COVID x 2, which on both occasions were negative.  She was found to have elevated inflammatory markers including ESR and C-reactive protein.    She subsequently presented to ER the first time on 3/23 and found to be febrile with temperature of 39.3, saturation of oxygen was 100% on room air.  She had a repeat PCR-SARS-COVID.  This is her third one, which was negative.  She was found to have elevated levels of RF,  ANCA, markedly elevated CRP (>150).  She had (B) temporal artery biopsy that was negative.  She was discharged with oral prednisone 20 mg a day.   When she seen by Dr of rheumatology in clinic a few weeks later, her prednisone was increased to 60 mg a day for 2 weeks, then reduced to 50 mg a day.   She presented back to the hospital (this admission) on 5/3/21 with slurred speech, left facial droop, and LLE weakness and left foot numbness.  MRI brain showed acute infarct of left corona radiata though Dr of neurology reviewed the MRI and felt that there is some abnormality in the right temporal region as well, which would explain pt's neurologic symptoms.   She was placed on aspirin and high-dose statin (LDL was 132).  Usual stroke workup was negative.  She was maintained on prednisone for her recent dx of vasculitis.   She subsequently developed severe pain of her left flank and subsequent eruption of a dermatomal rash, consistent with shingles.  She was started on Valtrex 1 g three times daily.  She was also started on neurontin with uptitrating doses.   She had persistent pain so Lidoderm patches were tried which improved her pain significantly.   Initially there was consideration of rehab placement though pt improved to a point that she was felt appropriate to discharge home.  However, pt's daughter, who would be caring for patient at home, is 6-month pregnant, and worried about pt's shingles and the risk of transmission.   Therefore pt was not discharged home but rather kept in the hospital on Valtrex with ongoing attempts at placement.  Pt ultimately finished 7-day of Valtrex.  The vesicles on her left back have all flattened and the area now is mostly a nearly confluent region of dark discoloration.   At this point we re-discussed with pt's daughter that since pt has finished a 7-day course of Valtrex and that her vesicles have resolved, there is extremely low risk of transmission, especially with standard hand-washing hygiene at home.  Pt is also quite independent at this time and would not need assistance from her daughter for ambulation/ADL.  Pt will also have her own room at home.  At this time, pt's daughter and family were agreeable to take patient home.   In retrospect, pt's ""vasculitis"" symptoms appear to have started in earnest about 1 week after she received her COVID shot (1st shot, she never received a 2nd shot due to severe symptoms) so it is possible that her vasculitis may have been caused/triggered by COVID vaccine.  Other possibilities (less likely) include high-dose Ibuprofen (though she took lots of this in 2010 after another fall) or flexeril, though the timeframe is a bit longer.   In any event, she was advised to avoid unnecessary medications, particularly NSAIDs and flexeril at this time until her clinical picture becomes clearer.  She should also never receive COVID vaccine again.",,,Y,,Y,14,,,Y,02/11/2021,05/03/2021,81,"From 05/03/2021-05/15/2021 during  hospitalization: CT HEAD WO CONTRAST,  CTA HEAD NECK, Venous duplex LE left , MR HEAD WO CONTRAST,  Venous Duplex Lower Extremity - Bilateral .

On 4/14, I woke up with a massive headache and saw the news about the vaccine, so I went back to the ER to get checked for blood clots. They did an EKG, CT Scan of the abdomen and head, along with more bloodwork. Everything was normal, but my bloodwork showed an elevation of something that indicated that I have an infection, but they weren't sure what. They sent me home with no diagnosis. Over the next two days, I rested and I gradually started to get my strength back.

Sometimes it was expressed as just a discomforting tightness in the chest, but most noticeably it was expressed as a kind of stitch in the side kind of pain located in the center of the chest and in upper abdominals, between and right below the breasts. It wasn't chronic, but faded in and out depending on movement. This side effect was most acute for the latter half of Sunday and for all of Monday, 5/10. On Tuesday, 5/11 it had subsided enough that I felt I could resume my normal workout routine. On 5/11, I was able to complete my normal workout, even as some exercises (like standing crunches) made the chest pain/abdominal pain particularly acute. The most severe stretch of this symptom seems to be from that late Sunday through Tuesday afternoon.

My heart rate and blood pressure are always very low due to my active lifestyle. Normally my resting heart rate is in the 50's or low 60's and my blood pressure around 100-110/60-65. My health was great - I exercised, worked, was active with my kids, and never had any of these symptoms prior to the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Days 1-2 post vaccine, I only experienced sore arm, my throat became tight/raspier, and a little tired. A few days after 1st shot, I had a big heart palpitation that woke me from deep sleep and heart was racing/pounding in the middle of the night. Next couple days noticed heart was working really hard doing the simplest things like standing up, laundry, or walking up the stairs. Heart rate was faster, my blood pressure was higher at rest, and my left arm where I had the shot continually felt tingly/numb. On day 6, about 1-2 hours after working out while sitting at my computer working, I developed the most intense crushing chest pain, high BP, extreme fogginess/brain fog (couldn't see the words on the screen), nauseous, felt like I might vomit, light headed, my outer fingers in left hand couldn't function and type (they curled up), and thought I was going to pass out. I laid down and took a nap. Day 7, my overall body feels off with similar symptoms. Day 8, I tried working out again and ended up experiencing the same debilitating symptoms described above plus chills but worse which sent me to the ER. They ran a battery of tests (EKG, blood work, chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound) to rule out a blood clot from vaccine or heart attack. All tests normal and sent home. Days 9-21 - overall body feels weak from head to toe, low energy, smallest movements make heart race/pound, chest feels achy (squeezing pressure at times), left arm is still tingly, brain fog is terrible, nausea off/on, appetite is off, losing weight, high BP for me (130-140/80-90's), dizziness, tighter/raspier throat, bra and pants feel like putting pressure on chest/stomach (so not wearing them), sitting can feel like compressing something so have to get up frequently, hard time focusing, and haven't exercised at all for 2 weeks. Exerting too much energy seems to make things worse. Aside from these regular symptoms, I keep having ""episodes"" where things get worse and feel like I may pass out.  I followed up with my doctor around day 12 and she ordered a 48 hr heart holter monitor and heart stress test. Day 22 (5/13) - another intense episode that sends me back to the ER (same symptoms described above plus a very painful lump feeling on left arm near where vaccine was given that developed couple days prior). Repeat blood work and chest x-ray. Day 23-31 (today), while my energy level has started improving and overall I don't feel as awful head to toe as before, I still have chest discomfort/heart racing with little exertion, higher BP than my normal, brain fog, sometimes feel like might pass out, left arm still tingly, and have noticed my feet turn bright red when I am standing (not even for a long time). Laying down seems to help relieve some of these symptoms. I have another follow up appointment with my doctor this week. There is no doubt, the vaccine triggered something in my body causing these symptoms. Now I just want to know how to treat it so I can get back to feeling 100% like myself before I had the shot.

It all started with upper back muscle aches, on the same side as the vaccine injection. At first, I thought perhaps I pulled a muscle at a workout class, however after the third day of fatigue, the pain started intensifying throughout my body. My knees, ankles, wrists, back, neck and head started intensely aching and turned to flu-like fatigue and a low-grade fever which rendered me bedridden and unable to sleep or move much.   On 4/21, I checked into urgent care where both my COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were negative, so I was instructed to go to the ER to be evaluated for possible meningitis. At the ER, I mentioned separately to both the doctor and a nurse that I believed my symptoms could be related to the vaccine, but they both promptly dismissed the idea and discharged me with a ?muscle ache.?  For two days I was in relentless pain, which left me basically moaning and crying for hours on end. Several of my previous gymnastics injuries from when I was in my teens had resurfaced. My knee swelled up so badly that I couldn?t walk, my previous fractured wrists started aching, my left foot became inflamed, ankles ached, and a rare skin disease I had when I was 19, erythema nodosum, large painful welts on the legs, also re-emerged.   On 4/23, I saw my primary care doctor who also dismissed the idea of my condition being vaccine-related and misdiagnosed me with a respiratory infection, prescribing muscle relaxers that did nothing to ease the discomfort. Three days later I went back in to see her after my condition worsened and she ran labs and suggested it could be an STD (it was not).   On 4/28, the pain was intolerable, and I checked into a different ER where they admitted me to the hospital, ran labs and kept me overnight because my heart rate was so high. It was at a different hospital where the Infectious Disease doctor, finally diagnosed me with having a severe allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and told me that he had seen other similar cases. I was discharged and put on Dexamethasone.  My steroid dose ended on 5/3, and one day later, I started experiencing violent sickness along with the same arthritic symptoms as before, so I checked back into the ER where my knee was drained because there was worry of infection (it was not infected) and I was put on a longer, tapered course of steroid (prednisone) and referred to a Rheumatologist who ruled out autoimmune diseases and confirmed this was a reaction to the vaccine.  I finished the second round of steroids last week and am experiencing the same symptoms all over again, swelling and inflammation of the knee, severe pain in the right psoas, right toe pain, severe neck aches, and sleepless nights. I wanted to avoid a third round of steroids but couldn't endure the pain and swelling and it got to the point where I could barely walk or move, so I'm back on a third course for 15 more days.

My lungs felt like they had substantially less capacity with a deep breath than before the symptoms presented. I had extreme fatigue, joint and muscle pain.

The following morning (8th day) I felt much better, and decided to go on a mountain bike ride to see how my heart and breathing felt. I noticed some decreased cardiovascular performance, but not as bad as the previous days. Later that evening, the shortness of breath and elevated heart rate came back.

I hope that these symptoms subside and are not permanent.

Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience severe or worsening abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, stiff neck, shortness of breath, coughing or vomiting up blood, chest pain, increased fever, unexplained weight loss, or blood in stool. Follow up with you primary care provider for questions or any new symptoms Seek immediate emergency medical attention if you experience severe or worsening abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, stiff neck, shortness of breath, coughing or vomiting up blood, chest pain, increased fever, unexplained weight loss, or blood in stool. Positive Test results You were seen for COVID-19 Testing and have tested positive. Follow up with your primary care provider for questions or any new symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), you can stop self-isolating if you meet the below criteria   If you will not have a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these three things have happened: o You have had no fever for at least 24 hours (that is 24 hours of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND o other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND o at least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared   Managing your symptoms During this viral illness, rest and hydration are important in your recovery. You can take anti-fever medication as directed per your healthcare provider and package instructions.  Prevent the spread of illness  Separate yourself from other people in your home As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.  Call ahead before visiting your doctor If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider?s office take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.  Wear a facemask You should wear a facemask, if possible, when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider?s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with you should not be in the same room with you, or they should wear a facemask if they enter your room.  Cover your coughs and sneezes Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw used tissues in a lined trash can; immediately clean your hands as described below.  Clean your hands often Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water is preferred if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid sharing personal household items You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and dried before use by others.  Clean all ?high-touch? surfaces every day High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.

I?m a first responder and did not feel this was anxiety, but didn?t argue and forgot about it until it happened again.   I had my second episode on April 20th, and debated going to the ER for it. A third episode on April 23rd did put me in the ER. I proceeded to have more episodes on almost a daily basis after that and started monitoring blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and food intake at home (some of my bloodwork levels were off due to the celiac). I purchased a heart rate monitor, a blood glucose meter, and a smartwatch to monitor some of my symptoms. Both devices (monitor and watch) would later flag me as having a suspicious heart rhythm (heart monitor could be for fast/slow rhythm or for arrhythmia, smartwatch flagged me as Afib twice). I could not recreate these results when my husband wore the devices.  Episodes could be as brief as 45 mins or last more than 12 hours. I have a high pain tolerance and illness tolerance, and had to leave work several times due to my symptoms (extremely abnormal for me).   After several more appointments with my primary doc and another visit to the ER (where they did another EKG, an X-ray, and more bloodwork), things were still coming back inconclusive.  After about April 28th, I started having significant chest pain with my episodes. The ER checked me for possible clotting related to the heart issues and my birth control pills. My arrhythmia could not be captured on their devices.   My doctor has since diagnosed it as suspected myocarditis (pending more testing). We?ve ruled out all possible things related to my Celiac diagnosis, and can?t seem to find a cause for this.

How to Improve Your Breathing with COVID-19               Try to spend as little time as possible flat on your back! The largest part of your lungs are in the back of your body. When you lay on your back this causes fluid to pool in those parts of your lungs making it harder to breathe. Laying in different positions or sitting up will allow all the different parts of your lung to expand properly. You may notice it is easier to breathe immediately or soon after changing positions.                One of the best positions for this is called 'prone position' which is laying face down on your belly. This position makes it easiest for the biggest parts of your lungs to expand easily. This is called 'proning' and the more time spent proning the happier your lungs will be. Laying on your sides or sitting up in a chair is also helpful for breathing and changing positions helps keep your skin healthy.   Tips to Help with Repositioning ? Try placing pillows under the chest, hips, and lower legs when lying face down ? Trying different arm and leg positions can assist with comfort  ? Eat your meals sitting up in a chair when possible ? When laying on your side, a pillow behind you will help you not to roll on your back if you fall asleep ? If a position is too uncomfortable move on to another; comfort and rest are important parts of recovery ? Switch positions in a rotation to help all the areas of your lungs expand",,,,,,,,,Y,03/31/2021,04/28/2021,28,"04/29/21 1924  COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2,RNA Molecular Amplification)  Collected: 04/28/21 1538 | Final result | Specimen: Swab from Nasopharynx   COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Overall Result DetectedCritical",PVT,,allopurinoL (ZYLOPRIM) 300 mg tablet aspirin 81 mg tablet atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet elderberry fruit and flower 460-115 mg capsule garlic capsule hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) 50 mg tablet lisinopriL (ZESTRIL) 2.5 mg tablet metoprolol,,"Nervous Numbness   Respiratory COPD, moderate Obstructive sleep apnea of adult Sleep-related hypoventilation OSA on CPAP   Circulatory Supraventricular premature beats Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) without rupture  CAD in native artery HTN (hypertension) Left anterior fascicular block Stenosis of both renal arteries  Right bundle-branch block Sinus bradycardia Varicose veins of both lower extremities CHF with unknown LVEF  PAC (premature atrial contraction) Renovascular hypertension Bilateral carotid artery stenosis Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  Mild aortic valve sclerosis PFO (patent foramen ovale) LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) Mitral annular calcification Presence of Watchman left atrial appendage closure device   Digestive Tubulovillous adenoma of colon Other constipation Acute superficial gastritis without hemorrhage   Genitourinary Nocturia CKD (chronic kidney disease) stage 2, GFR 60-89 ml/min   Musculoskeletal Actinic keratosis Idiopathic chronic gout of multiple sites without tophus Sebaceous cyst Edema of both legs Stasis dermatitis of both legs   Endocrine/Metabolic Dyslipidemia Hyperbilirubinemia Hypoproteinemia    Hematologic Macrocytosis   Immune Hypogammaglobulinemia Psoriasis   Other History of thyrotoxicosis Patient has active power of attorney for health care Psychophysiological insomnia Patient has living will Male erectile disorder of organic origin Abnormal serum protein electrophoresis Overweight Encounter for therapeutic drug monitoring Poor sleep pattern",,,2,05/25/2021,,Y,,Ace Inhibitors Piroxicam
