A 44-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Dec2020 as a single dose (reported as 0.3 mL) (at the age of 44-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism, one thyroid gland removed due to a nodule on an unspecified date (years ago), ongoing acid reflux, ongoing hypercholesteremia, ongoing fluid retention, and ongoing history of headaches. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism and for one thyroid gland removed due to a nodule from an unspecified date and ongoing, dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) taken for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing, atorvastatin (LIPITOR) taken for hypercholesterolemia from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, and hydrochlorothiazide (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for fluid retention from an unspecified date and ongoing.

The events, stuffy head and horrible headache, were reported as medically significant. The events, cough, fever, and slight chest congestion, were reported as non-serious. The clinical course was reported as follows: It was reported that the patient was vaccinated on 16Dec2020, became symptomatic on 31Dec2020, and tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Jan2021. The patient stated that she became symptomatic one day prior to testing positive for COVID-19, on 31Dec2020. She initially had cold-like symptoms with a stuffy head, cough and a horrible headache; the worst headache she had ever had. These symptoms occurred earlier in the day on the 31Dec2020. Then later that night about 10:00 PM, she had a fever with a body temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Her body temperature had been normal at 98 degrees all day that day until that night. She also had slight chest congestion and then was fever free for over 48 hours. The patient stated that she had a history of headaches and can tolerate a headache. The headache started 31Dec2020 and was significant. It was reported that after the vaccine, she had no other symptoms other than a slight sore arm, which lasted a day; maybe 24 hours after she received the vaccine. The patient stated that she does not think any of the other symptoms, other than the sore arm, have anything to do with the vaccine. The clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test after first dose of vaccine and slight sore arm was unknown; cold like symptoms, horrible headache, and cough was recovering; fever was recovered on 02Jan2021; and stuffy head and slight chest congestion was not recovered.

When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother's house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up.

A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt ""funny "" but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel ""foggy"" and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.

The patient's concurrent conditions included multiple myeloma (MM). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; anatomical location, dose, route of administration and indication: not reported). The batch number was not reported.  On an unspecified date, 5 days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient presented with subjective myalgias lasting two days. Vital signs were stable, complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) were unremarkable and serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl. The patient was discharged on supportive therapy.  On an unspecified date, the day later, the patient presented with persistent flu-like symptoms. Labs revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl; normal renal function, total protein, albumin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels; clear urine analysis (UA) with no albuminuria; low parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1, 25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and viscosity levels. 24-hour urine collection revealed proteinuria (550 mg). Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy. Quantitative immunoglobulins (Ig) revealed elevated IgA (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG and IgM levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electro-phoresis (UPEP) and serum immunofixation revealed IgA-Kappa MM. The patient developed severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia, she was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, Pamidronate (pamidronate disodium), and hemodialysis. The patient's calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl. Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions. The patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid, and she has not attained remission from myeloma yet.  On an unknown date, the patient recovered from the event 'hypercalcemia'.  At the time of initial report, the patient had not recovered from 'multiple myeloma'.  The outcome of all the rest events was not reported.   The reporters assessed the event of 'cytokine storm' as related to the influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. It was theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM. This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM. The reporter did not provide a causality assessment for other events.  The events of 'cytokine storm' and 'multiple myeloma' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.    Company comment: A 65-year-old female patient experienced cytokine storm, plasma cell myeloma, hypercalcemia and influenza like illness. Symptoms of the reported events started emerging one day after administration of influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. Very detail laboratory and diagnostic findings were provided in the report. Causality is assessed as possibly related for influenza like illness and for cytokine storm due to biological plausibility and presented information and unrelated for plasma cell myeloma due to biological and temporal implausibility. Hypercalcemia is more likely related to myeloma however the reporter's rationale points to vaccine as well, therefore assessed as unlikely related.

Dec 29- pain has continued to intensify, now shoulder, and entire left arm. Fingers on left hand intermittently numb except for pointer finger that stays numb, and hand is colder than right hand Dec 29, 2020- results of C-Spine showed no significant issues. Small herniation in one of the disks. Per MD, ?more suspicious of a muscular issue or something external to spine pinching that nerve?. Pain has continued despite medications ordered.  Dec 30, 2020 MD referred me to a Neuroversion for pain control. I did not want to go here yet, I wanted to know what was causing the issue, not just treat the pain, decided to wait to make this appointment and instead get an appointment with a Neurologist on Monday due to offices being closed on New Year?s Eve.  January 4, 2021 pain, numbness and now weakness have persisted all weekend, appointment with Neurologist scheduled for Tuesday January 5, 2021. January 5, 2021, appointment with Neurologist, suspecting Parsonage-Turner Syndrome.   Parsonage Turner syndrome (PTS) is characterized by the sudden onset of shoulder and upper arm pain followed by progressive (worsening over time) weakness and/or atrophy of the affected area. The pain is felt along the path of one or more nerves and often has no obvious physical cause. The network of nerves involved in this syndrome is called the brachial plexus and it controls movement and sensation in the shoulders and arms. The cause is still unknown (idiopathic). However, researchers believe that most cases are due to an autoimmune response following exposure to an illness or environmental factor. Suspected triggers include viral and bacterial infections, surgery, vaccinations, injury, childbirth, strenuous exercise, certain medical procedures, and various health conditions. Treatment is symptomatic and may include pain relievers, corticosteroids and physical therapy.[1][2] January 6, 2021- MRI of left shoulder completed January 8 2021- Follow up of MRI with neurologist. No abnormalities seen on MRI, ruled out any other tumors, or anatomical issues causing pain. Diagnosis Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. Increased dosages of current medications and added another to control nerve pain.  January 9, 2021- pain seems to be lessening, numbness and weakness continues January 10, 2021- significant pain returned, numbness and weakness continues.

I had a mildly sore arm for the first couple of days following the vaccine, but that was about it for side effects. I noticed my face was a little flushed when I was driving home afterward, but I chalked it up to being excited and nervous and wearing a face mask.  Seven days later, it started to feel itchy around my vaccination site (upper left arm). There has been some mild swelling around the site, in addition to being itchy. The area is also warmer than the rest of my arm or body. For one night, it was uncomfortable sleeping on my left side.  Starting on the 8th day after the vaccine, there is a small amount of redness just above the vaccine site, about an inch and a half wide, a little larger than a quarter.  Here are my doctor's notes, who I saw on January 12: Patient is a 40 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of rash/ possible injection reaction  involving the left upper arm. Rash started yesterday.. she noted slight swelling, warmth, and itching with pink erythema in a spot just above the area of her arm where she had her COVID injection 1 week ago. She received the Moderna vaccine.   Associated symptoms: no associated symptoms. Patient denies: fever, headache, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgia, decrease in energy level. She did not have significant pain at the time of the injection, and had a mild sore arm the following few days but no other symptoms after the shot. The warmth and swelling began just yesterday, almost a week later. She has reported this to the VARS website. She is employed by public health and is going to work at a covid vaccination site tonight, checking in people who are getting vaccines.  She has a h/o sensitive skin, but no h/o hives or urticaria, no previous injection reactions. She get racing heart from epinephrine but no other known allergies.  She denies dizziness, dyspnea, SOB, cough, or sensation of swelling in throat.  She has been using ibuprofen, cold compresses for sxs with some relief.  Assessment:  Probable injection site reaction, delayed reaction No strong evidence of cellulitis but we discussed signs and symptoms to be watchful for such as increased swelling and redness or tenderness of the overlying skin, fevers, chills, body aches.  Plan:  Medications: Benadryl 25 mg administered in clinic and discussed use of antihistamines to reduce injection site reaction. She can continue use of ibuprofen and cool compresses as well. Avoid over cooling of skin as this may also cause local reaction.  If pain, redness, or other sxs of concern progress she should follow up.  Verbal patient instruction given. Follow up: as needed.

Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor's office.

Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again.

The co-worker in this report was vaccinated with a syringe containing air only and no actual vaccine. How the error occurred - a first-time volunteer from critical care transport was assisting at the hospital?s vaccine clinic with vaccine preparation and was observed correctly drawing up doses from the first vial. Error occurred when the volunteer drew up doses from the second vial (and was not being observed). The volunteer drew up air only and no vaccine. How the error was discovered - administrator thought the syringe felt ?strange? and did not contain any vaccine. The error was discovered at that point. Investigation found that the volunteer had drawn up a total of 6 doses that contained air instead of vaccine and were dispensed for administration. Four vaccine syringes containing only air (and no vaccine) were recovered unused. Two vaccine syringes containing air (and no vaccine) had reached patients. This patient (KW) received one of the affected syringes, was still at vaccine clinic when the error was discovered and was immediately re-vaccinated with a correctly prepared syringe.
