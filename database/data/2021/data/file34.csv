Six days later, however, sometime early morning on March 12, (I was in and out of sleep because of it), I had pain swallowing my saliva on my left side (also the side of my vaccine in my arm). It was hard to pinpoint but the pain came from somewhere at the back of my throat and my ear. If I had to guess what time it was, it probably was around 1-2am that the pain began. March 12, I went to see my primary care doctor. He checked my ears & didn't see any concern. He saw a little redness at the back of my throat but couldn't definitively say what I had. He thought it was a virus but didn?t discount a reaction to the vaccine (although he said it was unlikely since reactions usually happen within 3 days). He ran no tests and didn't prescribe anything.  March 13, I was feeling worse. I suddenly had a fever (101 was the highest it ever got), swollen lymph nodes, a white tongue. I went to the local ER at 9am who said I might have oral thrush but he didn?t sound convinced because my tongue wasn't as white o thick as thrush would present (he said for example that typically when you have thrush, you could scrap it off and it would bleed). He diagnosed me with Thrush and Lymphadenopathy. He prescribed anti-fungus medication Clotrimazole 10 mg Troche, five times a day. On Sunday, March 14, my throat pain got worse (it was constant pain v.s. pain only swallowing) so I called the on-call doc who told me to get tested for Strep.  The next day, on March 15, I could swallow easier so my doctor didn't think it was necessary. My lymph nodes were still swollen, I had a bit of a fever, and it was still a bit hard to swallow but I was recovering. I had some lingering ear pain.  By March 15 I was much better.  Today, March 19, I still have a sensation on my left ear/throat area after swallowing but I am much better. Please note that while the ER doctor thought it was fungal and my primary care doctor thought it was viral, neither were sure/thought it was the vaccine.   ** Also please note, this is the second time I am completing this because the system booted me off after 20 min the first time and it was erased.

This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer's recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.  Recommendation:  When repackaging COVID Vaccine vials for distribution to vaccination centers, a label including the expiration date and time should be placed on the new container.  When COVID vaccine is transferred from one location or department to the next, a double check of the product, quantity, integrity and expiration date and time may prevent a recurrence of this situation.",,,,,,,,,,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,UNK,,,,,,,2,03/19/2021,,,,

Immunostains for CMV, HSV-1/2, and VZV are negative. B: Stomach, body, biopsy: Gastric corpus mucosa with chronic inactive gastritis, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and mildly thickened subepithelial collagen (see Comment). There is no intestinal metaplasia. An immunostain for Helicobacter is negative. C: Colon, random, biopsy: Mildly inflamed colonic mucosa with expanded lamina propria, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and mildly thickened subepithelial collagen, highlighted by a trichrome stain (see Comment). COMMENT: There is active inflammation and injury involving both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The overall pattern of injury is unusual, however, with lymphocytic/mild collagenous gastritis and colitis-like injury in the stomach and colon, respectively, and active duodenitis with neutrophilic infiltrate and associated partial villous blunting in the duodenum in the absence of significant intraepithelial lymphocytes or expanded subepithelial collagen. There is no chronic inflammatory alteration, and no granuloma is observed. No definite viral cytopathic change is identified. No Helicobacter organism is present. A unifying etiology includes a differential that encompasses drug, particularly in a patient with a clinical history of PD-1 inhibitor therapy such as nivolumab, as well as other possibilities such as infection, autoimmune disorder, and early IBD.

Medical history included chronic idiopathic urticaria, scrombid poisoning. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. The caller states she is a long-time retired nurse. The caller wishes to report an adverse event 74 hours after receiving the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The caller mentions she would appreciate some follow-up. Caller declined to include a healthcare professional for the report at this time. Today, 09Feb2021, at 11am, she broke out in hives from her hands to the arches of her feet, it was progressive. She took one Benadryl at that time and she had to take a second Benadryl over-the-counter dosage an hour later because the hives had not subsided. Right now, the hives are resolved but of course she is still covered by the second Benadryl she last took which was at noon. When probed for UPC, Lot number or expiry date for the Benadryl, the caller states it's over the counter, and she doesn't have that. Caller explains 2 years ago, she experienced hives, but it was diagnosed quite after when she returned (she was traveling at the time). She was diagnosed with ""scrombid poisoning"", 35 people had the same fish she and she was the one who was hypersensitive to it. It's basically a fish that was about to turn bad, but it isn't. She got hives and ended up in ER. She was tested for multiple food allergies and all were negative. Through the process of elimination, she was given a preliminary diagnosis of chronic idiopathic urticaria which was diagnosed over 2 years ago. The caller explains she thought of the vaccine after 5pm so she will call her physician tomorrow regarding this reaction. Of course, she had her paperwork, so she wanted to get it on Pfizer's records. Of course, if there is a other that have had hive experiences, she would be greatly appreciative if someone followed up with her about it. She is hoping this is just a strange little hive breakout and not a true reaction to the vaccine. She also would like to know if there is any guidance on second dosage.

I was then escorted to a chair for a 15 minute observation period. I did not have any allergic reactions to the shot. I continued to feel slight soreness in my left arm for the rest of the day.  At approximately 8 pm I began to feel ""aches and pains"" similar to those during a cold and flu. I took (1) regular strength Tylenol Acetaminophen 325 mg tablet. I began to feel a little bit warm around 9-10 pm and checked my temperature with an infrared thermometer and it was slightly elevated by a degree (no exact measurement). I  went to bed at approximately 11:30 pm.   At approximately 12:45 am I woke up and took my temperature. I first used the infrared thermometer and it came back as 99.4 F. I felt very warm so I then switched to an Oral thermometer for accuracy and began to record the following: 101.1 F - 12:45am (was under blankets so got out of bed to cool off) / 100.0 F - 1:05 am / 100.9 F - 1:20 am  At 1:10am I used a cold compress (small ice pack wrapped in a kitchen towel) to cool off and then took a luke-warm shower at 1:15 am (did not wet hair). I also drank a big water bottle of water (Tap Water) probably around 500ml. The room temperature was around 74 F. I re-measured my temp at 1:40 am and it decreased to 99.3 F.

At 7:30am I took a 3rd & 4th Tylenol. Temp at 7:55am was 99.4F. I went back to sleep and then woke up at 9am to login remotely for work. Temp at 9:25 am was 98.7.  I then took a nap from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm (my boss told me to go to sleep after our call) and slept very soundly. When I woke up I felt a lot better. Aches and pains were no longer present and fever appeared to be gone. The worst of the symptoms were over. I then spot checked my temp a few times throughout the day: 98.0F at 12:15pm / 98.3 F at 1:40pm / 98.7 at 2:05 pm. At 2:15 pm I took a 5th Tylenol just in case.

I also am very sensitive to joint pain and muscle pain due to my lupus so I was not surprised by my ?overreaction to the soreness of both injections.

I also had a large lump with redness and heat. It was more severe with dose number two. I also had pain into my left shoulder and neck. This didn?t concern me and I expected it. I also had severe joint pain bilaterally in all of my joints with malaise and fatigue. This also didn?t concern me. However in February after my second  Moderna vaccine, I began to experience shooting pain in my left back and chest ? just under my left shoulder blade and sometimes running around into my sternum area ?only when lying in the supine position (flat on my back) and only beginning a few minutes after lying down upon taking in a deep breath.  This pain was relieved by sitting up. Initially I thought I had a rib out of place and went to a chiropractor to have an adjustment.

The next day, about 24 hrs. later I became very dizzy but didn't develop shaking, diaphoresis, or black spots in my vision.  (I've had hypoglycemic episodes rarely, maybe every several years, but I know well what they feel like.  No further episodes since then.  I wasn't prepared for the episode and didn't have candy or orange juice handy.  It required I lay down for 10 minutes while I was very shaky and cold, clammy diaphoresis.  Pita Chips helped---I presume.    Yesterday I received the second dose and 29 hours later I started getting hypoglycemic again but quickly drank some concentrated sugary lime juice.  I remained slightly shaken but never developed black spots or diaphoresis.  I still felt too light and shaky so I had another half glass of juice and feel normal after about 10 minutes.   When I reported this, my daughter, who is an ER doctor, was doubtful the first time it was vaccine related because of the 30 hour gap.  Before receiving the second dose, the doctor there also didn't believe it was related for the same reason.  But I find it very odd now that after both vaccines, at around the 30 hour mark, I had the same effects.  Except for a slight migraine- like headache, no other real symptoms----maybe some lethargy.  I'm not diabetic, so I'm not on insulin or diabetic pills.  I take a lower dose of blood pressure meds and have well-controlled hypertension.  I can't even remember the last time (in years) I had hypoglycemia, but I've never had it as bad as I did the first time.

I was unable to move my arm due to the pain. The pain was so severe (10 out of 10) that I couldn't sleep and I was concern it might be a heart attack.  I went to an urgent care center, They did an EKG and assuerd me that it wasn't a heart attack. The physican diagnosed a frozen shoulder and asked about the timing of my Covid vaccine.  I followed up the next day with my primary care physician and he suggested I report this as possibly related to vaccination.

On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven't' vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.",,,,,Y,4,,,N,02/12/2021,02/24/2021,12,see 18,OTH,,thyroid 150 mg a day,none,none,,,2,03/19/2021,,Y,Y,none

INFECTION IN ARM AFTER VACCINE  History of Present Illness  General:  Pt initiated and verbally consents to phone visit, pt without capability of televisit in lieu of clinic visit to limit exposure/contact during COVID19 pandemic. The pt and myself are present for today's visit.  68 y/o male presents today with c/o arm infection after vaccination. Pt had his second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 03/11/2021. He noted a sore arm after vaccinatino, but had no serious reactions or side effets immediately following vaccination. 2 days after vaccination, he noticed a small streak of blood from his injection site on his pillow. He covered the area with a bandaid. When later removing the bandaid, he noticed the area was red and there was some clear fluid on the bandaid. He cleaned the area with some peroxide and used some antibiotic ointment on it. The next day he noticed that in addition to the area being red, there was now an area of white pus approximately the size of a dime at the injection site. Pt notes that he called the Health Department to report the issue, they told him to contact his PCP which is why this appointment was scheduled. Pt did request an in-person appointment, but was told that he would have to schedule a phone visit with me. Today, the pt reports that there is still an area of pus about the size of a dime at the injection site. The surrounding area of redness is reducing. He notes that the pain in his arm also seems improved today. Pt denies fever, chills, lightheadedness/dizziness, N/ V, palpitations.  Vital Signs  WI 188, Ht 5 ft 6 in, BMI 30.34 Index, Ht-cm 167.64 cm, Wt-kg 85.28 kg.  Examination  General Examination:  GENERAL APPEARANCE: alert, in no distress.  LUNGS: Speaks in full sentences, no respiratory distress, no audible stridor or wheezing.  NEUROLOGIC: alert and oriented.  PSYCH: alert, oriented x4, cognitive function intact, speech clear.

Adverse effect of other vaccines and biological substances, initial encounter  Notes: From pt's history, this sounds like a mild superficial skin infection. Pt may benefit form I&D. I attempted to schedule the pt with a provider in our office today, but there is no availablility. He has been advised to go tot an urgent care or to the ER for treatment. Pt is to f/u with me next week. I will be requesting that my staff file a VAERS for this patient.  2. Others  Notes: 30 minutes spent on this phone visit.

Patient has since undergone rigorous detoxification with positive results, indicating that viral reactivation did indeed occur and was allowed to proliferate and spread to organs like the liver.

March 13 - Saturday morning, I started coughing c chest congestion, and had Phlegm rattling in my chest, started sneezing very frequently/ some diarrhea.  Otherwise, I felt fine. March 14 - Sunday morning, I started wheezing slightly, coughing more and sneezing frequently.  Felt fine.  Went shopping.  Nose ran so much in store, had to run to the store to get paper towels to catch it.  Later, when I carried a heavy bag of groceries from one car 12 feet to another, noticed I was very exhausted and had to rest about 15 minutes before driving home.  Wheezing more. Monday, March 15, I took my B/P meds at 1:00am and my blood pressure was way up x 4 (160?s/ 70?s) p58-64,  at 2:08am ? B/P was 183/92) so I took my PRN Clonidine and ate all the high Potassium foods I had in the house.   By 3:40am my B/P was 120/66 but went back up later with coughing.  I felt fine but tired. A little after 4am,  I carried a bag of apples and a bag of oranges up my stairs and was totally exhausted ? I felt the energy draining out of me, and so was out of breath I dropped the bags on the floor and  sat hyperventilating to get enough air in my lungs until I could breathe normally ? for 40 minutes -  it felt like fluid building in my lungs.  I started massaging my abdomen like crazy and coughing until it subsided ? considering whether I should go to E.R.  My breathing did get some better But I sure did not exert myself.  Just picking up my computer was taking my energy. Still coughing and getting rid of some phlegm.  This was very scary and I was on the verge of going to the E.R.   at 4:45am - I called the E.R. who said I probably could wait for a urgent care to open or talk to Dr.?s office.  My breathing was some better.  By 6:10am I was so tired I fell asleep.   At 10am my B/P was 138/77 p53.  Still very weak, coughing, wheezing, and trying to get rid of phlegm. I had no other symptoms.   I called my Dr. who got me in a urgent care in her building at 3pm.  That evening I started Postural Drainage which helped in getting rid of the phlegm.  I have continued that still. March 16 ? I ?chatted? my doctor to let her know all that was going on.  She scheduled me to see the Respiratory office in her building on the next day.  I was feeling much better ? little nasal dripping, lungs felt better,  March 17 ? Wednesday ? went to Respiratory appt but declined treatment because I felt so much better. More energy, better lungs than Tuesday, wheezing gone, less phlegm, still some coughing ? which is okay with me.

I spoke to some friends and a few of them suprisingly also reported extra heavy menstrual cycles or feeling like they were PMSing around 48 hours after. I couldn't find much online except for a bunch of random people complaining about the same thing, and no study or source of significance to back it. I'm wondering if this something they even looked out for? There seems to be a pretty strong correlation with certain people around my age just from asking around. And I don't think anyone who I spoke to even realized it could be connected until I mentioned it.

I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor's office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I'm  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb.

Began around 10:45am on March 13, by 11am the swelling was at least one inch, enough to distort left side of face and upper neck.  For context, I had been outside planting seedlings that morning and assumed a bug bite, but could not find any puncture wound consistent with a bite.  Alarmed, I immediately took a single benadryl tablet (over the counter) and gently massaged the area (during a zoom conference call!  Turned to my side so as to not alarm my colleagues!!).  I started to feel some drainage about 25 minutes later, and took a second benadryl around 12:15pm.  By late afternoon minimal swelling still present and left point of jawbone sore to touch.  Took one more benadryl  in the evening. Minor swelling but not disforming in the AM, took a final benadryl and by Sunday night March 14 the lyphedema was gone.   As I am a research psychologist, I started looking at the literature and reputable online resources early in the week (March 15/16/17); I found other reports of lymphedema post Moderna vaccine, noted reports that it is on the same side of the face/neck/chest as the vaccine (as it was in my case), and I concluded that THIS is the most likely cause of the swelling I experienced.  I had not ingested ANY food/drink that was new to me during this time, and, as previously stated, there was NO entry wound indicating a bug bite.   Thus, I am making this report to VAERS.

I was sent to the emergency room where they found the birth control and sent me home. I went back to the Student Health & Counseling to talk about my next options on getting it out on February 19th. We took some blood work to make sure everything was alright. My doctor was worried that the knot in my arm might have been a blood clot. She sent me to get an ultrasound where the Doppler said the knot looked like it was swelling. A few hours later, my doctor called me back and told me to go to the emergency room because my d-dimer levels were high. I went to the hospital, they took blood work again and everything came back fine. After a couple of days, the pain and swelling went down but it did cause my nexplanon birth control to migrate in my arm. I got the second vaccine on March 4.

A 30-year-old female subject received the first dose of blinded vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) on 17Aug2020 at 17:01 and second dose on 09Sep2020 at 15:20, both intramuscularly on the left deltoid as single doses for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing allergies. Ongoing concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for allergies. The subject had no other vaccine administered neither on the same day nor within four weeks prior to the administration of the investigational vaccine and no relevant family medical history. The subject had no history of trauma, heavy lifting or vigorous exercise, and the subject was believed to be right-handed. On 09Sep2020 at 18:00, the subject experienced shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) after the second vaccine dose, which was considered as a medically significant event and required physician office visit. The clinical course was as follows: on 09Sep2020 at evening, the subject had pain in the whole left arm. She noted that the band-aid was very high on her arm. She had some soreness of her upper arm and very limited range of motion for the first few days, with burning pain down her arm. Initially she had some tingling down her arm, but this had resolved. On 15Sep2020, the subject had a sensation of numbness which affected her arm and hand, with a sensation of loss of dexterity which was notable when typing. The subject informed that she was improving gradually, especially in terms of pain, but still had a significant limitation in range of motion and daily activities. On exam she did not have any obvious swelling, color change, bruising, or tenderness over the left deltoid. She could raise her left arm slightly higher than 90 degrees and with assistance could lift higher, but this caused significant discomfort. She could not extent her left arm behind her back well. Strength was 5/5. When moving her arm against resistance, she experienced pain down her arm and increased sensation of numbness. The investigator discussed a possible diagnosis of SIRVA. The subject was aware that it could be self-limiting and might last for some time. The subject expressed an interest to start with physical therapy and informed the investigator that she would try to arrange for such. The subject was seen by a neurologist who noted the following findings: motor function: normal muscle bulk and tone. No apparent fasciculations. No scapular winging. Shoulder abduction limited to 70 degrees; shoulder internal rotation limited as well but able to put her left hand behind her back. Manual muscle testing revealed the following MRC grades (R/L when applicable): Internal rotation 5/4+, External rotation 5/4 SA 5/4+, EF 5/5-, EE 5/4+, (proximal muscles limited by pain), pronation 5/4, WF 5/4+, WE 5/5, FF 5/5, FE 5/4+, FPL 5/4+, APB 5/4, IO 5/4+, HF 5/5, KE 5/5, KF 5/5, ADF 5/5, APF 5/5, toe extension 5/5, toe flexion 5/5. The neurologist considered two diagnoses: SIRVA and immune-mediated brachial plexus neuropathy (IBPN) (also known as Parsonage-Turner Syndrome) and noted that the clinical picture could demonstrate components of both. An electromyography (EMG) was recommended to determine if nerve involvement and if so, to what degree. Physical therapy was also recommended which the neurologist noted that the subject had already started. On 02Oct2020, the EMG was performed and stated as follow: ""Since onset, both the pain and limitation in range of motion have improved.

Summary: A. needle EMG examination of the left upper extremity was normal for all muscles sampled. The deltoid was avoided due to suspected prior injury to the area. B. Normal median sensory potential on the left. C. Normal and symmetric ulnar sensory potentials bilaterally. D. Normal and symmetric radial sensory potentials. E. Normal and symmetric medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous sensory potentials bilaterally. F. Normal medial mixed palmar latencies on the left. G. Normal median and ulnar motor conduction studies on the left. Conclusion: This was a normal study. 1. There was no neurophysiologic evidence of a brachial plexopathy on the left. 2. There was no neurophysiologic evidence of median nerve dysfunction at the wrist on the left. 3. There was no neurophysiologic evidence of ulnar nerve dysfunction across the elbow on the left. 4. There was no neurophysiologic evidence of a cervical radiculopathy on the left. Clinical correlation was recommended"". On 07Oct2020, the neurologist considered that SIRVA was the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical improvement and that the EMG result did not reveal nerve involvement in the neurons tested. The subject reported continued improvement especially of the upper arm with increased range of motion but continued decreased dexterity of the left hand. The subject was attending physical therapy twice weekly and reported satisfaction with the gradual and continued improvement the subject was experiencing. On 03Nov2020, the subject informed that she had completed 5 weeks of physical therapy, that her improvement was significant but that she was not back to her usual state of health. The action taken with the blinded vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) in response to the event was not applicable.  Subject was felt much better and had returned to baseline after completing physical therapy. The outcome of the event was completely recovered on 08Feb2021.  The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event SIRVA was related to the second dose blinded vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) and to a clinical trial procedure (vaccine administration) but considered it unrelated to concomitant medications.  On 21Sep2020, the blinded code was broken due to serious, related, unexpected event.  Follow-up (30Sep2020, 05Oct2020 and 07Oct2020): New information reported includes: reporter's details, medical history, laboratory data, treatment details and updated reaction data.   Follow-up (10Nov2020): New information reported includes: clinical course (subject's current status).  Follow-up (10Dec2020):  This is a follow-up report based on the receipt of the publication. No further information provided.  Follow-up (09Mar2021): New information reported includes: adverse reaction (event onset date specified, outcome of event updated to recovered) and clinical course. ; Sender's Comments: The event SIRVA is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) based on the information currently available.  There is a reasonable possibility for the event SIRVA to be related with the blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO). Based on the reported location of the band-aid, i.e., high up on the subject's arm, and the occurrence of the SIRVA, it appears that the vaccine was erroneously administered into or near the shoulder joint capsule. Postulated in the medical literature, unintentional injection of vaccines into the shoulder joint synovial tissues may result in an immune-mediated inflammatory reaction causing SIRVA. Reports of SIRVA has been associated with poor techniques in administering vaccines in general. The event is not considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO).  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,,,,,,,Y,09/09/2020,09/09/2020,0,"Test Date: 20201002; Test Name: EMG; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:EMG results/SUMMARY; Comments: A. needle EMG examination of the left upper extremity was normal for all muscles sampled.

Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor's appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication.

The subject's medical history included advanced maternal age. The subject's concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and mineral) for healthy pregnancy.  The subject's obstetrical history included three previous pregnancies with one full term live birth and two elective abortions. The subject had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The subject had no maternal or paternal medical history with MCMs. The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 23-Jun-2020. The subject's estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 30-Mar-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was not reported. The type of pregnancy was singleton.  On 02-Sep-2020, at approximately ten weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and  anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100239705.  On an unknown date in Sep-2020, an unknown amount of time after receiving Afluria Quadrivalent, the subject had low potassium.   On 18-Sep-2020, panorama test revealed no MCMs.    On 19-Sep-2020, first trimester screen revealed no MCMs.   On 21-Sep-2020, the subject started treatment for low potassium with potassium chlorate, at a dose of 20 mcg, three times a day, administered orally.   On 03-Nov-2020, amniocentesis revealed no MCMs.  On 06-Nov-2020, the subject finished the treatment with potassium chloride.  On 07-Mar-2021, at gestational age of 36.6 weeks (as reported), the subject delivered premature live male neonate via vaginal method of delivery. The birth weight of the neonate was 2781 g, head circumference 32 cm and length 49.5 cm. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) score at one minute was 9, at five minutes was 9 and at ten minutes was not reported. No pregnancy complications were noted. No MCM was identified at birth.  The outcome of the event 'premature delivery' was not reported.  At the time of follow up reporting on 10-Dec-2020, the subject had not recovered from the event of 'potassium low'.   The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The event of 'premature delivery' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  The case is linked to the case 202101842 (corresponding baby case).
