The vials were all smooth on the outside. There are no particles and the vaccine looks normal, even after its been reconstituted. She pulled some of the vials that were used out of the sharps container and peeled off the label to find that the dots and lines disappeared. She felt that they may be a result of air trapped between the label and the vial but she states that she is not sure and would like to know if she can still use the product or should discard them. In follow-up the pharmacist reported seeing something strange in the vial after reconstituting it with the diluent. She noticed what looks like a core as she injected the syringe and on further injection, she noticed that the piece was reflecting and picking up light and this piece was not moving in the solution. And she added that there are 2 vials with this appearance, and they have the same LOT#.  Pharmacist stated, they didn't inject the vial into the patient.  Pharmacist stated, ""It is not floating, it is a fixed spot on the vial where, when I look from one angle it looks like there could potentially be a core. So, it shows almost grey. When I move the vial, I can see the reflected light within the particle slightly and then if I move the vial further over where there is no fluid covering the spot, the spot is not noticeable. One vial is one spot, the other vial is a spot and what looks almost to be scraped on the inside. It is grey in color until I move the vial as such to where there is no fluid covering it, then it disappears. And when I move the vial further when there is fluid covering it, it will reflect light, so it's not really a true like particles, it's hard to describe. It is very, very small in 1 vial, may be the size like of a, I don't know like similar to like a 21 gauge needle. And then on the other vial it is one spot that's larger than that almost like the end of paper clip and then the part that almost appears to be like 'dry are faded' (voice distortion) and those are very, very faint lines. This happened after dilution of the vial with Sodium Chloride. I did not notice this prior to, I inspected the vial prior to dilution and I did not notice that either. At this point I completed the dilution around 8:55 for one of the vials and 9 o' clock for the other so.  It has been at as far as I am aware I have access to our continual monitor but we do keep a paper log of the refrigerator temp every day and it has been under refrigeration. It was removed from the ultra-low freezer at 8 o' clock on 11th, on Monday.""

She reported she had colon cancer 2 years ago that was 1 encapsulated tumor, so she didn't need chemo or radiation. She said her sigmoid colon and part of her descending colon were removed. She had severe complications after the surgery: her resection ruptured, she had septic shock and her ureter was severed. She had a colostomy and nephrostomy at the same time and then an ileostomy after the colostomy was taken down. She has frequent UTIs due to no backflow valve from her ureter to her kidney. She said she has had so much work on her colon, she has constant strictures resulting in bowel obstructions. She said she has had several stents placed in her colon due to the strictures. She said she didn't know if her previous medical history has anything to do with the rash she is experiencing now. She said when she had septic shock, she coded in the ICU and was on a ventilator.

She said she is not experiencing any pain, fever, or anything else. She said she has had no reactions to vaccines before. She is wondering if it makes any difference, but she had a UTI prior to taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has been taking antibiotics for the UTI. She said maybe she is experiencing a drug interaction between the antibiotic and the COVID-19 Vaccine, and that could have contributed to her rash. She first noticed the head to toe rash this morning. She said she initially woke up at 4:30AM and had a bowl of cereal. She said at that time she didn't notice anything different and went back to bed. When she woke up later on, and looked in the mirror, she saw she was covered in a rash.

I felt very foggy and my head wasn't right. I had to hold on to things and I sat down and I kept saying I just didn't feel right.  I called my daughter and my arm was hurting and I figure that's what happens, I was getting so tired and really bad headaches. My daughter asked somebody and they told me to take extra strength Tylenol (500 mg ) 2 at a time 6 hour intervals. Which i did i got up the next morning and i had to go back to bed i had no energy. I felt horrible. When i did get up in the afternoon all of a sudden i had horrible chills and that day in Florida it was 82 degrees and i put the heat on 84 and i was extremely shaky and cold. I went back to bed and later i did have a fever, not highs, it only went to 100.8 but during the evening it did break because my sheets were almost saturated. Yesterday morning 1/27 Wednesday i felt better, fever had gone down, pain was still there in my arm and swelling. I thought that was natural. In the afternoon i decided to take a shower and i noticed my left arm around the injection site was a red rash about 7inches long and 4-5 inches wide which  i had to seen before i called my primary doctor just to make sure this was normal around injection site and talked to the nurse and she thought it was normal. But if there was no changes to call her back on Friday. Last night not able to sleep i saw an article that said COVID arm rash seen after Moderna vaccine, annoying but harmless it was a large article and it made me feel better but there were only 14 examples but they believe there were more because they were younger people with the health dept. that received this vaccine. It said in 1week it should go away.

He got to the point where he couldnt even get 4 solid hours of sleep in a night. I of course brought him to his pediatrician. They had zero answers in anyway shape or form and referred us to a pediatric neurologist who also determined there was ""nothing"" wrong w/ my son. We were also referred to an ENT Dr who referred us for a sleep study.  This went on for approx 10mos, at which point I realized none of the drs were able to give me any explanantion what so ever. I started researching my sons symptoms. Nothing seemed to fit. The only thread of info I could find where the exact symptoms of my son matched was in a forum that different moms had written in. They also had been left in the dark and had no answer about what was happening to their kids. Upon relentless research, I ordered lavender,vetiver, and cedarwood essential oils. I applied at night before bed and for THE FIRST time in almost a year my sons epuleptic episodes went from a 10, to about a 4.

Over the next several days she reported marked swelling and tenderness over the triceps upper arm area; persistent swelling and pain in the neck that required cold packs for a couple days.  The reaction appeared to be more pronounced and extensive akin to the Humira local reaction she would ordinarily get; the last dose of that was 4 months prior.  By history, it sounds like extensive angioedema.  At no point was there any pruritus, erythema, or hive or rash on any other part of the body; no respiratory compromise, stridor or wheeze; and no fever.  Symptoms subsided over several days and she was well on day of her presenting for her second vaccination.  The vaccinator (who is a pediatrician), an on-call allergist; and this reporter (a medical oncologist) all consulted on best approach.

I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully.

On the 26th, started feeling slight soreness in joints in muscles kind of like they were locked up, didnt think much of it, thought it was maybe from overdoing a gym workout.  The next day on the 27th, woke up and was feeling chills, along with mostly full body soreness and feeling very lethargic.  I also had a baseball sized red area on the injection site on my shoulder, it was itchy, swollen and felt very firm to the touch especially compared to other shoulder.  I also had hive like red circular welts on my back, butt, and upper legs.  Two of my fingers had spots on them that felt like blisters.  Felt very sore and tired all day.  In the evening I took 50mg benadryl to try and combat the symptoms.  When I woke up the next morning (28th) still had all the same symptoms just felt slightly better overall.  Took 50mg more benadryl and felt pretty tired and lethargic throughout the day.  In the late afternoon I have started feeling more sore again, and have a slight headache.  The hives and red area on my shoulder are still present but not as red.  So far during this time I have not had any issues with my throat and breathing, but my sternum has been super sore, more sore than any other part of my body during this time.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine ""seems like it isn't working"". The patient stated it doesn't look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor's arms are so sore and 'blah blah' and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn't feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn't know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven't been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn't normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn't immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn't necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn't been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and 'on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%' was recovering, 'when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain' was not recovered while for other events was unknown.",,,,,,,,,N,01/13/2021,01/13/2021,0,Test Date: 20210113; Test Name: Pulse oximetry; Test Result:  95 %; Test Date: 20210113; Test Name: Pulse oximetry; Test Result:  91 %; Test Date: 20210113; Test Name: Pulse oximetry; Test Result:  93 %; Test Date: 20210113; Test Name: Pulse oximetry; Test Result:  96.5 %,PUB,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Allergy to plants; Asthma (Verbatim: Asthma); Hay fever (Verbatim: Hay fever); Hip surgery; Shellfish allergy (Verbatim: Shellfish allergy),,USPFIZER INC2021028951,2,01/27/2021,,,,

She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day.

On 25 Jan 21, when our supply of VanishPoint syringes with 1 inch needles was exhausted, 130 doses were drawn up into the Smiths Medical syringes with 1.5 inch needle.  Pharmacy staff routinely package 10 doses/syringes of vaccine in 5 x 8 inch amber bags for distribution to the vaccination clinic.  The fit is tight when trying to insert ten of the Smiths medical syringes with the needle protection devices into this size bag, and the needle protection devices got tangled with each other.  In addition, the pharmacy tech reports that some of the devices have a loose luer lock connection between the needle protection device and the needle. Of the 130 doses prepared during that batch, four needles became dislodged from the syringe unit sometime after leaving the pharmacy, and the doses had to be wasted. A better ratio of syringes with 1 inch needle to syringes with 1.5 inch needles would be 10:1 when vaccinating health care providers and active duty soldiers at this facility.",,,,,,,,,,01/25/2021,01/25/2021,0,,MIL,,,,,,,2,01/29/2021,,,,

Information on the patient's concurrent conditions, medical history or concomitant therapy was not reported.    It was claimed, that the patient sustained autoimmune disease, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (""POTS""), idiopathic hypersomnia (""IH""), myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (""ME / CFS""), complex regional pain syndrome (""CRPS""), and other serious injuries, as a result of his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections. It was claimed that quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) and its ingredients caused patient's autoimmune disease and other related injuries and resulted in him suffering from severe, debilitating, disabling and painful chronic injuries. Prior to receiving his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections, patient had no autoimmune diseases, no autonomic issues and no orthostasis.  On 06-MAY-2014, the patient was vaccinated with a first dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). Immediately following the injection, patient experienced a burning, painful sensation over a large area of his arm, including his shoulder. The deep burning pain was constant and severe for two full days. In the months following his first injection of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL), the patient began to have trouble staying awake for the latter part of the school day. He was exhausted and could barely keep his head up while sitting at his desk. He began to avoid the activities that he used to love due to his extreme fatigue.  On 09-JUL-2014, the patient was vaccinated with a second dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). Much like the first injection, it caused a similar deep, burning pain in his arm and shoulder. By August 2014, patient was having severe foot pain and needed crutches at school. His fatigue also increased during this time and he was having difficulty waking up in the morning and getting out of bed. He was also having memory problems, started performing poorly in school and developed terrible headaches. He was scheduled for his third quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injection in November 2014, but his pediatrician felt that the foot pain might have been a result of an adverse reaction to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL), so he was not administered the third shot.  As the months progressed, so did patient's injuries. He was seen by multiple physicians and specialists for his complaints which now included: migraine headaches; extreme pain in his leg and foot; body pains and muscle aches; chronic fatigue; hypersomnolence (sleeping 15-22 hours in a 24-hour period), sleep drunkenness, unrefreshing sleep; excessive sweating, lightheadedness, and tachycardia; tunnel vision on standing; difficulty with concentration and memory; confusion and brain fog; intermittent or episodic paralysis, numbness; and stomach pain making it difficult to eat.  As a result of his post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) symptoms, patient was unable to engage in normal activities that a normal teenager would enjoy. He could no longer attend school in the same manner he used to prior to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections, and he missed the majority of high school and had to complete most of the work at home. Patient had been accepted to a university and required extensive accommodations, including: missing classes, assignments and exams due to disability flare, exams in evening only, extended test time, mobility assistance, having a note-taker, and part-time status due to sustained illness.  As an adult, patient was disabled and would likely be unable to hold down a normal job or participate in the same activities that he used to prior to his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL)-induced injuries. After trying dozens of therapies and medications, patient is currently taking a regimen of 10 strong medications each day. He is able to walk about 500 steps per day and must be pushed in a wheelchair by his parents if he attempts to do anything more strenuous.  Studies, including serum samples from July 2018, demonstrated that patient had tested positive for the anti-alpha-1 adrenergic antibodies and anti-Muscarinic Cholinergic Receptor 4 - Antibodies, and an ""at risk"" result for anti-AT1R antibodies and anti-ETAR antibodies.  Based upon his chronic and severe post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) symptoms and adverse events as outlined above and the tests performed by dozens of medical providers, patient had been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to POTS,  IH, ME / CFS, chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), immune-mediated encephalitis (IE), CRPS, and gastroparesis.  Patient contended that his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections caused him to develop serious and debilitating injuries, including but not limited to autonomic, neurological, heterogenous autoimmune disease, POTS, IH, ME / CFS, CFIDS, IE, and CRPS, as well as a constellation of adverse symptoms, complications, injuries, and other adverse events, many of which are alleged herein and all of which were caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) or otherwise linked to his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL)-induced autoimmune disorder.  As a proximate result of Company's wrongful acts and omissions and its negligent and fraudulent testing, labeling, manufacturing, marketing and promotion of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL), patient has suffered and continues to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries, including his autoimmune disease and associated symptomology and has suffered severe and permanent emotional injuries, including pain and suffering. Patient also has a substantial fear of suffering additional and ongoing harms, including but not limited to now being at an increased risk of cancer, fertility problems and future symptoms and harms associated with his autoimmune disease as a result of his exposure to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL). As a direct and proximate result of his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL)-induced injuries, patient has suffered and continues to suffer economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, diminished income capacity and he will continue to incur these losses and expenses in the future.  The reporter considered all events to be disabling and related to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL).  Information regarding this patient was also received via media. It was reported that in the months following patient's first injection, exhaustion and extreme fatigue forced him away from the sports and hobbies that had been centerpieces of his life. He had trouble staying awake during the school day. After his second quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injection, patient developed severe foot pain in both feet, so severe that he needed crutches to attend school. He had trouble waking up in the morning and getting out of bed. As his symptoms worsened, multiple physicians and specialists treated him for migraine headaches, body pains and muscle aches; chronic fatigue, hypersomnolence, sleep drunkenness, unrefreshing sleep, excessive sweating, lightheadedness, tachycardia, tunnel vision on standing, difficulty with concentration and memory, confusion and brain fog, intermittent or episodic paralysis, numbness and stomach pains. Patient's post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injuries and diagnoses including POTS, IH,ME/CFS, CRPS and gastroparesis, kept him from his passions, sports and hobbies. He missed most of high school and only his formidable self-discipline allowed him to complete his school work at home - he could not walk or move unassisted.  Upon internal review, the events of tunnel vision, gastroparesis and immune-mediated encephalitis were considered to be medically significant.",,,,,,,,Y,N,05/06/2014,,,,UNK,,,,,,US0095075132101USA011807,2,01/29/2021,,,,

The patient's medical history included migraines and osteoporosis. The patient's had flu shots for many years, after which she experienced usual side effects, reported as flu symptoms, chills and fatigue. The patient's concomitant medications included Imitrex (sumatriptan) for migraines.  On 02-Oct-2020, at 14:00 pm, the patient was vaccinated with Afluria Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine, dose: 0.5 ml (reported as one dose), route of administration reported as injection and anatomical location: left arm) for an influenza prevention. The batch number reported was 276580, expiration date: 30-Jun-2021.  On 03-Oct-2020, one day after vaccination, the patient started developing mild flu symptoms, chills and fatigue like she normally did, as reported. The patient did not run a fever at all during that event. On the same night, the patient noticed some tenderness in the glands in her neck and around ears, just below her left ear in the glandular area, and it woke her up at 03:00 am. On the same day, the patient developed significant swelling and much pain on both side of her face, like she had the mumps, much worse on the left side (which was the side where the shot was given), which was very puffy and painful.  On 04-Oct-2020, on Sunday, two days after vaccination, when the patient woke up, she had a hard time opening her mouth and she was in a lot of pain where her jaw came together.   On an unspecified date in Oct-2020, the patient developed dry mouth. The patient did not take any treatments for events.  On an unspecified date in Oct-2020, 3-4 days from flu reaction as reported,  the patient recovered from all the events and no longer had concerns.  The reporter assessed all events as related to Afluria Quadrivalent as reporter stated that she had an odd reaction to Afluria shot.  The reporter assessed this case as non-serious.   The event of 'flu symptoms' was considered to be serious due to the criterion of medical significance by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked with the case 202004939 (the same patient).  Additional information received on 22-Jan-2021 from other non-health professional: The stop dates for all events were provided and outcome was changed from resolving to resolved. The narrative was amended accordingly.  Company comment: A 70-year-old patient was vaccinated with Afluria Quadrivalent. One day after vaccination, the patient started developing mild flu symptoms, chills, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, tenderness, pain upon movement, pain in jaw, swelling face, facial pain, dry mouth and suspected mumps. Mumps is assessed as not related, due to biological implausibility. For remaining events, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal relationship. Although reported symptoms were rather consistent with influenza-like-illness, reported influenza (flu symptoms) is assessed as not related.; Reporter's Comments: She had an odd reaction to Afluria shot.; Sender's Comments: A 70-year-old patient was vaccinated with Afluria Quadrivalent.

Due to concern for seizure, obtained neurology consult and started on VEEG which showed background consistent with prematurity but  no seizures and  HUS which was unremarkable. Neurology signed off.   GI: An apnea study with pH monitoring  performed given concern for reflux with Sandifer syndrome , results as follows:""very mild desaturation events are associated with brief central apnea. I doubt that these are clinically relevant. Reflux index is higher than expected for age. There are no associated vital sign changes, except for occasional mild desaturations as described above. The combination of the description of the BRUE and the increased reflux index makes it plausible that the infant had a reflux associated event and appropriately protected her airway.
