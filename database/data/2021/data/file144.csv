My regular doctor prescribed a 10 day script of Prednisone and it began to get better. A week or so afterward was when I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer (4/9/21) and the rash suddenly got much, MUCH worse - and it was everywhere! Legs, arms, torso. It itched INCREDIBLY badly. I asked my doctor for another script of Prednisone, but evidently they are remiss to give too much of that out for very long. I then went to a dermatologist that prescribed some topical cream (Desoximetasone) that did and continues to help. They also began to give me UV light treatments 2-3 times a week at increasing time amounts. It initially seemed to help but then began to get too painful, especially when the rash was particularly raging, so I stopped doing those and asked for more Prednisone. They eventually wrote me up for another stint of it though it seemed far less effective at this point. I was able to get into a different dermatologist at this point and had them examine me too. They took punch biopsies in both my arm and torso, which showed positive for Chronic Urticara. They started me on a heavy rotation of various antihistamines (at one point I was at 12 doses of 24 hour tablets a day) which never really seemed to do much. Knocked the itchiness down at that point, but the rash was always present and flared on a weekly-ish basis.

Body temperature remained volatile for about 2-3 hours, switching between extreme hot and cold in intervals of 15 minutes or so. In addition, within the first 30 minutes of the initial fever, high levels of pain occurred from base of the skull down through neck, shoulders, upper back, and upper left arm (side that received injection). This pain was similar to muscular body aches you would have with a flu infection, but much more intense. Any attempt at movement was excruciating - I could not even move my arm or adjust positions without crying outloud or whimpering. Around 14 hours post-injection, a different kind of pain appeared: this seemed like a nerve problem of sorts. There was a sensation of pins and needles throughout my entire body, not just concentrated near the injection site. It was somewhat like the sensation we have when a limb ""falls asleep"" and produces tingling pain, but again, the intensity of the sensation was notable. The pins-and-needles, full-body nerve pain lasted for about 2 or 3 hours. The muscular pain that was concentrated around my neck, shoulders, and injection site lasted for about 5 hours, after which the arm that had received the injection was still very stiff and sore for the next day. However, the soreness in neck, shoulders, and upper back subsided after about 5 hours. The fever and chill cycles began to slow down after about 3 hours and stabilized within about 6 hours. I didn't attempt to treat any of the side effects, partly because I was immoblized by pain and fatigue, and partly because I wasn't sure if there were more effects to follow. The reaction began about 13 hours after receiving the vaccine, and with the exception of soreness at injection site, the symptoms resolved by about 18 hours post-injection.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/29/2021,04/29/2021,0,,PUB,,"NuvaRing, Ritalin",none,depression,,,2,12/17/2021,,,,none

(My body temperature is regularly 96.7 F, but registered up to 99.8 F at the highest point I measured). Within 30 minutes of the fever, I began experiencing rapid cycling between fever and chills. The chills were so strong that my whole body was shivering uncontrollably and the surface of my skin was painful. Within the first hour after onset of the fever, I began experiencing muscular aches from my neck down into the injection site, making it difficult to move. Around the same time,  I began to experience what I would describe as nerve pain - a ""pins and needles"" tingling sensation that I felt throughout my entire body. The surface of my skin was especially noticeably painful (the fever and chill cycles continued during the muscular and nerve pain). The rapid changes in body temperature began to slow and reduce in intensity after about 5 hours. The nerve pain lasted for about 3 hours, during which I was unable to rest, unable to move effectively, but also unable to stay completely still because of the sharpness of the tingling nerve pains. The muscular soreness around my neck, shoulders, and injection site lessened throughout the day and seemed mostly resolved by approx 10 hours after onset (about 20 hours post-injection). However, full-body muscular soreness set in around 22 hours post-injection - I suspect this might have been due to my muscles tensing up so much and so frequently during the chill cycles. Whole body felt sore until about 30 hours post-injection. I DID experience bad side effects from my second dose of the Moderna vaccine and the side effects from the booster are very similar in nature. The differences are: with dose #2, side effects began 13 hrs post-injection, were very severe for about 6 hours, and almost completely subsided by 24hrs post-injection; by contrast, side effects from the Moderna booster began earlier (10 hours post-injection) and lasted much longer (still experiencing pain 30+ hours after injection), but the effects did not seem as intense with the booster vs the 2nd full dose (2nd dose pain was too strong to move at all, booster di.

Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus Sgg (formerly known as S. bovis type I) is the main causative agent of septicemia and infective endocarditis (IE) in elderly and immunocompromised persons. It belongs to the few opportunistic bacteria, which have been strongly associated to colorectal cancer (CRC). A literature survey covering a period of 40 years (1970?2010) revealed that 65% of patients diagnosed with an invasive Sgg infection had a concomitant colorectal neoplasia. Sgg is associated mainly with early adenomas and may thus constitute an early marker for CRC screening.  Fecal occult blood positive 10/04/2019.

I had a telehealth appointment and the doctor informed me this was a sign of shingles (Hutchinson sign). I went immediately to urgent care. They did a corneal dye exam and found no lesions on my cornea. The physician prescribed a 7 day prescription of valacyclovir 1g tablets x3/day. I had flu like symptoms and fatigue but did not develop a cold sore on my nose, or any rash at all. I had chicken pox as a child (about 5yrs) and am unvaccinated against chicken pox as well as shingles. I have never had shingles before.   Tuesday 12/14 I woke up feeling ill and had pain behind my left ear.  Wednesday 12/15 I noticed little blisters behind my ear. I went to urgent care and they diagnosed me with a recurrence of shingles, but said my ear drum was clear. Physician prescribed me another round of valacyclovir 1gm 3/day.

She wanted to return home after her visit there.  She was saturating  well around 90% prior to discharge.  ABGs at that time revealed a pO2 of 58.5,  pCO2 of 28.  She was given a dose of bamlanivimab and etesevimab (700  mg/1,400 mg) x1 and was discharged back to her apartment.  At rest, she did  pretty well with her O2 sats remaining in the 90+ percent range while, but any activity caused desaturations in the mid 80% range.  I talked  with her son the day before this admission and suggested she go to the  emergency room, but she refused.  On the day of admission, she was still  coughing and short of breath maybe a little worse and she finally agreed to  come in for further evaluation.  She was seen in the ER on the day of  admission and CTA was obtained.  This revealed bilateral interstitial  infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia superimposed on her interstitial  changes.  She was given IV azithromycin and Rocephin and I was contacted.  She  was placed on IV heparin and is admitted at this time for further inpatient  treatment.  Her procalcitonin was mildly elevated at 0.12.  CRP was 113.   White count was 7.45 with no shift.  Chemistries looked good.  Renal function  was stable and her troponin was mildly elevated at 0.108.  BNP was normal at  85.  She was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of hypoxemic respiratory  failure secondary to COVID pneumonia with superimposed underlying interstitial  lung disease. She was felt to be sick enough to be in the hospital as we noted.  She was  saturating well on 3 L nasal cannula.  She was begun on Decadron 6 mg daily,  begun empirically on IV antibiotic coverage in light of her elevated sed  inflammatory markers, which may all be secondary to underlying COVID, but we  did cover her with Rocephin and azithromycin.    Her hospital stay was approximately 6 days.  She did get worse for the first  couple of days requiring higher O2 requirements.  She was up to at most 5 L  nasal cannula.  There was never a problem with CO2 retention.  She remained  alert, oriented, and comfortable.  She had a nonproductive cough  intermittently at times and no chest pain or discomfort.  She never had any  febrile course, and all blood cultures remained negative.    We monitored her closely on a daily basis.  She remained on the COVID floor.   She had previously received Regeneron a week before, and the details of this  are outlined in the H and P.    With time, there was slow symptomatic improvement.  She still required oxygen  on the day of discharge, but her O2 requirements were such that we were able  to decrease her rest O2 down to 3 L nasal cannula.  Her pH was 7.44, pCO2 of  31, and pO2 of 62, and she was perfectly comfortable on these settings.  She  will need 4-5 L with activity.    She remained weak and is in need of further home care.  We felt that she may  require skilled care placement, but the family was determined to take her home  with them.  Her daughter took family leave and will be her caretaker, and she  has other children in the area and grandchildren, who can assist in her home  care.  We will arrange for home care as well.  Home O2 was arranged at 3 L at  rest, 4-5 L with exertion as noted.",,,,,Y,8,,,Y,02/02/2021,12/04/2021,305,11/23/21 COVID19: positive 11/30/21 chest xray: Patchy airspace disease most pronounced laterally within the left lung most consistent with mild changes of COVID-19 pneumonia.,UNK,,1.

Follows the nausea pattern 3. Diarrhea ? Follows the nausea pattern and will last for 5-10 days at a time. During those days I go 3-4 times an hour with no relief from medications. I end up going to the ER to get an IV because I cannot get off my bathroom floor. 4. Taste ? I never know what I can eat or drink even if I?m at the top of the arc and feel as good as I can with this going on. The worst offenders are chicken, bread, eggs, beer, carbonated drinks, pork, and chocolate. These items taste like they have been rotting in the sun for weeks and I?m forced to eat them. Other foods that are bad, but I can sometimes tolerate are beef, vegetables, milk, cheese, and corn tortillas. When I?m at my worst which lasts 5-10 days and can?t get anything in my system. Pure sugar candy like a Twizzler or Gummy bears can work. The only things I can drink are aloe vera drinks and blue Gatorade.  5. Can?t control emotions ? When I?m at my worst I cry uncontrollably or can?t control my anger to where I stay away from people. I?ve punched through a desk and a wall, flipped furniture over and then end up crying uncontrollably. I wouldn?t do it, but I have suicidal thoughts when I?m like this. When I?m at my best (which still sucks badly) I feel like I?m having a 24/7 panic attack. That feeling is always there and never leaves. 6. Dizziness to where I must hold a wall or sit down. 7. Cold sweats 8. Shaking  9. Get freezing cold in temperatures that shouldn?t bother me. 10. Sometimes the stomach issues hit so hard my entire body tingles like I just grabbed an electric fence.    Timing of symptoms: - Symptoms started late May or early June about a week after my second Pfizer vaccine shot. - Around that time, I also had a very simple hernia surgery.  - Earlier in the spring I had the Inspire System installed for sleep apnea. There is a device installed in my right pectoral muscle that powers the system. It connects to nerves in my neck that control my tongue. It was done by Dr. My operation was difficult because my nerves were a mess, so he had to cut a nerve in my neck that was in the way. I was told that this shouldn?t cause me any issues. I did have to wait 6 weeks before they turned it on to heal because the surgery was so difficult. The Inspire system was turned on fully about a month or so before my symptoms started.  I tried shutting it off for 2 weeks with no luck.  - General timings are completely random. Some days are worse in the morning and some in the evening. I?ve tried to narrow down food, drinks, amount of sleep, weather patterns, stress, and if I?m at my house or my sister?s where we run a company, but I can?t find anything consistent.  Physical activities tend to make symptoms come on faster.  I haven?t been able to exercise since this started.   Attempts to relieve the symptoms. 1.  Sleep ? sometimes helps, sometimes I?m worse when I wake up. 2. Nausea Meds ? I?ve had every over the counter and prescription medication there is. I?ve even had all those medications injected into me at the Emergency Room. None of these helped or even touched the symptoms. 3. Maximum strength prescription antacid. No help whatsoever. 4. Anti-Migraine pills at night. No help 5. Desipramine ? taken at night. No help 6. The only thing that even takes off an edge is cannabis. Before this started, I rarely ever used it.  Now I need it on a daily basis to function as a human.  7. Anti-diarrhea pills.

I was scared but didn?t look for doctors, I thought ?It must stop soon it is just a side effect from the vaccine and there is nothing that I can do about it.? My hair didn?t stop falling for about 4 months. I spoke with a lot of people and calmed down to learn they were experiencing the same type of side effect.

Depression. Anxiety Disorder. OCD. Bipolar.,FLU VACCINE,,2,12/17/2021,,,,"SULFUR: My body gets fully packed with red dots; PAXIL: My body gets fully packed with red dots; GREEN DYE: 02 different reactions: (1) GREEN ALOEVERA SHAMPOO (REACTION: Hair got completely dried out of its natural oil. Hair was like Michael Jackson from the time he belonged to a group named Jackson 5); (2) GREEN COUGH SYRUP (REACTION: I was hospitalized at 1:00 AM with Pneumonia. Doctor prescribed a strong cough syrup to give me a breath from so much coughing. After 05 minutes I was not able to breath. The other patient besides me, she screamed for help. Doctors came and saw my body fully red dotted, and I was turning my eyes for lack of air. I signal the doctor to ask color of medication. He said it was green. I signal back to him it was killing me. He gave me some antidote medication and after 10 minutes I was back to normal. I explained the doctor that just a week before my hair reacted to a green shampoo. Both reactions to green color happened for the first time. So, I don't use anything artificially colored green to be on the safe side). RED DYE: Used a red detergent to wash the dishes by hand. In just a few minutes my hands were so swollen that I couldn't hold any longer the dishes. My skin turned brownish like if the detergent was burning out my skin. I rinsed out my hands with a white bath soap and applied a white skin lotion. And I just waited my hands to return to normal. RECREATIONAL SODAS:  we call soda as ""refrigerant"". On my sister's birthday, I drank a glass of  soda, nationally known and loved by all. It was my first time drinking it. Its color is like yellow like a beer color. I experienced a terrible abdominal and stomach cramps for about 02 to 03 hours of contorting my body and screaming in pain. Nothing was done to help me but wait until the liquid be digested by my body. That is little town normal parent's behavior, hospital only if you are almost dead! Well, up until here, all these reactions took place where I used to live. FLU VACCINE: Here, I was advised to take the FLU vaccine. FIRST FLU VACCINE REACTION: I took for the first time and was rushed to the hospital as I felt like my body was crushing, shutting down, it is hard to explain? I got very dizzy, a horrible light headed feeling, difficulty to breath, high fever, and other things that I can't recall. After about 10 long years, friends convinced me that things change, and those vaccines get better formulation. SECOND FLU VACCINE REACTION: Same as the first one. Hospitalized until I feel back to normal. After another 10 long years, like a pure idiot, I trusted friends once again and took it. THIRD FLU VACCINE REACTION: Same as above. CONCLUSION: I will never take a FLU VACCINE again! HOT PEPPERS: Besides the horrible burning feeling from my lips until my stomach, it makes it difficult for me to breath. COVID-19 VACCINE REACTION: Here are the dates I took them: FIRST dosage (MODERNA) on 04/14/2021; SECOND dosage (MODERNA) on 05/13/2021; THIRD dosage ? booster (PFIZER) just today, 12/17/2021 ? and up until now, I am feeling OK. After taking all 03 dosages I stayed in the Pharmacies where I took them for about 15 minutes and afterwards, I was liberated to go home. About 24 to 48 hours after taking my FIRST dosage of MODERNA, my hair started to fall like crazy, meaning: hands full of hair! I thought I was going to lose it all. Everyday combing my hair was bringing tears to my eyes and lots of panic. I was scared but didn't look for doctors, I thought It must stop soon it is just a side effect from the vaccine and there is nothing that I can do about it? My hair didn't stop falling for about 4 months. I spoke with a lot of people and calmed down to learn they were experiencing the same type of side effect. They oriented me to take Vitamin E, Iron, and many other under the counter medications besides applying natural coconut oil in my hair to massage it. I lost about 40 percent of my soft and smooth hair. The hair left in my head became dry, it lost its natural oil. During shower, when I would collect hands full of hair, I would move my hair in my hands and it was like rubber, like being melted away. Not a great feeling, I can assure you.

His past history included febrile seizures at age 13 months.  On an unknown date, at age of 14 months, the patient was vaccinated with his first dose of varicella virus vaccine live (oka/merck) (VARIVAX) for prophylaxis (exact dose, route, anatomical location, lot# and expiration date were not reported). On an unknown date at age of 26 months, he experienced febrile seizures. On an unknown date, at age of 49 months, he was vaccinated with measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (oka-merck) virus vaccine live (PROQUAD) (exact dose, route, anatomical location, lot# and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis.  On an unknown date, he experienced erythematous rash about 4 cm in diameter over the right knee. At a medical clinic, poison ivy was diagnosed and oral prednisolone was prescribed at a daily dosage of 20 mg for 7 days (0.8 mg/kg/day). Cytokine inflammatory profiles in the CSF patient's sample was analyzed. The 10 most elevated cytokines in patient's CSF samples included: interferon gamma (75.76), interleukins: IL-1RA (184.63); IL-6 (90.57), IL-8 (4034.30), IL-10 (75.39), and IL-17F (348.68); chemokines CCL2 (616.79), CXCL9 (81.16), and CXCL10 (1178.58); as well as G-CSF (55.79) (units not provided for all).   On an unknown, 17 days after, he developed a headache, followed a few hours later by low grade fever. Next day, his headaches worsened, and he began to vomit. Vomiting continued over the next 24 h whenever his parents attempted to feed him. When the vomiting persisted into the second day, he was admitted to a local hospital for intravenous (IV) hydration. After spending one night at the local hospital, he was transferred to a medical center. On admission, the child was in obvious pain. His physical examination did not disclose any rashes or abnormalities in major organ systems. Although the neurology examination was difficult to perform, he had mild nuchal rigidity but no focal neurological abnormalities. His non-contrast head computerized tomography (CT) imaging was normal. His initial laboratory testing included the following values: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 14 mm; C-reactive protein (CRP): 0.5 mg/L; white blood cell count = 4000/mm3 with 1790 neutrophils, 1130 lymphocytes, and 380 eosinophils all per mm3. His hemoglobin was 12.2 gm/dL; aspartate aminotransferase /alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT): 20/30 units/L and his urinalysis was normal. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was hazy with a glucose of 50 mg/dL, total protein of 60 mg/dL, and nucleated cell count of 544 cells/mm3 with mainly lymphocytes. A multiplex meningitis/encephalitis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for both varicella zoster virus (VZV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6). Because the preliminary diagnosis was VZV meningitis (Herpes zoster meningitis), treatment with acyclovir, intravenous (IV) at 30 mg/kg/day was initiated. His VZV-specific IgM and IgG antibody titers detected by immunofluorescence were positive at titers of 1:4 and 1:64, respectively. Because the Before meningitis panel had a positive HHV6 signal and the metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay detected HHV7 sequences but no HHV6 sequences, testing for both HHV6 and HHV7 antibodies was performed. The patient had detectable IgG antibodies to both HHV6 and HHV7 at a titer of 1:16. The IV acyclovir was stopped after 4 days, when the child was markedly improved and his headaches resolved. He was discharged on a regimen of valacyclovir (500 mg three times daily) for 10 more days. The child was seen several times during the 18 months post discharge. His recovery from meningitis was complete.   The relatedness between the event and suspect vaccines was considered as related as the authors reported that meningitis was caused by the live varicella vaccine virus. The relatedness between the event and prednisolone was considered as related as it was concluded that ingestion of an oral corticosteroid burst 3�4 weeks before onset of vaccine meningitis may be a risk factor and treatment with a prednisolone burst at a relatively high dosage likely allowed latent vaccine virus to reactivate.

A 34 year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) 21 days after first dose, administered in deltoid left/ left shoulder (Batch/Lot number: unknown) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Past drug history included: Cefazolin, notes: Preoperative intravenous cefazolin (1 g) was given.

Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate mesh reinforcement was used inside the implant pocket; this product is routinely used by the author for augmentation/mastopexies to support both the parenchyma and the implant position. Tegaderm nipple shields, routinely used by the author for augmentations, were not used in this case due to the need to transpose the nipple-areolar complex. The implant was placed with an insertion funnel through a separate inframammary incision. Postoperatively she did well, and at 6 weeks, postoperative photographs demonstrate good implant position, and at 10 weeks, postop was noted to have good implant position with soft and movable implants (Baker I) bilaterally. Vaccination history included: Bnt162b2 (Dose 1 (five months postoperatively received first dose of the Pfizer vaccine), Anatomical location: Left shoulder). The following information was reported: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST IMPLANT (hospitalization, medically significant), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""20 days after the second dose, seen to have a painful, distorted Baker IV capsular contracture""; LYMPHADENOPATHY (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""Six days after the second dose, she noted an enlarged lymph node in her left axilla""; HAEMATOMA (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""small delayed hematoma was the cause of the contracture""; BREAST SWELLING (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""Thirteen days after the second dose, she reported that her left breast was firm, swollen, and ""tight""."". Because of the severity of her symptoms, she underwent early revisional surgery with capsulectomy and implant exchange. Intraoperatively she was found to have an intact implant and a dense fibrotic capsule containing 37 cc of a thin reddish-brown fluid but no hematoma or organized blood clot. Although capsular contracture is typically thought of as a process that takes place over weeks to months, there is experimental evidence that provides a mechanism for capsular contracture evolving over only a few days, as seems to have occurred in this case. For example, tissue cultures obtained from the contracted capsules of women with silicone implants demonstrated the ability to induce a rapid upregulation of the genes for TGFB1, interleukin 8 as well as other inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines in vitro, which in turn, were thought to be responsible for the stimulation of contracture of fibroblast-populated collagen lattices over a 48- to 120-hour period. Another study also using tissue media derived from the capsules of women with implants showed enhanced T-cell proliferation and increased cytokine levels as compared to peripheral blood. These studies further support the concept of an immunologically mediated and rapid process for capsular contracture; the cellular composition of the capsule and the surrounding tissue seems poised to respond to an immunological stimulus. It is possible that the timing of the capsular contracture vis-a-vis the vaccine was a mere coincidence. The contracture occurred during the typical time frame for contracture (most are within the first year14), and it occurred following an operation (augmentation/mastopexy) that has a high contracture rate. In fact, the presence of a clearly hemorrhagic collection within the capsule raises an alternative hypothesis, that a small, delayed hematoma was the cause of the contracture. There are just over 30 case reports in the literature of hematomas occurring at least 6 months following cosmetic breast augmentation. Many of these had instigating events, such as trauma or physical strain or a recent iatrogenic coagulopathy, and many occurred in cases with aggressively textured implants, where the separation of the implant from the adherent capsule was thought to be the reason for the bleeding. This patient had none of these possible factors in her history. She denied trauma, was not engaged in implant displacement exercises or any kind of weightlifting, and her coagulation tests and platelet counts were normal. In delayed hematomas without a discernible etiology, the so-called called spontaneous cases, several authors suggest a variety of nonspecific inflammatory conditions as possible causes. Along these lines, the inflammatory response seen in a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (as in the aforementioned post-vaccine reactions to hyaluronic acid fillers) can induce angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability within days in animal models. Furthermore, the complex inflammatory and angiogenesis cascades share some of the same mediators, for example, TGFB1 and interleukin 820-22 and can be activated in concert. Therefore, the finding of a small amount of a bloody fluid in the capsule does not preclude an inflammatory, vaccine-induced mechanism for capsular contracture. Additionally, with the tight temporal sequence of events-the second dose of the vaccine, then lymph node enlargement, then a discernible tightening that rapidly progressed to a Baker IV contracture it seems hard to completely exculpate the vaccination as a possible cause, by one mechanism or another. It is also possible that the placement of the poly-4- hydroxybutyrate mesh in direct opposition to the implant contributed to the contracture, although the limited evidence that is available seems to suggest, if anything, that poly-4-hydroxybutyrate is more preventative than causative when it comes to capsular contracture. The ipsilaterally of the contracture to the vaccine site is also interesting; one might suspect that a systemic response to a vaccine would demonstrate no such side preference, although in this case there was an ipsilateral regional reaction with the enlarged lymph node. It would be premature to propose any protocol based upon a single case report. The pre-emptive use of zafirlukast has been suggested, for augmented patients getting the vaccine who experience any tightening, on at least 1 plastic surgical practice website and this makes sense from a mechanistic point of view. However, as a blanket recommendation for all augmented patients getting the vaccine, this would seem to treat many patients unnecessarily with a drug that is not entirely benign. Furthermore, even though zafirlukast acts upon a somewhat distal part of the immunological/inflammatory cascade (suppression of myofibroblasts), any interference with the body's immune response immediately after the vaccine might seem to be unwise and counterproductive to the entire point of the vaccine. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: coagulation test: normal; platelet count: normal. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of capsular contracture associated with breast implant with early revisional surgery with capsulectomy and implant exchange and for breast swelling with montelukast.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information in the case, a contributory effect of the vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be ruled out.

Caller reports that there was mention of a clinical trial but her daughter does not want to be a guinea pig. She also reports that now her daughter is experiencing some financial difficulty from her symptoms. Caller then reported that she also experienced internal itching with nothing on the surface of the skin, no rash but just internal itching for 5 weeks after getting vaccinated, she was vaccinated near the same time as her daughter but at a different location, but she reports that her itching was a milder case than her daughters and it has now resolved. She reports that she took Benadryl a couple times a night, but had no rash or issues with her skin. She only experienced the symptoms during the day. Caller reports that she herself is afraid to get the booster dose being offered because she does not want to get the symptoms to the extent that her daughter has it.

All of her tests have been normal, nothing was found. The nerve test and all the bloodwork everything was negative. Her daughter takes birth control pills, Junel FE, but there is no interaction. When probing which arm she received the Covid 19 vaccines in she thinks the right arm because that is the arm that her daughter moves the most.

Relevant laboratory tests and procedures are available in the appropriate section. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of palpitations, condition aggravated.  Additional information: After her second Pfizer covid vaccine, about three weeks later she had heart palpitations, she went to ER after never having them before in her life. She had tests done and she wore a heart monitor for 30 days. She saw a cardiologist and was told it was benign. Her heart palpitations progressively got a little worse after having them for a while after that second dose and then she went to ER on a Sunday. She was not admitted. About 4 to 6 weeks later it was gone. She is scared to death about taking the booster. She is thinking about getting the Moderna booster instead. She will probably have her antibodies checked. Clarifies that her heart palpitations started in Apr2021 and were gone by May or beginning of Jun2021. She had several visits to the cardiologist. She was given a medication called propafenone hcl 150mg that was supposed to help regulate the heart palpitations, but it didn't do anything for it. She thinks she had covid in Feb2020. The first two weeks of Feb2020 she thought she had the flu and did not have pneumonia according to the chest x-ray. Tested negative for the flu. She was sent home with antibiotics and steroids and neither one of those seemed to help. She would wake up in the middle of the night thinking she could not get her next breath. Her lungs did not wheeze they crackled. She no longer has the steroids or antibiotic to provide lot, ndc, or expiration date. She lost her sense of taste and smell and lost 8 pounds. She made herself get up and walk. Reports they picked up something in her lower right lung when doing a CT for something else, thought it was a nodule and it disappeared. They were following it for 9 months and then it disappeared. Reports she had low oxygen levels ever since she covid last year, she was always told to breathe since her oxygen was low in the 80s but at her last doctors visit it was normal. When she thought she had covid, her blood pressure was up and her blood pressure medication had to be doubles and it is not because she lost weight, she does not know why that occurred. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect reported as none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

This chill had happened with my previous two vaccine rounds, but not to the degree I was currently experiencing (I did not report the previous chill experiences because I thought that was to be an expected side effect). It?s still something that I knew what it was as soon as I felt it coming on.   So, as I?m continuing to shiver with my teeth chattering, I go to stand up and my muscles start to tense up. I was able to make it over to my bed and as soon as I laid down, the shivering & teeth chattering continued. And then my body went stick-straight as all my muscles tensed - I could not even move my arms to reach over to my cell phone, or to even hit the emergency SOS on my Apple Watch.  And while I live with a roommate, she was out for the evening, so I was completely alone in this, being unable to at the least even call for help. And I didn?t at the time even know how long this would last. Scariest moment of my life. The entire episode lasted maybe 30 minutes before I was able to move again.

Even now, on December 18th, has there been anything reported. Get off your butts and start taking care the public. You aren't even asking the question! Since I've gone public in late October telling everyone, there are at least  4 people who have had menstruation screwups including another ""dry"" 50-year old who started bleeding after 10 years in my primary's office. And you wonder why people don't trust you or these shots? YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.  It also appears that younger women are losing early-stage pregnancies and experiencing very heavy menstrual cycles. But of course, our government won't share that information either. If I were a young woman, I would in no way take these shots. And what about the poor people who can't afford to get medical testing and now have to live with similar issues? I will be happy to produce my insurance reports and tests as proof of the anguish and pain I had to go through alone in this. I will not be a sheep any longer.  How dare you push people to get a drug and doesn't even provide full disclosure of risks and side effects. And a visit with an optician this week, he said he's seeing double the people coming in his office with double vision and wondering if this too is a side effect of the vaccines.

I was half asleep and wasn?t sure what was happening, but my body was aching and I felt extremely exhausted; I wound up falling back asleep.  Two hours later I woke up again at 6:00am and the same exact thing happened again, I felt even more tired and my whole body hurt, I fell asleep again. I woke 30 minutes later (6:30am) to the same exact involuntary jerk of my arms going straight up, my legs pointing straight down, my torso contorted with my top half pushing out one way and my bottom half pushing out the opposite way and it was extremely, extremely painful, and my head was pounding. After that last involuntary convulsion I started having one every 5 minutes and I had no control over it. I started freaking out and was crying because it was so scary not to be able to control my body and being in so much pain. I thought I was going to have this condition for the rest of my life.  I called several friends who were nurses and then my doctor who told me if it doesn?t go away or slow down in a few hours to go to the immediate care.

However I also had intense joint pain in the shoulder joint that radiated down my entire arm, limiting my range of motion and ability to lift / carry anything in that hand and arm.  This pain felt like a pinched nerve pain.  At the same time, pain also radiated into my upper left chest that felt muscular in nature, like a pulled muscle or something.  Neither was present before the booster and both developed the day after the booster.  All this lasted about a week before it improved any.  While it has mostly improved, even now, 2 months out from the booster, the shoulder joint pain, upper arm muscle pain, and chest muscle pain will recur occasionally at varying degrees of discomfort and I am certain it is booster related.  Again, none of this was present before the booster and was full onset the day after the booster.  I did not report this to my MD or to the Walgreens that administered the vaccine as I do not feel that either could do anything to remedy the issue.  Of note, the pharmacist that gave me the shot was very adamant about not using ice / ice pack to soothe the injection site of any discomfort because it would ""ruin the shot.""  This is in direct contrast to what I have since read about treatment of injection site discomfort.  But I followed her directions in case she knew something more than what I was reading about it.  I also do not expect the CDC to acknowledge this as a legit experience as the CDC has proven to not be very transparent, forthcoming, and reliable with the truth and is in the pocket of the liberal administration.  Also of note, I had ""COVID arm"" after the first vaccine, which I also reported.  It was in the same arm, my non-dominant arm.  My second shot was in the opposite arm as my first arm site was still recovering from COVID arm reaction to the first shot.  These reactions are in my opinion extreme and not natural.  I have had many vaccines in my life and never had anything like this.  2 out of the 3 COVID vaccines I have had, all Pfizer, created significant physical reactions to the injection arm that lingered for some time.

Procedure in Detail: After informed consent was obtained the patient was transported to the OR. A timeout was performed and perioperative antibiotics were given. The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.   A 12mm port was inserted in the umbilical position under direct visualization and the abdomen was insufflated. A 5mm 30 degree laparoscope was introduced. Two additional ports were inserted, one in the suprapubic position and one in the left lower quadrant, under direct laparoscopic visualization without incident. There were numerous dilated small bowel loops with distally decompressed bowel loops as well as serous fluid throughout the peritoneal cavity, likely a reaction to the distal small bowel obstruction. The appendix was tucked under the distal ileal mesentery, where it had perforated, and upon mobilizing the distal ile um and its mesentery an abscess cavity was released, draining purulent fluid which was suctioned out. The appendix had a blown-out hole in its mid-body. The appendix was exposed and retracted anteriorly and inferiorly, splaying open the appendiceal mesentery. A window was made in the appendiceal mesentery with the Maryland ligasure cautery and then the appendiceal mesentery was then taken with the ligasure cautery. The base of the appendix was transected with an endoGIA stapler. The appendix was removed via the umbilical port site using a specimen retrieval bag and then the peritoneal cavity was suctioned out. The small bowel was run proximally starting at the terminal ileum, and some loose fibrinous adhesions from the small intestine to the proximal rectum/distal sigmoid were released bluntly. The transition point of the obstruction was positively identified and easily released. We ran the bowel proximally for several more feet, and there were no other points of obstruction. The bowel was still fairly dilated but was all viable.   Once this was completed the surgical bed was inspected and the staple line was noted to be intact and the hemostasis was adequate. A rectus sheath block was performed using 0.2% plain ropivacaine under laparoscopic visualization. The ports were removed under direct visualization and the abdomen was desufflated. The incisions were closed in layers with absorbable sutures, cleaned and dried, and sterile dressings were applied.",,,Y,,Y,7,,,N,12/02/2021,12/07/2021,5,"Ultrasound with finding of appendicitis on 12/13 CT scan with finding of possible perforated appendix and obstruction of bowl 12/13 laprascopic surgery on 12/13 2:00pm confirming appendix blown out and obstruction.

By evening it wasn't just red but raised welts and painful. I could even feel welts in my ear canals. The skin on the back of my head and neck felt weird and stiff.  I went to urgent care the next day. The provider there didn't know what caused it and did not believe it is related to the vaccine, and gave me a steroid shot and prescriptions for oral steroids and antihistamines. By that evening the itchiness has spread to the palms of my hands and bottoms of my feet. However the sensation was less painful and itchy and I was able to sleep.  The next day I didn't feel itchy, however my skin was very prone to getting red where touched. This continued even after I ran out of steroids after 10 days. I saw a dermatologist who was convinced it was from the vaccine, doesn't want me to get any more covid shots, and urged me to see an allergist. I will be seeing an allergist on 12/20/21.

1962851,12/20/2021,NJ,38.0,38,,M,,"About 36 hours after my dose, or the 2nd night, I woke up at 6am with a racing heartbeat of 90-100 beats per minute.  My normal sleeping heart rate is in the mid to high 40's, or low 50's. I had no idea why my heart was racing at 90-100 beats per minute but I quickly realized there was something wrong.   Waiting at the hospital waiting room it was consistenly around 83 bpm, very high from my normal resting heart rate of 53.   I also had some vague chest tightness but only for a few moments, and a vague pain, again, only for a few moments.  Mostly very rapid heart rate that lasted for HOURS.  and a lot of shortness of breath.  They did tests for some hours and could not find anything officially heart-wise and as I was laying there trying to relax my heart rate came down slightly, into the 70's and touching 69 I was lay still and as relaxed as I could, so they discharged me.  Back in the car my bpm was back in the 80's as I was no longer laying down and while driving home back to 100ish, but I felt a bit better knowing I wasn't having a life threatening issue in the moment.   I was fortunately able to sleep, making sure to keep my arm at my side in bed and not putting even 1 bit of pressure on my chest, and not sleeping on my side or my chest, as I slept on my side that night of the problem and that is when my heart started fluttering I believe.   So if I lay in bed on my back and lay completley still, I have been able to sleep and not feel wierd chest feelings as I normally might.  But the scariest part now is the extreme shortness of breath.  The first day after (day 3 from shot - Thursday, shot was Monday at 4:30pm) I could barely go 5 steps without being completely winded.  I could barely go up or down stairs, or do much of anything.  Each day I get just slightly..better...as now on day 5 I can go up the stairs in only 1 minute...instead of 2.  I still have to go step by step and it feels like I am climbing a mountain and then am very tired and must rest.  I am hoping I continue to get better but I am very concerned if this will have any long term health effects for me, as that is the entire reason why I avoided covid to such a great degree, as I knew I had some kind of allergic asthmya like condition perhaps, but not officially asthyma (that I know of.)    Presently now Sunday night day 6, my heart rate is often in the 70's although when sleeping and resting it does go down to mid 40's during sleep and 50s sometimes when still.  but other times sitting still it can be 70's or 80's which is abnormal and my ox level often goes to down to 93, while I am sitting and doing no movement.  It also often says 96 or 97, again while doing...nothing. and being still.   While walking just a few steps it went down to 89 on the first or 2nd day.  I have not exerted myself much as I cannot much, and out of fear of creating another problem, or something worse.       I was givin no treatment and they told me I had ""stress"", which clearly I do not, I was as relaxed as possible which thankfully brought the bpm down to 69/70's range, but for me that is still much elevated and I knew something was not right, but I understood that they likely could not find anything and it was getting busier and they likely had to fill the beds with others.    I am on day 6 and this feels like it could last likely weeks, or months, again, I have been given no medication and have no diagnosis and medical professionals and been of very little help, besides doing some tests and watching me during the intial heart rate issue.   This issue must be studied much more to understand what is happening and it is unnaceptable that not enough people know these risks.",,,Y,,,,,,N,12/13/2021,12/15/2021,2,"They did EKG, T test and chest x-ray, I was told nothing specific found, which I read also happened to someone else, who later nearly died of it, and had to have his chest opened up in surgery.

I do have costochondritis history and it is normal for me to have some minor pain around my heart and chest as I rest my hand while holding my phone while I read in bed, probably about 1 hour + per day. I was concerned about the costochondritis and the Moderna vaccine, but as I took the Pfizer 2x, and had no problem, and Moderna was providing better protection, I figured I would probably be OK to get that. Way wrong decision and now that I see how dangerous the Moderna vax is, it is very, very concerning. This data was not made well known to me how only every 1 in 23,000 locally got it from Moderna so our media has not done a good job giving this information, and I hope I can sue in 2024, as it is ridiculous to keep telling people these vaccines are safe when people are dying from them routinely. Especially if one has a condition like costochondritis, but was not listed on the questionnaire as a possible problem. Horrible.","I have a history of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, and at one time agoraphobia. I spent 2 years in a dorm room by myself in college, but later recovered from most of those issues with therapy and medication. So for the last many years I just take 1/2 of my escitalopram dose, and I am mentally quite healthy. As mentioned - the costochondritis - so I thought I was maybe having a heart attack a few years ago and went to the hospital but was diagnosed as costochondritis (I was helping with my sick mom, lifting her a lot, and apparently that repeated movement led to the sharper or more concerning muscle spasm near my heart I was feeling). I routinely feel occasional odd feelings, it feels like almost like little bruising over my chest plate and heart area from putting weight down as I hold my phone, and then sleep on it. I also routinely have a pain in that same spot under my heart, when I am in a rush and bend over to tie my shoes before leaving, I think lack of oxygen to that spot perhaps, and it gets very sore, just in the spot, for about 5-10 seconds as I bend over a bit out of breath. Right under my heart in the same spot I had the scary spasms that time. So I routinely have some odd symptoms, whether costo or some other condition, I do not know, but that was the diagnoses I was given at that time.",,,2,12/20/2021,,Y,Y,"Sometimes I wake up and my tonsil or thing that hangs from your throat.

So I don't know what I am allergic to, but I seem to have a strange allergic reaction, especially if my room window is closed and the room is too dusty, (this is why I stayed indoors for nearly 2 years...trying NOT to get Covid and now I have Covid like symptoms and likely myocarditis from the vaccine)."

I was still very sick with fevers and all the symptoms mentioned above.  He took 13 vials of blood and immediately put me on Chloroquine 250 mg/once a day.  My CRP was 126 at the time.   Two days after taking the Chloroquine I woke up and felt like I could actually take a deep breath.  At that point I felt like maybe I would get better.  After being on Chloroquine for 6 months once a day and last few weeks once every other day.  I had bloodwork taken every few weeks and visits to doctor.

He told me at that point he was sure the reaction had been caused by the  covid vaccine because he said there is no way everything would have resolved in 6 months on the Chloroquine if it was anything else.

The medication didn't help and only seemed to make it worse.  I was referred to a gastroenterologist in May 2021 and was not able to see my doctor until June 2021. At the time I received the second shot where I began to have ear-burning pain and numbness sensation in my face. I was having numbness around my nostrils, mouth, and cheeks. The ear burning would feel like it's inside my ear canal. My primary care doctor saw no issue in my ears but suggested a gastroenterologist anyway. My gastro suggested I do an endoscopy with bravo and the findings stated I was not having sufficient acid reflux to have the symptoms I was having. Especially the ear burning, he suggested that could be an allergy but did not order an allergy test and I was advised to see an ENT instead. My ENT did an allergy test which came back negative. My ENT also did a barium swallow to confirm no heartburn and everything was negative and I am still having ear-burning pain, minty /hot throat. It is debilitating and painful where it disrupts my way of life constantly.  I currently have no treatment and am dealing with this every day.   My ENT has suggested TMJ as the cause but I had never had any jaw issues in my life up until receiving the vaccine. He is also not 100% sure as some of my symptoms do not line up with the TMJ symptoms. I am still trying to get a diagnosis 6-7 months later.

I was also unable to eat without nausea and indigestion (which I had never experienced before) and began experiencing EXTREME bloating and severe abdominal pain. I went to Emergency Room on April 22 - two weeks after receiving the vaccine due to above listed symptoms. A CT scan revealed no blockages. They gave me antacids and morphine, neither of which reduced the pain or nausea. I saw a GI Specialist Dr. on April 27 who thought it might be an ulcer and prescribed me medication that made me feel worse. I discontinued the medication and saw Dr., another GI Specialist, who performed endoscopy and Colonscopy. I have the reports from that procedure which note inflammation/gastritis and no evidence of chronic illness (because I have no history of GI Issues and was healthy until the vaccine). Dr. diagnosed me with SIBO, gave me some antibiotics and referred me to a nutritionist. My symptoms continued to worsen and my hair started falling out. I am now being treated by Dr. from Nutrition Dept. It has been nearly a year and I am still disabled. I experience extreme bloating which prevents me from moving or eating and I cannot eat very many foods. I cannot work and have had to drop out of school.

1963633,12/20/2021,WI,15.0,15,,F,,"In brief, patient is a previously healthy 15 year old who had acute headache and collapse at home, concern for posturing versus seizure, and ultimately found to have cerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage with mass effect secondary to ruptured aneurysm. S/p coiling of aneurysm, bilateral EVD placement and R decompressive craniectomy. She has acute respiratory failure, strep viridans bacteremia, and concurrent COVID-19 infection.  Presented 12/2/21 with aneurysm and incidentally found to be COVID positive.   NEURO: On arrival, she was somewhat responsive and by the time she arrived at ED she was posturing versus seizing. Head CT revealed hemorrhage 3x3x3 hemorrhagic focus anterior and inferior to the right basal ganglion with mass effect, also with intraventricular blood in lateral and third ventricles with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in suprasellar cistern and bilateral sylvian fissures. At that time, reportedly pupils equal, 3-4, minimally reactive. At ED, received Mannitol bolus, and 4mg Ativan administered. Flight for Life activated and upon arrival to CW was admitted to the PICU with plan for emergent EVD placement. Neurosurgery placed EVD at bedside. Repeat head CT and CTA performed and demonstrated bilobed aneurysm arising from right ICA terminus with enlarging intraparenchymal hematoma along superior aspect mostly likely representing a ruptured aneurysm, increased intraventricular hemorrhage, similar subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased mass effect, effacement of basal cisterns, worsened midline shift. Optimized neuroprotection management with sedation, neuromuscular blockade, ventilator management, and hypertonic saline. R pupil became dilated and nonreactive and patient demonstrated persistently elevated ICPs >50. She underwent emergent IR coiling and R decompressive craniectomy with second right-sided EVD placement. Patient continued to demonstrate ICPs in 20s. Worked with Neurosurgery to optimize sedation. Repeat head CT demonstrated increased hypoattenuation in right frontal and parietal lobes, left parietal lobe, and splenium of corpus callosum. Loss of gray-white differentiation concerning for ischemic change. Increased right to left midline shift. TCDs demonstrated moderate spasm of the L MCA. EEG without seizure. Started Pentobarbital coma. On 12/9, an occurred episode while in transport to MRI and patient was noted to be obtunded. ICP 11 during episode, EVDs patent. She was not connected to LTM during episode, as she was in transport. She was started on epi drip and became more responsive, moving spontaneously and withdrawing to pain. On 12/10, her neurostorming medication regimen was optimized and no further changes were made.    Given poor neurologic prognosis, patient was given adequate sedation for pain management during terminal extubation on 12/18.  CV: Had periods of hypotension intraoperatively requiring initiation of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine infusions to maintain goal MAP > 80, SBP > 120. Returned to PICU with femoral CVL, arterial line, sedated with Fentanyl and Dexmedetomidine infusions, and on Vecuronium infusions, Nimodipine. On 12/4 echocardiogram report noted significant for left ventricular mid-inferoseptal hypokinesis and moderately diminished left ventricular systolic function, with an LVEF 41%. She required titration of pressors to maintain goal pressures. Added stress dose Hydrocortisone. Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated significant improvement in LV systolic function, consistent with the hypothesis that myocardium was neurologically stunned. 12/6-12/8 Patient weaned from sedation and pressors. On 12/9 she experienced a hypotensive episode while in transport to MRI.  HR dropped to 40s-50s. 105 mcg Epi dwindle given, then started on Epi drip, given 500 mL NS push pull. HR and BP normalized. On 12/10, patient was weaned from pressors and stress dose steroids. She remained hemodynamically appropriate leading to terminal extubation on 12/18.   RESP: Intubated in the OR. Notably, course complicated by significant pulmonary edema with poor compliance. On 12/10, her ventilator settings were weaned to CPAP/PS. She remained hemodynamically appropriate with CPAP/PS until terminal extubation on 12/18.   FEN/GI: On 12/10 patient was started on enteral feeds which were discontinued after terminal extubation on 12/18.   ID: At ED, she was incidentally found to be COVID positive. Blood cultures were drawn at that time positive for strep viridans. She started on empiric Cefepime and Vancomycin due to concern for septic shock given pressor requirements. Initiated thermoregulation. Patient continued to be intermittently febrile and remained on Ceftriaxone per family's wishes until 12/19.   RENAL: Initially had significantly increased urine output. Labs concerning for DI, although could also be secondary to 3% boluses. Initiated DI protocol. This later resolved and she continued to have urine output appropriate for age leading to her terminal extubation on 12/18.   OTHER: On 12/5 ,discussion took place between provider and mother and placed partial code status, including no bolus cardiac resuscitative medications, no defibrillation, no chest compressions. Care Conference took place on 12/10, during which mother voiced she would like to get MRI for further neuroprognostication before changing goals of care. Care conference on 12/14 to discuss MRI results with family. Neurology explained likely deficits patient will experience as a result of her brain injury including weakness of both sides of her body, inability to walk, inability to effectively eat PO, personality changes, cognitive dysfunction. Mother voices ""Patient would not want to live like this,"" but requests time to discuss these options with family before making any decisions. Another discussion between providers and family on 12/15 during which family voiced they would not want patient to be reintubated once extubated, would not want her to receive blood products, and would like to continue with enteral feeding. Tentative plans for extubation on 12/17 or 12/18 once family from out of state has come to say their goodbyes. Family later decided to move forward with terminal extubation on 12/18. She was extubated 12/18 to room air and passed away on 12/19/2021 @ 20:37 PM with mother, brother and step father at the bedside.",Y,12/19/2021,,,Y,17,,,N,06/19/2021,12/02/2021,166,"Head CT, MRI, Echocardiogram, multiple ultrasounds, angiogram",UNK,,Unknown,Unknown,None,,,2,12/20/2021,,,Y,No known allergies.

After reading the EKG that he ran he did state that he did believe that the wall around he heart was swollen.

Upon getting up, I realized it was only my right ear that had the ringing, tinnitus, underwater muffled head pounding and complete hearing loss. I went to my PCP that day who confirmed it was not a blockage or infection and gave me 125 mg steroid shot immediately to calm the immune/inflammatory reaction. She referred me to an ENT specialist who I saw the next day, on December 9th, who has seen this unfortunate reaction in all three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. He checked my hearing to confirm the difference between the ears and total loss in the right ear. I was prescribed high dose oral Prednisone for 17 days and have still seen no results at all. I still have complete unilateral hearing loss and bad tinnitus and discomfort in my right side of the head, I can barely function.

Patient is a 79-year-old female with history of hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED on 12/08 with complaints of cough and shortness of breath.  He was seen at urgent care several days prior to presentation, diagnosed with COVID, and placed on Tessalon Perles with discharge home.  Upon presentation to the emergency department, he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 88/59.  He was hypoxemic, and placed on 100% non-rebreather mask.  EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block.  Chest x-ray showed pneumonia, consistent with COVID.  Due to his low blood pressure readings, he was given a 500 mL bolus of normal saline.  Due to concerns for superimposed bacterial infection, he was given IV Rocephin and azithromycin, as well as IV Decadron, and admitted to the hospitalist service for further management.   Upon admission, he was transitioned to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen.  Decadron, Rocephin and azithromycin were continued.  He was switched from non-rebreather to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen for admission.  He was started on Remdesivir, but this was stopped secondary to bradycardia.  Due to the severity of his bradycardia, cardiology was consulted.  They recommended continuing telemetry monitoring, and placed a 14-day Zio patch at discharge, and to avoid AV nodal blocking agents.   He had a rather significant increase in D-dimer by 12/13, so CTA thorax and bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler were obtained.  He was noted to have small bilateral pulmonary emboli as well as nonocclusive, mobile thrombus in the right common femoral vein.  He was placed on Lovenox 1 mg/kg twice daily.  This was later transitioned to Eliquis 10 mg twice daily.  He will continue on Eliquis 10 mg twice daily at discharge, with decreased to 5 mg twice daily after 7 days.  He has 10 you on Eliquis for at least 6 months of therapy.   During hospitalization, we were able to gradually wean his oxygen down.  He was able to discharge on room air.

There is very mild respiratory motion. A distal subsegmental embolus is seen in the posterior basal left lower lobe (2:195). A subsegmental embolus is also seen in the right lateral lower lobe (2:181). There may be a small subsegmental embolus in the left lower lobe (2:208). No central/main pulmonary artery embolus. No suspicious adenopathy is seen in the mediastinum or hila. Calcified lymph nodes are visible. No adenopathy in the axillary region or visualized base of the neck. No pericardial or pleural effusion. No central airway obstruction. Mild bronchial wall thickening. No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. No pericardial effusion. Small pleural effusions.   Extensive patchy bilateral groundglass opacities are again seen involving all lobes of the lung. Overall, disease has slightly improved compared to 12/9/2021. Mild dependent lower lobe opacities are seen adjacent to small pleural effusions, probably atelectasis.   Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrates incomplete visualization of suspected right hydronephrosis. Only the upper pole of the right kidney was included in the image field-of-view. A left renal cyst is also probably present, unchanged. No destructive bone lesion is identified.   ____________________ Impression:    1.  Small bilateral pulmonary emboli, as above.  2.

Mediastinum & Hila: There are partially calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes due to old benign granulomatous disease. The esophagus is unremarkable.   Cardiovascular: The heart is enlarged and atherosclerotic plaque is present on the coronary arteries. There is no pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is not aneurysmal and there is no dissection. There is no evidence for right heart strain.   Pulmonary Arteries: No pulmonary embolism is present.   Lungs & Airways: The tracheobronchial structures are normal. There is extensive mixed semisolid and groundglass density alveolar infiltrate throughout the upper lobes more significantly involving the right upper lobe with underlying septal thickening. There are similar densities within the central portions of the right lower lobe. More dense alveolar opacities are present in both posterior costophrenic sulci. A component of this is due to atelectasis but superimposed aspiration or bacterial pneumonia could appear similar.   Pleural Space: There is a small pleural effusion on the right side.   Upper Abdomen: There is a small sliding-type hiatus hernia. A cyst is present at the superior pole of the left kidney.   Chest Wall & Musculoskeletal: There is a small sebaceous cyst between the anterior right sixth and seventh ribs.  ____________________ Impression:    1.

I was traveling and attributed my face to mask wearing. I started itching in the car on the way home.   This was my booster shot. Back in June after I had had the 2 Pfizer shots I had an increase in blood pressure even though medicated that finally was gotten under control thru medicine. It happened in June and I got my first two shots in February and March.  It was VERY high.  So I was too scared while traveling to take my blood pressure but when I got back in town I took it and it had jumped again after the booster.  I'm going to give it a few months to see if it goes back down.  But since i've been home, in the two weeks after the shot, I have now broken out in little red bumps mostly on my stomach. back, a few on my legs, and breasts.  Not on my arms or lower legs.  It looked like measles at first.  I react to things medication wise and have some chronic health issues, and am on six prescriptions just for those, so I am concerned.  I'm not going to the dr. because I go to the clinic and they said they don't have anything to do with the covid shots.  I got my first two at medical center, but the actual drs office said they aren't involved in the covid shots.  So I'm waiting to see if the hives go away but thought somebody should know about the reaction.  I'm concerned if something is internally wrong to cause it.  And my legs just feel like they are dragging.  They aren't going away... they are just there.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of intracranial pressure increased, headache, dizziness, vertigo, feeling abnormal. Clinical Course: The patient received the first dose on 27Sept2021 and within about 5 minutes, she felt lightheaded and dizzy spell. She felt like it rushed to her brain and dispersed. It felt like the liquid was just sitting there and it hasn't gone away. The rush to her head sat there giving her extreme pressure in the brain/cranial area along with an explosive headache. She had a pounding headache ever since the first dose and it has not subsided. She drank water and took Tylenol and she had to take the next day off. She ""felt off"" the whole week. The spinning comes and goes but the headache doesn't go away. She took Tylenol for 2 or 3 days but the Tylenol was not working for her headache. It's like if the liquid was just sitting in her brain and it does not go away. She just doesn't know what's happening in her head. She had persistent headache, migraine and pressure in the brain. She went to urgent care but they could do nothing so they referred her to the emergency room. Then she went home hoping it would pass but it did not. She was still experiencing pressure and headache. She received the second vaccine on 18Oct2021. The second shot had a moment of lightheadedness but she did not feel the rush to her head as she did with the first shot. The pressure and extreme headache she experienced since the first dose had never recovered. She went to the emergency room on 20Oct2021 where a CAT scan was done and found nothing. They prescribed a headache medication Benzonatate which does nothing. She took Aleve which elevated the pressure mildly for two seconds on 29Nov2021.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 07Dec2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid. This is a literature report.  The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of vaccine timing, immunological status, demographics, and concomitant treatments on vaccine immunogenicity in autoimmune rheumatic disease (AIRD) patients treated with RTX (rituximab). Secondary aims were to implement an educational intervention to physicians and patients and assess its effect on timing of COVID-19 vaccination in relation to RTX infusions. Authors performed a prospective single center study to optimize SARSCoV-2 vaccination timing and to assess vaccine immunogenicity in AIRD patients who received RTX at a health care hospital. Authors first educated faculty on the rationale for timing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 24 weeks post-RTX. Authors measured timing of vaccine administration through telephone survey of patients. Authors then analyzed vaccine immunogenicity in relation to vaccine timing and other clinical and immunologic parameters. Patients were contacted by telephone from March through August of 2021. Study participants were surveyed on recent vaccine administration, and in those who had not yet received a vaccination, whether or not they were intending to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine.

The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: blood test: (2021) unknown results, notes: blood levels and platelet levels. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash, headache. Clinical course was as follows: The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose on 29Nov2021 and was complaining of ""breaking out"" of rashes all over both of her hands, shortness of breath, very blurry vision, chest palpitations, a chronic cough that she cannot stop, a headache every morning in which no over the counter medications work for, chills, hot flashes, and 3 bluish purple bruises that appeared out of nowhere on her legs. She was asking if these side effects have been reported especially the bruising or blood clotting because she mentioned that she has a heart issue. The patient was told that her signs might be indicative of an allergic reaction. She was referred to the healthcare professional (HCP) for confirmation and mentioned that if it is considered a severe allergic reaction, then it would not be recommended for her to take a 2nd dose. The rash broke out all over hands, both of them, after she got the vaccine on 29Nov2021 and clarified that she first experienced the rash about 2 hours later, after the vaccine. She was still experiencing the rash now but, stated that it was healing up. She still has pockets all over her hands and had to get medication for it and clarified that she used a topical cream called Triamcinolone. Blurry vision started the same day, that she got the vaccine, 29Nov2021. It has gotten worse, and it was also hard to breathe. The shortness of breath started 2 days later after the vaccine on 01Dec2021 and has gotten a little worse. Her chest palpitations/heart palpitations which started on 01Dec2021 have gotten worse. She also had chronic cough that she cannot stop since Nov2021. The headache every morning started the day after the vaccine on 30Nov2021. She has been taking medications (Aleve and Ibuprofen) every day and it's fine but then after that, it still hurts. The headaches have gotten worse, and it was a sharp pain going through the head. She stated that the pain in the head is also in the ears and clarified that the ear pain started the day after the headache on 01Dec2021. Chills and hot flashes both started the same day, 29Nov2021 and she is still experiencing them now. She noticed 3 bluish purple bruises that appeared out of nowhere on her legs on 05Dec2021.

The event ""the caller's psa had gone from 5.77 to 17 which is almost a three fold increase which means he should be dead because its so large"" was evaluated at the physician office visit. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: prostatic specific antigen (PSA test): (2001) 1-2, notes: when the patient was 60 years old; (2011) between 0 and 1, notes: 10 years ago; (2020) 5.77; (2021) 17, notes: three fold increase; (2021) 15; (2021) 14.9. Additional information: It was reported that in the past, the patient had his prostate specific agent tested and shows a very small progression (10 years ago, the patient's PSA was between 0 and 1). The patient read in the literature that the PSA goes up as the person gets older. When the patient was 60 years old in 2001, PSA was 1-2. Last year, on 2020, PSA was 5.77. The patient thought that it was because of his age and his doctor didn't see anything wrong about it. A month after the vaccination, the patient underwent PSA test. The patient's PSA had gone from 5.11 to 17, which was almost a three-fold increase which means that the patient should be dead because it was so high. The patient went to his MD (medical doctor). The patient's doctors are a bunch of union workers that agree on everything about the vaccine, so he wasn't skeptical and didn't pull his blood before he got the vaccine. The caller won't know what his PSA was before the vaccine. Pfizer didn't warn people that this could happen, but the patient thinks that this does have something to do with it because the vaccine puts out proteins. The surface protein well that's what the vaccine does. The patient thought his MD would know and he isn't even thinking. The patient's doctors are not seeing if there are any effects of the vaccine on tests like the PSA. Now, the patient has to go back to this doctor and has to do something with this large number. The patient had his PSA re-tested on 2021 and it was 15. The patient doesn't think anyone was researching about this. The FDA didn't say anything about the PSA and the CDC didn't even comment about this critical vaccine. The patient afraid that he has cancer because it was so high. The caller was at the mercy of urologists and will take a biopsy and this created an ambivalence of the sick or not sick. The patient had a PSA test on 2021, 4 months after the vaccine, and the result was 14.9. The patient does not remember the exact dates his PSA was checked.

Then she went to bed at 10 PM and that was usually early for her; she was so tired that it was unbelievable. The minute she laid down it triggered everything. It was weird, she thought maybe it was because she was lying down and all the blood went to her head or something, but it began the minute that she had laid down. It was like instant pain as she had the worst headache/terrible headache and her head was throbbing, and no amount of aspirin or cold compress or ice relieved the pain; it was really awful that she thought she was going to die. She also thought that she was going to throw up the entire time, she had chills, she was miserable, and she has never been so sick. She didn't go to work that next day, she was just in bed. Her headache finally disappeared after 24 hours which made a huge difference for her because she felt like she couldn't function. Then on the third morning she tried going to work but didn't feel great. On her way to work she almost threw up/she felt like she was going to throw up and she was nauseous. Her work told her to go back home so she went back home. She didn't go to work for 3 days. Then everything was gone the ""next day"". All together the worst of it was for 38 to 40 hours. She got over that and thought she was one of the unlucky ones. She thought maybe that she had an allergic reaction. She was not allergic to anything that she knows of and she doesn't know what she would be allergic to. She had no difficulty breathing, her face and throat didn't swell, she forgot about having any side effects with her heart, she had no rash, she did feel weak, she had no chest pain, and she had no shortness of breath. She had the terrible arm pain for days. She had a violent headache and that was the worst one she has ever had. She had a fever, and she thought that her headache was from the fever. She had issues with her muscles in her body. Her joints were swollen and achy, wrist and knee joints had swollen up, and she just had everything. She didn't vomit but she kept on feeling like she was going to vomit. She was awake for about 24 hours because she couldn't sleep. She wants to have the booster so that she won't get Covid, but she wanted to know if it was going to kill her. All the side effects lasted for a few days before they went away.

He said he could not state that it cause her mild allergy but he also said that he couldn't rule it out either since it was within less than a week since she took it. He said it was a mild reaction. He gave her benadryl and prelone. I asked if I should proceed with the second dose. He said I should and suggested that I follow up with our primary care doctor. I followed up with Dr. on Tuesday December 7, 2021. The rashes did not return and Dr. also advised that we continue with the second dose and that I report the incident. I reported it on the vaccine checkin via text message and received a call from the cdc (who suggested that I make a formal report online).",,,,,,,,,Y,11/30/2021,12/04/2021,4,no,PUB,,Flintstones Complete and Smarty Pants Kids formula multivitamin,none,none,,,2,12/21/2021,,,,none to our knowledge

He was able to report back to me the role of a DPOA, and I feel he is currently capable of appointing one. I was able to reach his friend, and she tells me she is the  Trustee of his step-father's trust (pays patient's bills). Friend tells me she has told patient that he needs to find someone to be his medical POA as she cannot because it would be conflict of interest. She tells me patient went to college but never held a job. She describes him as socially awkward. He has a group of friends that he plays Dungeons and Dragons and involved in church.

We assessed our records and confirmed that this was the case. We reviewed CDC recommendations for an event of this nature and noticed that the recommendation is for the patient to receive their second as the 5y/o to 11y/o formulation at the regular 21-day interval. Per IR records, the patient received their second dose as the 5y/o to 11y/o formulation on 12/10/2021 at a different facility.

Patient fully vaccinated including booster.  COVID testing however in the emergency department was positive.  Chest x-rays done in the emergency department on 12/12/2021 which showed minor atelectasis or opacity of the left lung base.  All other infectious workup remained negative during this admission.  Patient was started on Rocephin and azithromycin in the emergency room empirically however after negative further infectious workup in no further fevers, it was determined that antibiotics were no longer indicated.  Patient was given monoclonal antibody in the emergency department however despite requiring no supplemental oxygen, patient was admitted for further evaluation and treatment of patient's shortness of breath because after receiving monoclonal antibody, patient subsequently became severely hypertensive, short of breath and had wheezing.  Following this reaction, patient was given albuterol, dexamethasone and Benadryl for possible reaction.  Chest x-ray was repeated at that time to ensure no pulmonary edema and this was negative and stable compared to previous chest x-ray.  Patient was given remdesivir and dexamethasone in emergency department and throughout the duration of this admission (two doses of remdesivir given).  Patient continued to remain on room air and having completely recovered from suspected reaction, it was determined clinically stable to discharge home off antibiotics or steroids per my discussion with Dr.  Patient continued to eat, drink, void and ambulate on his own during this admission as per home baseline.  Patient eager to discharge home today though did have significant concerns about infecting his wife.  We did discuss safety measures and quarantine recommendations at great length.  Patient is aware that he may not present back to our office until 10 days of quarantine has elapsed but should call with questions/concerns.  We are pushing his chemotherapy out until 12/22/21. During this admission, patient was evaluated by the physical therapy team and felt that patient was stable to return home with outpatient services.  Physical therapy was consulted for outpatient care upon discharge.

I've had several flu vaccines throughout the years, and other than a bit of tenderness at the injection site, I've never had an issue whatsoever.  This time I did.  The person administering the vaccination gave me the injection, and although the injection itself was painful, I didn't think anything of it.  The employee told me to remain for 15 minutes in case of a reaction of some sort.  I agreed but told her I had some shopping to do that would take at least that long.  Before leaving the store, I did notice my arm was in pain, but recalled other friends have told me their flu shots were painful, and in some cases lasted a week or so.  My arm has remained in pain since that day.  I am an avid workout individual, and every active person.  My left arm is limited in performing everyday functions, such as attaching my seatbelt, carrying my 2 year old granddaughter, putting on clothes, working out, and reaching to some length.  the pain even affects my sleeping.  Since October 6th, I have not had a complete night of sleep.  I did finally perform an internet search and found that my shot could have been given with a larger needle than my small frame can handle.  Another article mentioned a flu vaccine could cause a type of pre-arthritis.  Anyway, I did finally see a doctor today (pt's letter was dated 11-29-21 and received by pharmacy 12/20/21) and she is treating me with a drug for possible inflammation and muscle relaxer to help me sleep.  I know I possibly should have notified you earlier, but I continue to believe the pain would eventually subside, and I'm certainly hoping it does now that I have medication.  I'm notifying you at the request of my doctor.  She believes, if it's possible the pain is directly from the vaccination, then it's vital that I notify you, so that this does not happen again.  I know I will certain be asking more questions about needle size etc before getting another vaccine of any sort.",,,,,,,,,N,10/06/2021,10/06/2021,0,,PHM,,UNKNOWN,UNKOWN,UNKNOWN,,,2,12/21/2021,,Y,,MORPHINE AND MINOCYCLINE

As baseline, spouse reported patient to be conversant.  In the ED patient noted to be mildly tachycardic with tachypnea. Initial lab work demonstrated an AKI. Stroke code was initiated with CT head, CTA head/neck and CT perfusion scan unremarkable. Neurology was contacted by ED and recommended admission to the medicine service for MRI. # Toxic/Metabolic Encephalopathy  # Early Onset Dementia In Setting of MS MRI brain w/ and w/o contrast (11/24) without acute findings, and notable for global atrophy and sequelae of chronic MS. 2 hour EEG (11/24) without epileptiform activity. UA without evidence of infection and VBG without Co2 retention. Neurology signed off given lack of stroke and/or seizure findings. Etiology felt secondary to progression of dementia and/or COVID-19 PNA. On 11/30 stroke code was called overnight due to increase in expressive aphasia and generalized weakness, head CT without bleed and neurology re-evaluated patient and felt no neurological deficits and therefore signed off.  # Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with Acute LLE DVT Left lower extremity venous US (11/25) with extensive VTE extending to the common femoral vein. CTA thorax (11/25) with bilateral PE with at least moderate clot burden and no evidence of heart strain. Echo obtained and confirmed lack of heart strain. Etiology felt secondary to COVID-19 and initially given dose of Apixaban in the ED, with heparin gtt while hospitalized. IR was consulted and felt no intervention needed for PE. CT abd/pelvis (11/25) was obtained to determine extent of LLE DVT which showed IVC to be patent and no evidence of extension superior to left inguinal region and therefore IR recommended no intervention regarding DVT. However, IR placed an IVC filter.  # Right Iliopsoas Retroperitoneal Hematoma Patient was noted to have down trending Hgb and therefore GI was consulted with recommendation for CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast due to AKI. Imaging revealed retroperitoneal hematoma for which IR was consulted. As hemoglobin remained stable, recommending monitoring closely while on heparin gtt.  He was subsequently switched to Eliquis which he tolerated well.  CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast was repeated on 11/30 with stable hematoma, the hemoglobin was monitored and remained stable.. COVID-19 PNA with Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Insufficiency Patient was initially diagnosed with PCR (11/15) and fully vaccinated x2 with Moderna (albeit >6 months ago). CTA thorax demonstrated mild-moderate GGO. Strep pneumonia and legionella testing was negative. Complete 1.5 gm of Azithromycin for atypical coverage and 5 days of IV Rocephin for typical coverage while hospitalized. He was also treated with Decadron during hospitalization.

She told me that because I had experienced some of these feelings before that I was probably okay.

Before the vaccine the wet spot feeling would be infrequent, happening every great once in a while. Maybe once a week or less.

Patient has a history of multiple sclerosis with bilateral lower extremity weakness and has a known cognitive decline.  Patient resides at a nursing facility.  She tested positive for COVID-19 pneumonia few days ago.  Patient was reportedly not taking her medications at the facility and was nauseated.  She developed altered mental status and fever which prompted her to be evaluated at the emergency department.  As per chart review patient with known cognitive decline however is oriented x4 at baseline. On admission CT head was done which was negative.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral pneumonia.  Labs showed hyponatremia with sodium 150. Patient's UA was positive for urinary tract infection.  Rocephin, azithromycin And vancomycin likely for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection.  Will continue with IV Rocephin for urinary tract infection at this time.  Patient currently on room air.  Received 1 dose of dexamethasone 6 mg IV for COVID-19 pneumonia treatment.

So, I got up on Tuesday, I felt at my worst so I couldn't go to work. I worked from home, and I just had really bad congestion and cough. Cough was worse than what it originally was. Called the doctor and asked maybe they need to do a chest x-ray. The x-ray was clear, and it was within normal limits. I stayed home on Wednesday and went to work Thursday, still had the congestion and cough even with the medication. Every day I went to Starbucks to get a medicine ball to help with the symptoms, but cough is still consistent every hour. Even with taking the medication.

I had not recently tried any new foods or new medications. I sought help for the hives and was prescribed prednisone and loratidine, and I took Benadryl as well because the hives would only improve with Benadryl. I later returned to the doctor as I was experiencing side effects from the medications and my hives were not improving. The most concerning symptom that caused me to return to the doctor was a symmetric sharp pain in my hands that was otherwise unexplained and caused me to have difficulty doing my regular daily activities that required my hands. I was then also prescribed Pepsid and the prednisone was decreased. As of Dec 21 2021, I am still experiencing hives, although they are much less itchy than before.
