The rash or hives continued up my  neck up to my face and that all happened within first five minutes. Immediately after that, I had excessive coughing - couldn't cough up anything. I couldn't catch my breath and my throat started swelling a bit. they gave me 25 mg of Benadryl - capsule over the counter - and the 9-1-1 operator advised not to use the epi- pen. Paramedics came - gave me addition 50 mg of Benadryl - and they took me to the ER across the street and I was administered another 25 mg of Benadryl and also some steroid - Solumedrol - and after receiving these - then these symptoms went away. I continued on Benadryl and prednisone for a few weeks - the very next week - I had a large streak that went from injection site to left chest and I had a second red streak from left chest that ran down to my left arm. For two weeks, that burning fire rash would just come. No rhyme or reason as to when or why - arm, neck, chest, legs and sides.

And about 24 hours after the vaccine- extreme fatigue, body aches and headache and weakness and that lasted for about three days. Fatigue lasted three to four weeks. Joint aches lasted three to four aches. Headaches have still continued. They have almost been worse actually. I had two headaches that I was so concerned about that would not go away - worst headaches I have ever had: one on May 1 and one on May 9 - and I took Maxalt and some Benadryl - the Benadryl did help a little bit (enough for me to go to sleep). Each headache lasted 12 -15 hours and they were the most severe headaches I had ever had. I didn't have anyone to take me to take me to hospital so I just tried to sleep.

While he was being monitored for any adverse reactions, Pt. asked if lightheadedness was a side effect of the shot.  Writer advised that it could be and that everyone is different.  Writer asked if he would like some water, and he declined. Pt. was advised to remove his mask so he could breathe better.  Writer took his pulse while I gathered information.  It was 96.  Pt. reported that he did eat lunch, is drinking plenty of water and fluids.  He relayed he is keeping food down and not having any other issues. Pt. is currently on opiate withdrawal protocol.  Writer asked about his breathing and his chest.  Pt. relayed he was not having difficulty breathing and denied any chest pain at all.  Writer spoke with the Deputy to be sure that we kept an eye on him for a bit longer after his 15 minutes while he was in his cell, due to his lightheadedness.  Pt. was talking with writer, answering questions with ease.  Pt. was not diaphoretic and did have good color.  His pulse was checked again, and it was 84. At 1333, when his 15-minute observation was done, writer went to assist pt. to his feet and informed him that I would escort him back to his cell because he was still feeling a bit uneasy.  When he stood, pt.'s knees buckled, and he knelt to the ground.  Writer helped pt. to lay down.  It was a smooth transition, and he had no injuries to his head or body.  Pt. had what appeared to be a short spell where his body completely tensed for a few seconds, then he relaxed.  He was having a hard time keeping his eyes open, but when prompted, was able to open his eyes.  The Deputy standing by was asked to call for the Public Health Nurses, who had moved on to the next POD to continue vaccinating.  Once on the scene, pt.'s blood pressure was obtained.  142/80.  His pulse was 82.  During this time, it appeared that the tensing episodes became more frequent and a bit more severe.  They were happening approximately every 30 seconds, and lasting between 5 and 10 seconds.  EMS was activated at approximately 1340.  Pt. was awake during these episodes, and communicated with the nurses attending to him. While attending to pt. and waiting for EMS, it was at that time that pt. admitted that this was not the first time this had happened.  He admitted that about a week ago, the same thing happened.  When that new information was explored, pt. reported that his wife thought he had ""Serotonin Syndrome"".  Writer asked what meds he was taking on the outside and he reported that he only takes methadone form the clinic.  He denied any other medications or street drug usage.  He does not take any mental health medications at our facility. Collectively, the nurses that attended to him after this episode agreed that this is an isolated incident and not related to receiving the COVID vaccine.  EMS arrived at approximately 1347, and report was given.  He was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Pt. was returned from the hospital at approximately 1600.  The Officer that accompanied him reported to facility that the hospital also believed this was an isolated incident, most likely related to withdrawals.  They did not believe that receiving the vaccine was a factor in today's events.  Labs were drawn at the hospital, and were all WNL.   Once back in custody, writer spoke briefly with pt..

IMPRESSION Mild coronary artery disease Mild LAD myocardial bridge with dynamic compression of LAD Normal TIMI 3 flow in all vessels  RECOMMENDATIONS Serial EKG, trop, echo, CRP, ESR, lipids, A1c Consider outpatient stress echo Continue Aspirin 81mg PO qday indefinitely unless contraindicated Plan and findings were communicated with primary team  Coronary Findings Dominance: Right Left Anterior Descending  Dist LAD lesion, 20% stenosed  Right Coronary Artery   Prox RCA lesion, 10% stenosed   Current biomarkers https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cardiac-biomarkers Troponin ? most common test CRP ~ C-reactive protein test ESR ~ erythrocyte sedimentation rate (type of blood test) A1c ~ common blood test used to diagnose type 1 + 2 diabetes  4/6/21 ECHO Complete (40 ? 42)  CONCLUSIONS  Summary 1. The left ventricle is normal in structure with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and normal function => thickening of the wall of the heart?s main pumping chamber; the most common cause is high blood pressure.  2. The IVC is minority dilated with greater than 50% respiratory change in the dimension.   Left ventricle Normal left ventricular systolic function The ejection fraction is estimated at 60% (??) E/A flow reversal noted. Suggestive of diastolic dysfunction. There is mild left ventricular hypertrophy.",OTH,,None,None,None,,,2,05/12/2021,Y,,,None

1311681,05/12/2021,PA,57.0,57,,F,,"Starting Sunday, May 2nd around 5pm, I noticed a pain in my back near my right shoulder blade.  It started small ? just when I would stretch my right arm out, but as the time went by, it began to hurt from that starting spot going up my back into my neck, into my right arm, around the right side of my chest and down the right side front of my chest.  I took 2 ibuprofen which seemed to do nothing.  When I went to bed around 10pm, it became hard to move without pain, so I took 4 ibuprofen and a OTC sleeping pill.  I slept very restlessly, as any movement caused a lot of pain.                                                                                                  ?On Monday upon waking, I could not get out of bed without pain.  There was so much pain any way I would move, and found to get out of bed, I had to get onto my stomach, and slide out of bed like a snake.  Again, I took 4 ibuprofen hoping to have some relief, but it really didn?t do much.  Any movement that would make the muscles on my right side move, would cause a great deal of pain.  Just to lift my right arm, I had to do so using my left hand to lift my right arm.  Any movement at all was painful.  This continued all day.  I tried also switching ibuprofen to extra strength acetaminophen which did not help.  By the time I went to bed I could barely move.  Again, I went to bed with 4 ibuprofen and an OTC sleep aid.  Another restless painful night of sleep was the result.    ?Tuesday upon waking I felt better until I tried to get out of bed.  The pain was back and I found that I again I had to slither out of the bed on my stomach.  This time I took Excedrin Migraine as I found a migraine headache looming.  Taking this was the first true relief of pain.  Although I had twinges of discomfort, I didn?t have the extreme pain when I moved.  I was relatively good for the rest of Tuesday and Tuesday night.  As I felt I had some improvement in pain relief, I did not take any OTC meds.    ?This morning when I woke, I again found I could not sit up, push myself up or anything other than gingerly rolling onto my belly and sliding out of bed again.  I took a hot shower, letting the water beat down on my back, which seemed to help some and followed it up with 4 ibuprofen.  Currently I?m doing better, I can move without a lot of pain, but I do get the occasional jab of pain in my neck/shoulders/right arm/back (just beneath the right shoulder blade).     I know this sounds like an odd reaction, however I did not do anything that would have caused this issue with my muscles.  On Sunday I tossed a frisbee to my 6 year old grandson for about 10 minutes, and planted one planter with flowers.  I cannot think of anything different in my life other than this vaccine.  No new exercise, no new meds, no new anything.  Over a week prior to this vaccination, I was lugging large bags of mulch and potting soil with no issues whatsoever, so I find it hard to imagine that tossing a frisbee could cause this kind of pain.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/28/2021,05/02/2021,4,unknown,WRK,,unknown,unknown,unknown,,,2,05/12/2021,,,,no known drug allergies

Cardiomegaly: None. END OF IMPRESSION: INDICATION: Covid 19 positive, shortness of breath, concern for pulmonary arterial embolism. Assess for pulmonary artery embolism. TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scan chest is performed per pulmonary embolism protocol, after IV contrast administration, using 2.0 mm intervals reconstructed in axial plane. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images are also obtained. Post processing 3-dimensional volume rendered views are created at an independent workstation, under concurrent supervision, and subsequently sent to the PACS system. CONTRAST: 80mL of IOHEXOL 350 MG IODINE/ML INTRAVENOUS SOLUTION administered INTRAVENOUS. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from earlier today. Chest CT from December 8, 2020 FINDINGS: On soft tissue windows, there is adequate contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial system. Mean Hounsfield units over the main pulmonary artery measure 368. This is best seen on axial series 402, image 56. There is no convincing evidence of an intraluminal filling defect. There is no pulmonary arterial embolism demonstrated. There is no thoracic aortic aneurysm. There is no thoracic aortic dissection. There is no mediastinal hemorrhage. Moderate ASCVD. Calcified plaque involving the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. Post processing 3-dimensional volume rendered views best demonstrates the degree of calcified plaque. There is no axillary, internal mammary, mediastinal, hilar adenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion. There is no pleural effusion. Limited images to the upper abdomen demonstrates no suspicious abnormalities. On lung windows, there are groundglass parenchymal opacities most pronounced peripherally. This involves approximately 50% of the underlying lung parenchyma. This is consistent with diffuse bilateral Covid 19 pneumonia. Central airways are patent. There are no endobronchial lesions. On bone windows, scoliosis and degenerative change. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesion. This report was created using Voice Recognition software.

She was admitted to emergency room and was given epinephrine and prednisone and things started to get better. The next day symptoms returned, and patient went to urgent care the next morning. There the patient received another prescription for prednisone for 5 days. After that finished her symptoms returned and was given another round of prednisone for 6 days. The patient was still having slight symptoms that she was treating with fexofenadine (ALLEGRA) twice per day per advice of allergist. The patient was met with an allergist and was slightly concerned and thought it was unusual that this would continue past symptoms of 2 weeks. It was reported that the patient was experiencing slight symptoms, nothing crazy, but was wondering what communication from Pfizer was if someone did have an allergic reaction that most people were treated in emergency room. On an unknown date, the patient had allergy tests and no information found on allergy tests. It was reported that the patient antibody testing was not currently recommended to assess for immunity. The patient was discharged with instructions to get an epi pen in case anything got crazy, and her husband drove her home. It was stated as soon as it was her turn the system disconnected. The patient stated the only reason she waited after 4 hours was because she was 5th in line, and it took 2 hours 50 minutes to get to be her turn.

Among the Vaccine recipients, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site within 7 days after an injection was the most reported local reaction, with less than 1% of participants. In general, local side effects; the ones you get on the arm where you got the shot (such as injection site redness and injection site swelling) were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days. Side effects that you may experience throughout the rest of your body; (systemic side effects) including fever and chills were observed with the first 1 to 2 days after vaccination and resolved shortly thereafter. Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), which generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited immune response.

They said there was a chance of anaphylaxis reaction to the second shot. The patient reported blacking out, diarrhea, sweating and unable to talk. She consulted with her healthcare professional regarding whether to get the second shot and they didn't know. She asked if her reactions were normal. She doesn't know what to do whether to get a second shot given her reaction. It was mentioned that the patient was hard to hear at times.

She woke up in horrible pain from head to toe, she thought maybe she just needed to pee, she didn't know what was going on. She stood up and she blacked out like she was about to faint. She couldn't see anything, like it was completely black. She got to bathroom and she couldn't breathe at all, she couldn't talk. She thought she needs to go to the hospital, but she couldn't talk. Her face turned green, she had diarrhea, she was like dripping wet. At this point, she could sort of breathe. She felt like she was being held under water, still dripping sweat. She has recovered completely from these symptoms. The severity of symptoms was so severe she doesn't know if she had a fever at the same time, it was hard to tell. With the breathing part, she was so freaked out by that, so it's hard to know for sure, maybe yes. She may have had a low fever.

Patient has some 5 or 6 doctors there as specialists or prescribers. She has a liver specialist and a vasculitis specialist, whom she has not seen since the flare up because of her insurance, a main primary that saved her and brought her into remission is not covered with her insurance, and a GI doctor as well. She also reported that her immune system is probably weaker than her mom's because of her own 2 diseases. She also said that she was supposed to be in lung therapy but her body is weak. She stated that every time something hurts, it may be neuropathy. She has weak muscles and they haven't been this weak. She could move around and do things before. Patient was tired from the autoimmune and lung disease, she has had to stop and rest. Patient clarified that she had these prior to COVID coming. Patient wanted to get the vaccine to have more immunity so she could go out.  She didn't want to get the Corona virus. The doctors said she wouldn't make it. It was her choice but the doctors recommended it.  It was reported that patient has completed vaccination. About a week ago (13Apr2021), started experiencing a lot of pain from a vasculitis flare up.  It is as if it just happened and was having a lot of pain in various parts of the body. Patient stated that it didn't start until like the second day (13Apr2021). Patient was not disgruntled, believes in the vaccine. She has an appointment with the tele doc this week and with another doctor at the same office since doctor was not in this week, because of her back and her having an injury from 2 years ago, X-rays, and can't walk right now, is in a lot of pain. She did not know if she can take pain pills, with all her other stuff. Patient stated that both her legs hurt and she can't walk. Her hands were also hurting with it in Apr2021. Patient had knee pain on 19Apr2021, leg pain was still there but getting better and was still hurting when she walks. It is not as hard of a pain but it is in the muscles below the knee and in the back of the calf in Apr2021. On 21Apr2021 or 22Apr2021, right and left arm just hurts all the way down started. They are the same and are still hurting and staying persistent. On 26Apr2021, back pain was added and stated that she got it for complaining about her arm. It started About 3 days after the shot, around 14Apr2021 or 15Apr2021, patient had whiplash in shoulders and the neck. It started in the back of the head and was like she could feel radiation or heat. It would be so uncomfortable, her shoulders became sore. When she looked left or right, it felt like whip lash. It has gotten better. For her arm, she wanted to revert to ice/heat but she hasn't done anything yet. Patient called her primary in hopes that he would give her something for the pain, she was not in pain management but it is hurting so bad. Since the injection, she has been so tired, so she has not been taking her XANAX. She takes them as needed for generalized anxiety disorder and her anxiety has not been up. A lot of the time she does not have to take them. The diseases make her tired and fatigued. If her mind is too racy, she will take to keep as calm as possible, especially with the small cell vasculitis or then she could have a flare. Her main objective is to keep calm. She was already taking 1 XANAX a day when diagnosed with PTSD but they just raised it because then came her PTSD and depression from the vasculitis. Has muscle relaxer cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (FLEXERIL) at 100mg once a day which she doesn't take. Did not normally take these but has been taking them since this happened. She is in so much pain. Does not generally have high tolerance for pain. Does not like taking opioids because they make her throw up. She can only take them with Phenergan. Does not take if she does not need them because they do not sit well with the liver. She has an inhaler that keeps the lungs dilated for 10 hours, is not Pulmicort but something else. Eyes hurt on Apr2021 and can't read the label because its so little. She has bronchiolitis which is another rare disease with the airways in her lung and medication keeps the lungs dilated. Haven't seen the doctor yet so no tests yet. Since this happened, she can't walk. On 26Apr2021, when she went back down she couldn't walk since. It is her lower back on the right side, above her hip. She had pulled it 2 years ago (2019), above the hip on the right side. She recognized this feeling from a couple of years ago. It seems to be the place where she feels over winded. It may be neuropathy problems, wondering if it's not neuropathy since it's not her muscles (Apr2021). Everything that was wounded has come back and hurts as bad as it does. For can't walk, the pain just hurts. She didn't sleep at all last night (26Apr2021). Tries to turn and get up and if she is on either of her arms. Other than the neck, shoulders and back of her head, she never got a fever. When it started she thought that it was normal. Then, it started hitting in all of these other places and she was barely moving. Patient had the normal feeling like when she would breathe. On an unspecified date, she was having stiffness of the joints, as if they were traveling, then taking a vacation to every place that she has ever hurt itself. She had fell on both arms, she's had a knee surgery and its like going to that. The knee surgery was on the right knee. Like right now its in her back, and she can barely walk because she pulled a back muscle before. She stated that she will enjoy it if she can walk again and she just wanted to make it through this. The adverse events did not require emergency room visit or physician's office visit but was definitely at the point where she will go see the primary or go to the ER.

She states that she had back surgery about 10 years ago at Beaumont.  She states she was supposed to see her neurosurgeon last year but this did not occur secondary to COVID-19.  Her primary care physician had referred her to a neurologist did some injections ahead some relief of her back pain for a week or 2 but this is since worsened.  She states that over last several days she has had increasing numbness and tingling in her feet as well as increasing weakness of her lower extremities as well as some now some new incontinence of urine when she stands up.

The patient was originally seen by Neurology on 05/07/2021 when she presented with diffuse weakness.  She has a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes.  The patient at that time described the acute onset of weakness ascending from the feet, then involving the legs and arms also associated with sensory symptoms that started about 2 weeks prior to her presentation.  She also had persistent neck and back pain radiating to her arm and legs limiting her ability to walk.  On neurologic examination at that time the patient had absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities and trace reflexes at the biceps.  She had significant weakness in the lower extremities and mild weakness in the upper extremities.  She also had a dysarthric speech.   Given the patient's CSF analysis showing protein elevation to 266 with no pleocytosis, wbc's were only for, there was support for a clinical diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating poly radicular neuropathy or such variant.    The patient was started on plasmapheresis and has received her 2nd session of plasmapheresis on 05/09/2021.  She will have a total of 5 sections, one every other day.  The patient also has hyponatremia, this can be seen in about 5% of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome, we also do see pseudohyponatremia but this is in patients that have received IVIG.",,,,,Y,9,,,N,04/09/2021,04/27/2021,18,"5/7/21 Cerebrospinal fluid analysis: Protein 266, Glucose 97, WBC 4, RBC 3, Appearance Clear, Colorless  5/2/21 MRI lumbar spine w/o contrast: TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed.   COMPARISON: None.   FINDINGS: Degenerative and postoperative changes are present in the lumbar spine.  There has been previous surgery at L4-5.  Bilateral pedicle screws are present.  In degenerative changes are most prominent at the L3-4 level.  There is moderate disc space narrowing with endplate changes and erosions. There is no fracture or subluxation.   L1-2 and L2-3 have annular bulging with only minimal effacement of the thecal sac.  Facets are within normal limits.  Foramina remain patent. L3-4 has mild endplate hypertrophy and associated disc bulging with mild effacement of the thecal sac.  There mild hypertrophic changes of facets.  Moderate to marked foraminal narrowing is present bilaterally greater on the right. L4-5 has had a decompressive laminectomy.  There is minimal endplate prominence.  There is no spinal stenosis.  There is moderate right foraminal narrowing and minimal left foraminal narrowing. L5-S1 has mild endplate prominence and associated annular bulging without disc herniation or spinal stenosis.  Mild hypertrophy of the facets is present.  There is minimal foraminal narrowing on the right. Signal in the conus is normal.   IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes at L4-5.  Degenerative changes predominantly at L3-4.  There is moderate-to-marked foraminal narrowing greater on the right at this level.  5/8/21 MRI head w/o contrast: FINDINGS: Diffusion-weighted images do not demonstrate any abnormal signal to suggest recent infarct. Sagittal T1 images demonstrate normal appearance of corpus callosum, normal size of the pituitary, and normal position of the cerebellar tonsils.  Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits in terms of size.  There is mild burden of FLAIR hyperintense lesions within the periventricular and deep bihemispheric white matter as well as within the central pons.  Usual major arterial flow voids are present.  No significant abnormal fluid signal within the temporal bone structures or paranasal sinuses.  Gradient echo sequence is unremarkable.   IMPRESSION: 1.  No acute intracranial process is identified.  No evidence of recent hemorrhage or infarct. 2.  No space-occupying lesion is appreciated. 3.  Normal brain volume.  Mild burden of scattered white matter disease within the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and central pons; this is most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change.  5/8/21 MRI Spine cervical w/o contrast: TECHNIQUE: Multisequence, multiplanar, MR images were obtained of the cervical spine without the use of intravenous contrast.   FINDINGS: There is no suspicious focal marrow signal abnormality.  There are Modic type 2 changes within the marrow adjacent to the C5-C6 disc space and mixed Modic type 1 and type 2 changes within the marrow adjacent to the C6-C7 disc space.  The craniovertebral junction is intact.  There is no spondylolisthesis.  Vertebral body heights are intact.  There is diffuse disc desiccation.  There is significant disc space height loss at C5-C6 and C6-C7.  The cervical cord has normal caliber, contour, and signal throughout.  No gross abnormality of the exiting nerve roots.   C2-C3: No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.   C3-C4: Mild central disc protrusion without cord compression..  Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet/uncovertebral joint degenerative changes.   C4-C5: Mild broad-based disc bulge.  No significant central canal stenosis.  Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet/uncovertebral joint degenerative changes.   C5-C6: Mild broad-based disc osteophyte complex effaces the ventral CSF space but does not compress the cord.  There is moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to facet/uncovertebral joint degenerative changes.   C6-C7: Mild broad-based disc osteophyte complex.  No effect upon the cord.  Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.   C7-T1: No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis.   IMPRESSION: 1.  No acute fracture or malalignment. 2.  Diffuse spondylosis.  There is some mild central canal narrowing without any significant effect upon the cord.  Diffuse mild to moderate neural foraminal narrowing. 3.  Cervical cord has normal caliber, contour, and signal throughout.

He has not had any other vaccines within the last 2 weeks and has never had a COVID-19 vaccination.  He admits that they did hold pressure at the injection site since he is on a blood thinner and he has not appreciated any swelling at the injection site or bleeding. Later that evening at 7:30-8:00 pm he developed chills, rigors, arm swelling at the injection site and a oral temperature of 99.7.  He took Tylenol and went to bed with some improvement in his symptoms.  Since then his arm has become red, swollen extending downward from the injection site.  It did have some itch to it but now it has become more circumferential and painful causing him to seek evaluation.  His pain is aggravated by palpation and the symptoms were improved with Tylenol originally but continued to worsen now.  He is on Tikosyn and Eliquis so he is unsure of what he can take for his symptoms.  His symptoms are moderate in severity, rapidly worsening and persistent in nature. On physical exam he has 16 x 27 cm erythema and warmth with pain to palpation distally to the  injection site that is well appearing without hematoma, erythema or pain.

Shortly after receiving the shot, I had to use the restroom, so I asked if it was ok to do that before I sat for the 15 minutes. As I was walking to the bathroom, I felt a warm tingling sensation go through my arms (almost as if I could feel the injection going through my veins) and then the sensation traveled down my legs and my heart started RACING. This all happened within two to three minutes after receiving the shot. At first I just thought it was odd, but as I kept walking my heart rate continued to skyrocket and I did not like the way I felt. I went to the EMTs and they laid me down and hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. My blood pressure was significantly elevated (which is very unusual for me). As someone with neurocardiogenic syncope, my blood pressure typically drops - the way I felt was not at all in line with a syncopal episode.  My heart rate remained elevated while at rest, but did come down a little bit after about 20  minutes; my blood pressure would also  come down a bit while at rest but as I would lift my head (even just a little bit) to drink something my blood pressure and heart rate would again sky rocket. This went on for 1.5 hours. After about 2 hours, I was finally able to sit up without my blood pressure and heart rate going through the roof, but I felt simply awful. For the next two weeks I felt light headed (as if my head was detached from my body) and dizzy. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning without drinking a gatorade as I felt so weak and shaky. I developed significant heart palpitations that lasted for a solid month.  Additionally, I am someone who has always gotten a period at 27-28 days.

The patient received her second Covid 19 vaccination on March 11 but was experiencing some myalgias.  She had multiple sick contacts at home with COVID-19 infection.  Unfortunately she had diarrhea and poor p.o. intake and developed dehydration.  She came to the emergency department for further evaluation after she had her vital signs at home and saw her heart rate was elevated and her blood pressure was low.  She was found to have a sinus tachycardia with hypotension upon arrival despite the fact that she has been holding her blood pressure medications for several days.  She was hypokalemic.  Covid swab came back positive.  She was given IV fluids and potassium was replaced her blood pressure remained on the lower side.  She was admitted to the hospital and started on steroids.  She met criteria for remdesivir and convalescent plasma with saturation at 90% on room air on the second day of her admission.  She completed a 5-day course of remdesivir.  She was given a unit of convalescent plasma.  Her potassium normalized.  Her heart rate normalized.  She had a better oral intake.  Metoprolol tartrate was started on a lower dose for blood pressure and heart rate control.  Her blood pressure remained in the normal range off her lisinopril and Norvasc.  She does have history of Leiden 5 and with a history of DVT and takes Xarelto.  She had a D-dimer which was checked which was normal.  She continued on her Xarelto as an inpatient.  She has clinically improved and is now ready for discharge.  She is agreeable to remote patient monitoring and that has been arranged.  She should follow-up with her family doctor in 1 week.  Her lisinopril and Norvasc were discontinued at discharge.  I have recommended close follow-up with her family doctor to reintroduce these medications as needed pending on blood pressure trend.   _ Labs/Imaging   LABORATORY:   CBC:  Results from last 7 days Lab Units 03/22/21 0629 03/21/21 1224 03/20/21 1528 03/19/21 0550 WBC AUTO K/mcL 5.8 6.2 4.4 3.8* HEMOGLOBIN g/dL 13.8 13.4 12.7 12.2 HEMATOCRIT % 41.1 39.9 38.9 37.3 PLATELETS K/mcL 237 204 187 147 NEUTROS PCT AUTO % 63  --  81 75 LYMPHO PCT MAN %  --  17  --   --  LYMPHS PCT AUTO % 29  --  14 18 MONO PCT MAN %  --  2  --   --  MONOS PCT AUTO % 6  --  3 6 EOSINO PCT MAN %  --  0  --   --  EOS PCT AUTO % 0  --  0 0     CHEMISTRY:  Results from last 7 days Lab Units 03/22/21 0629 03/21/21 0642 03/20/21 1529 03/19/21 0550 SODIUM mmol/L 141 140 138 143 POTASSIUM mmol/L 3.8 3.9 3.6 3.6 CHLORIDE mmol/L 105 106 106 110* CO2 mmol/L 28 26 21 24 BUN mg/dL 18 18 16 8 CREATININE mg/dL 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.71 CALCIUM mg/dL 8.7 8.9 8.6 8.3* TOTAL PROTEIN gm/dL 7.1 7.2  --  7.1 BILIRUBIN TOTAL mg/dL 0.3 0.4  --  0.4 ALK PHOS IU/L 103 101  --  106* ALT IU/L 12 15 | 15 14 15 AST IU/L 15 17  --  22    Results from last 7 days Lab Units 03/20/21 1529 03/19/21 0550 03/18/21 0601 MAGNESIUM mg/dL 1.9 2.2 2.0     COAGULATION:      OTHER TESTS: No results found for: TROPONINI     IMAGING: X-ray Chest 1 View - Portable   Result Date: 3/17/2021 XR CHEST 1 VW PORT IMPRESSION: Limited patchy bibasilar airspace disease, right worse than left.

She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

Ejection Fraction 55% (normal range 50-70%).   All wall segments showed normal motion.        Mild concentric LVH.                           Trivial aortic regurgitation.                  No additional significant valvular abnormality. No prior study for comparison.                 Presentation and History: Indication: The patient presents for evaluation of arrhythmia.  The patient has a history of obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Findings: Procedure Information: Contrast agent, definity, is being given per protocol without apparent complications.  Due to technical limitations in the assessment of the left ventricle, imaging was performed after the administration of intravenous Definity echocontrast, as per protocol. Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is normal in size.  There is mildly increased left ventricular wall thickness.  The left ventricular systolic function is normal.  The visually estimated ejection fraction is 55% (normal range 50 70%). Wall Motion: All wall segments showed normal motion. Right Ventricle: RV not well visualized.  RV grossly normal in size and function by subcostal view. Atria: The left atrium is borderline dilated.  The right atrium is normal in size. Aortic Valve: Sclerotic appearing aortic valve with no significant aortic stenosis. Trivial aortic regurgitation. Mitral Valve: There is trace mitral valve regurgitation by color flow and doppler analysis.  There is no mitral valve stenosis by color flow and doppler analysis. Pulmonic Valve: There is no evidence of significant pulmonic valvular stenosis or insufficiency by color flow and doppler analysis. Tricuspid Valve: There is trace tricuspid valve regurgitation by color flow and doppler analysis. Great Vessels: All visible segments of the aorta are normal in size. Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size and collapses greater than 50% with inspiration. Pericardium/Pleural: There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

On presentation, vitals were mostly unremarkable other than some mild tachycardia and tachypnea.  Patient was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on room air but was placed on supplemental oxygen for comfort.  Blood work was mostly unremarkable.  ABG was not particularly concerning.  Troponin was negative x3.  Patient underwent chest CTA which showed basilar atelectasis bilaterally and scattered groundglass opacities and scattered borderline size hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with patient's known sarcoidosis.   Patient was treated with supportive care and monitored overnight.  He was able to maintain sufficient oxygen levels.  On the time my evaluation, patient continues to complain of bilateral rib pain worse with deep breaths consistent with costochondritis.  I discussed with the patient that he will need to continue to take NSAIDs on a scheduled basis to help with his discomfort.  Additionally I offered to prescribe cough medicine. I discussed possibly discharging the patient on steroids however he states that he makes a point to avoid taking steroids due to his history of hemochromatosis.

The night of the vaccine I had severe heart palpitations that woke me every 2 hours, but I managed to get some sleep. The 2nd night I could not fall asleep at all. I stayed up all night. 2nd night tried melatonin and benadryl, and only manged to sleep 2 hours very late in the night. This went on for a week. I saw a doctor and was given trazodone. It helped fall asleep but kept waking up every hour or 2 and then trouble falling asleep afterwards. So only managed 3-4 hours of sleep each night. I had side effects from Trazodone with mood changes so had to stop taking it. I saw another doctor based on a friend's recommendation who was going through the same issue. I was prescribed clonazepam 1mg. I was finally able to sleep a full night. I took it for 7-10 days and tried to taper back since I did not want to be dependent on it and wanted to go back to sleeping without  any sleeping aids. Klonopin 0.5mg seemed to be helping so on a follow-up appointment, I was given a months supply of clonazepam 0.5mg. I took that for a week and tried to taper that further and that did not help with sleep.  Amidst of this I started having tinnitus in the right ear and I never had tinnitus before. I don' t know if it was triggered by sleep deprivation, the vaccine or the clonazepam.  But I stopped taking clonazepam altogether after 3 weeks.  9 weeks out since the 1st dose and I can sleep a little on alternate nights only. And that sleep is fractured. So one night of almost no sleep and one night of 3-4 of hours of sleep if lucky. I tried benadryl and it helps a little but the trouble falling asleep is just as severe and continue to wake up every 2-3 hours. 8 hours in bed and only manage 3-4 hours of sleep. I skipped the 2nd dose due to continued issues with sleep.

My (male) partner and I just had my our second doses at 2PM today (it is 4:38PM as I write this). After receiving both the first and second vaccinations, I experienced what I can only describe as -- and pardon my phrasing here -- being as high as absolute balls. Like, just-ate-a-marijuana-edible high, only I had not used any marijuana in the 24 hours leading up to the event. I have used my electronic cigarette, but sparingly (those J&J lung blood clot stories were freaking me out), and while I am indeed on both Suboxone and Alprazolam, Suboxone does not produce a mental/physical high, especially in opiate-tolerant patients such as myself. Similarly, I took a much smaller dose of Alprazolam (about .25mg) which is less than 1/4 my prescribed dose, and I've been on anxiety meds for years -- suffice it to say that I was not ""already high"" upon arrival at the vaccine site.  What I experienced included a very strange sort of euphoria and brain fog. It was more pronounced after the first vaccine, but definitely noticeable this second time as well. Both times, my partner was entirely unaffected, which was great, because the effect was strong enough that I'm not confident I could have driven in that state. It is finally wearing off as I write this, but other female friends have reported similar experiences with the Pfizer vaccine, and since the J&J issues seem to affect women only, it may be worth further researching the effect of these vaccines on young females. I am also fairly petite (5'2, about 110 pounds currently) so that may play into it as well. Just wanted to give you all a heads up!

He had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on 4/2/21 in his left arm and states that he did not experience any noticeable reactions after vaccination. He also recalls having had sustained a minor superficial scrape on his left volar forearm by a trash can lid when he had taken out garbage, which occurred very shortly before the onset of this tingling sensation. The tingling sensation then progressively worsened and became more diffuse across most of his body. He then developed fevers up to 102 at home, chills, neck pain, headache, and pain in all extremities (primarily arms but also in his legs).   He initially went to the Health Care ED on 4/28/21. He was afebrile at the time and his vital signs at that time were unremarkable with the exception of elevated diastolic blood pressures (90-104 mm Hg). WBC 10.1 with normal differential, electrolytes and liver enzymes within normal limits. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative. Urinalysis showed few bacteria but no WBCs. Chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was then discharged.   Patient returned to the ED on 4/29/21 and reported fever to 102-103 d F, chills, nausea, weakness, body aches, and bilateral foot paraesthesias. He was afebrile (98.8) and his vital signs were within normal limits. His WBC was slightly elevated to 12.2 with a normal differential. His ESR was 11, CRP 1.5, CMP within normal limits. He was noted to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and he was given tamsulosin.    Patient then returned to the ED again the following day, on 4/30/21, with worsening generalized pain and weakness and difficulty walking.   ED course: temperature 101, heart rate 100s-110s, BP 140s-160s/70s-90s, RR low 20s, SaO2 high 90s. Labs remarkable for WBC 13.1 with 82.4% N, ESR 7, CRP 5.9, lactic acid 2.6, RF 10, urinalysis unremarkable, HIV antigen/antibody negative. Several imaging studies were performed. MRI T spine showed ""Extensive cord signal abnormality in the cervical and thoracic cord as detailed above, with associated expansion of the cord (most pronounced in the cervical cord).

Moderna Vaccination Side Effects Report May 13, 2021  First Vaccination ? February 11, 2021 I did not have any effects the first week.  Then on the very same day of the week, in the following week, my arm, where I got the injection, got red and swelled up nearly from my elbow to my shoulder.  It was hot and hard and ached.  It was sore to the touch.  That was on Thursday.  On Sunday, I woke up OK, but as I dressed and started moving around, things did not feel right.  Soon, I knew that I was not going to be able to do the normal things of the day.  Within about an hour of being up from bed, I had a sever attach of vertigo.   I thought is was actually Vertigo, which I sometimes have, so I tried the ?exercise? that you can do to remove the debris from the ear canal and relieve the Vertigo?. This has worked for me in the past.  But, after trying it three times?. Barely being able to perform the procedure because of the severity of the Vertigo that I was experiencing, my daughter said that it might be from the vaccination.  She helped me to my bed.  I could not stand or move well.  Any time I moved my head or my eyes?even if they were closed? everything would spin more.  No matter what I did, I couldn?t the spinning to stop.  Finally, after I held my head and eyes very still, I fell asleep and slept for 7 hours straight.  When I finally awoke, the dizziness had begun to subside.  I slept for 2 more hours and started to feel more normal the next day.  The swelling and pain in my arm stayed for another 2 weeks.  Second Vaccination ? March 11, 2021 I had the injection in the afternoon and did not notice any real issues that day.  On the second day, when I awoke, I did not feel well?kind of dizzy and nauseous?.but not the Vertigo type of dizziness?just an off balance sort of dizziness.  Then I noticed that I couldn?t move or think very well.  It was like everything was in slow motion.  I tried to do the normal things of the day, but finally just gave up and went back to bed.  It was like my mind was watching everything go on in slow motion.  I slept the whole day again.  The next day I was mostly better, but after a couple of weeks, I started having frequent momentary dizzy spells.  They did not seem to be triggered by anything.  They just came and went.    The dizzy spells went on for several weeks? probably a month and gave way to another reaction that is difficult to explain because I have never had this experience before.  It is like when I move around or turn my head, my eyes do not go with me!  It is not a dizzy spell, although it does cause some dizziness.  And, my eyes do not go out of focus.  It is more like they are out of ?alignment? with each other or something like that.    It is very disconcerting and takes 1 to 3 seconds to come to correction.  It is happening more and more frequently.  That would be probably about 80% of the time that I move my body or my head.  It is now May and it does not seem like the side effects are abating.",,,,,,,,,N,02/11/2021,02/18/2021,7,None,PHM,,"Alendronate, MicroDaily with CoQ10(vitamin), AREDS 2, 42 Fruits & Vegetable Capsules (vitamin), Nattokinaise,  Citrus Bioflavonoids, Lion's Mane, Fish Oil",None,None,,,2,05/13/2021,,,,Codine

From my understanding: A dermatome is the area of skin supplied by a particular nerve. The varicella zoster virus lies dormant in the cranial and spinal nerves. When the virus is reactivated, it travels along the affected nerves to the area of the skin served by those nerves, where it causes a distinctive, stripe-like rash.

It was reported that the patient had his COVID vaccine shot done on the 13Jan2021, his first shot and he had rashes all over him, on his right leg. A week went by, now this is one week and then it was Wednesday and he had an appointment with the doctor. He said he just needed to go and see the doctor. He went to the doctor, came home and he said that the doctor said he got shingles. The wife mentioned that they got three girls and they wanted them to have their shot and they did get their shot. This was a week ago, a week later and the patient put nothing on him. His was all red. The wife stated that the patient didn't have shingles and didn't want him to take the medicine. It was a medicine for every 8 hours, three times a day. The wife said every medicine has a side effect because she was a nurse. The wife said that the patient shouldn't take the medicine and what he did, he took it. So the patient took his medicine (unspecified medication) and about three days later, he was vomiting, he had headache, his stomach was upset and he was walking like, he is 76 years old and he looked like he was freaking 100 years old. The wife was really upset. She told their daughter that the patient doesn't listen and would listen to her. The daughter was in her house and the wife said she needed to come and see her dad. The wife wanted the daughter to come and say to the patient to stop taking the medicine. The daughter did and the patient stopped it. The wife was feeling really bad because the patient was looking really sickly and she was not used to seeing him sick. The wife stated that it took him another week to get better and he stopped taking the medicine and he started doing the Neosporin. So for both of them, the wife put it on the patient and on her own. The wife was making sure he puts it on every time he took a shower, she put a new set on and put a bandage and things like that. Granted that his scar was a little bit deep and brown. It looked like shingles. The wife called the doctor and said that the patient did not have the shingles and that she has the same thing on her leg and that she was sure it was not shingles. And if it was, they were putting Neosporin on it and taking care of it and it's drying up and he was not taking that medicine anymore. She also added that the doctor didn't take any CBC, and that they should have taken a CBC to confirm if it was that or rashes. She said not only the CBC and that the doctor could have done other tests to confirm it but didn't do it and didn't appreciate that.

It was also reported that after 1st and 2nd dose, there was injection site pain in right arm. After second dose she developed shingles, or what was later found out to be shingles, she had extreme pain in her hand. She thought it was injured or something, it was very painful. She got shingles blisters on her hand, and then also got some on her arm, the opposite arm as the injection. Her dermatologist and internist verified it was shingles. Her internist said it may have been triggered by the vaccine. She clarified it started in the palm of her hand and then traveled up her arm on the opposite side of the vaccine, she got the vaccine in the right arm and the shingles in the left arm. She felt quite ill as a result of the shingles. Her dermatologist put on Valtrex, three times a day. It helped with the spread; it stopped spreading. Her dermatologist was not associating it with the vaccine, and she was not sure she was either. After not feeling well for several days she told internist and he was confident that the vaccine was what caused the shingles. She doesn't remember for sure the event extreme pain in left hand, but it was within a few days after the 2nd dose. The swollen glands started within 24 hours, as well as, the sore arm. It wasn't anything she didn't expect. Like with the flu shot maybe a little worse, but it wasn't severe. Her sore arm was not ongoing. It recovered completely by the next day.

A 62-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 30Mar2021 at 01:00 PM (13:00), as first dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history included bipolar depression from probably 10 years ago (2011) and ongoing, torn rotator cuff (15 to 20 years ago), and food poisoning in mid-Aug2020 (maybe it was more than that; may get tested to see if he ever had COVID-19). The patient's concomitant medication included vilazodone hydrochloride (VIIBRYD) from 2017 and ongoing (for at least four years) for bipolar depression. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was one of those people who doesn't get sick and he doesn't normally get the flu shot and everyone told him to get this Pfizer vaccine. The patient was not panicking but got the first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine on Tuesday (30Mar2021) around 01:00 PM and saw some things about having soreness on the around the shot site and all of that from that night (30Mar2021). This is going on for three days (from 30Mar2021) with severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; if you ever have pulled a rotator cuff it feels like that and he has not slept in almost 3 days due to pain from 30Mar2021. The pain is severe at times that it makes him nauseous (Mar2021). He figured the soreness was normal and later in the evening on 30Mar2021, the pain became an issue when he tried to go to bed that evening. Since the first two nights compared to last night, the soreness is actually improved; every time he tries to sleep with pain as a factor it is not easy. The patient can feel throbbing with his heartbeat and with the circulation there is throbbing pain. The pain was terrible and was throbbing like his heartbeat and similar to like a shoulder rotator cuff injury. For the first two days, on Tuesday (30Mar2021) and Wednesday (31Mar2021) after the vaccine, he could not use his arm or lift his arm above his mid face level. According to the patient, it was like a rotator cuff and he had a torn rotator cuff 15 to 20 years ago and this is the same arm that his torn rotator cuff occurred in; this is very painful and he is comparing it to the torn rotator cuff. In Mar2021, the patient had burning and tingling down the left arm and 3 days no sleep because the pain is worse at night. During the last week (Mar2021), his left leg down to his foot is also tingling and burning. The patient's primary care physician just retired, and he is in the process of finding a new one. The patient had no treatment or physician or emergency room (ER) visit for the reported events because being in the ER field, he can tell right now that it would be a waste of time of the effort to go into the ER as they would do nothing but tell him to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) and that is it. The patient did not like to take paracetamol and hates taking paracetamol. The patient clarified it is generic acetaminophen extra strength (Strength: 500 mg; Lot Number: P119682, Expiration Date: Mar2022, UPC Number: 5084417594) that he has taken (maybe every 6 hours oral) and it does relieve the pain so that is only so good. He does not know if in motion of the course of the day, something happened because at night laying still in bed is when he has pain. The patient did a lot of research before he made this call and the severity of the pain is enough to actually keep him awake for three days. He thought it was severe pain; maybe he should have told them to administer the vaccine in his right arm, but it was administered into his left arm. The only reason he made this call was because he wanted someone to know what he was having which could be just completely normal and he is sure every reaction is different and he expected the soreness because he remembers as a kid having shots. Also, this level of pain he is experiencing is what he wanted to report; imagine having  himself going three days without a full night of sleep and he wanted to report this to make sure Pfizer knew this if they were keeping track of numbers of how many people have a similar pain level. The patient also asked if there were other people who called and reported these symptoms and if there is any information or treatment recommendations. As of 08Apr2021, even up to five days after getting the shot, now going on seven days that he has had some pretty severe reactions. The patient called in after 3 nights of getting no sleep. The patient was calling today to see if someone was ever going to call him back and asking will there be a follow up call from someone to see if he's still alive. The patient had some pretty severe reactions and they have actually gotten worse. There also have been new developments. The patient had pain in his arm that pulses along with his heart rate. It is so bad that it kept him up for 3 nights and still wakes him up at night. The pulsing pain in his arm started on the first night and has gradually gotten worse. The pain in the arm that is enough that it keeps him awake at night only starts getting severe when he goes to bed. He has tried sleeping in an upright position and he has tried everything, and nothing seems to alleviate it. The patient took generic acetaminophen which did not work during his last phone call. The patient also tried naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and that doesn't work wither. It was absolutely debilitating at times to where he has a 50% deficit with the use of his left arm (Mar2021). The patient initially reported burning and tingling sensation that was on his left arm and went to his hand and fingertips but now it has progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot. He is a retired paramedic and is pretty sure he is not having a long stroke. The patient feels it is too long to have symptoms from a shot he got. The patient has a lot of friends in the medical field and he's been told even going to a primary care physician, it is kind of gray area when it comes to dealing with COVID-19 vaccines. The patient was having second thoughts about getting the second shot. He had been told he can take NSAIDS over the counter for pain which has not helped him; there is no protocol for diagnosing or treating anything that happens from the shot. People in the medical field have told him there is thin line now to treat side effects because of liability; some doctors won't even get into it, just refer to Pfizer because medical insurance will not cover any services related to COVID-19 vaccine reactions. The patient continues to explain that is why the federal government is the only one that owns the shot due to liability. The patient's main concern is calling and reporting and maybe getting some help in deciding whether or not to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. In his opinion, that is too long to have pain that he cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up. This all happened along with the shot, the same night and there are times where he can't work due to it. The patient asks if anyone is concerned with it and will someone feel bad because he doesn't get the second shot. His main concern is that people are underscoring or even lying about side effects, stating he can't believe he is an isolated case. The patient continued to ask if this is something he's stuck with, or if it is something he would have to deal with from now on from getting this shot. The patient regrets getting the first shot and stated that if he knew then what he would be going through now, he wouldn't have got it. The patient has no sort of history of being a hypochondriac and the feelings he is going through right now are sensations that he has never felt in his life. The patient continues to explain he doesn't even know how to categorize it other than mentally relating it to the shot since it all occurred in line with Mar2021 getting the shot. The patient further commented that if he ran a call with an ambulance right now with a patient telling him what i he was telling the company, he wouldn't even know what to do with them other than getting them comfortable and to a hospital. The patient had not recovered from ""Soreness on the around the shot site"", ""Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is"", and "" Has not slept due to pain; cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up"".

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 22Apr2021 12:10 (at the age of 61-year-old) as unknown single for COVID-19 immunization. This report was not related to a study or programme. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was first time had flu shot made her very ill, next year doctor suggested she should just have half of a shot instead of full shot to see if she tolerated it and she was able to tolerate that. She had not any other problems with flu vaccines in general. Some of the other vaccines, she was just supposed to take Benadryl with them because of some of the filler ingredients people put in things. She had previously had the 1 dose shingles vaccine, but she had gotten probably shingles probably a couple of months after that so they encouraged her to get the 2 part shingles vaccine at a later date and told her to do the pre-medicate routine like Benadryl day before, day of and at least 2 days after shingles vaccine doses and if any major problems call for help. She did not have a noticeable problem from the 2 part shingles vaccine. Some of the times depends on what filler ingredients people use. She was allergic to nutmeg which was used as an emollient oil or it's called Myristicin something or other oil; if something has too high a dose of mannitol it can cause a problem. She has a very long list of allergies and high sensitivities; if it was a high enough sensitivity it goes in allergies list, even though it may not be a true allergy. Family has lots of allergies. Regarding prescribed indication additional details: She had 3 doctors who initially advised her to get the vaccine including her primary care physician, oncologist and haematologist; this was because she was a high risk person because of various health issues. Her haematologist 2-3 months ago when she had her last appointment with him he was saying to get the shot and prescribed the epi-pen at that time; no one was having it yet, but he expected she would have some sort of reaction to it not able to be covered by Benadryl alone. Medical history included ongoing platelet disorder Verbatim: Unidentified platelet disorder, Lots of allergies, cardiac murmur, ongoing asthma, osteoarthritis, glucose tolerance impaired, hypoglycaemia slow thyroid and back and neck pain. Concomitant medication(s) included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for hypersensitivity (50mg taken as needed), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for hypersensitivity (10mg daily), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma (250/50 twice daily), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism (137mcg-1 tablet daily), methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) (20mg tablet twice daily), salsalate, colestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT) (2-500mg tablets 3 times daily), sucralfate (CARAFATE) (1mg tablet 4 times daily-dosage verified with caller as milligrams and captured as provided), loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]) (2.5/0.25 takes 2 tablets of that 4 times daily), calcium carbonate (CALCIUM OYSTER SHELL [CALCIUM CARBONATE]) (Alternates dose of 500mg and 1000mg on days takes Vitamin D), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) (250 mg), vitamin D (50,000 units every other day taken), vitamin B12 (1mg injection every 14 days), clonazepam (KLONOPIN) (2-1mg tablets at bedtime), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma (10mg tablets at bedtime) and cefixime (FLEXERIL [CEFIXIME]) taken for back pain, neck pain (10mg tablets 3 times daily as needed). On 22Apr2021, Onset time: She had a note saying her eyes itchy at 12:20, but they were itching before that because she waited long enough to report it; so onset time was less than 10 minutes when her eyes started itching. Then her pulse; she could feel chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard. They did check her pulse while she was in their initial observation and her pulse was only in the 70s, but oxygenation was at 96%.When at doctors office less than 1 hour before that reading, oxygenation was at 98%.Recorded at 12:30 eyes itching much worse, throat felt like it was starting to tighten, heart felt like it was starting to race. By 12:50 hands were starting to swell. She had already been pre-medicated with Benadryl before this before she went down to get the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, she had Benadryl in her system. She had that same morning with her morning meds had taken Zyrtec and Benadryl in anticipation of getting the possibility of getting the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine because she has to pre-medicate for vaccines just in case she starts to react in anyway. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines was not administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Emergency Room taken from the location where vaccine administered-they gave her Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot had her sit for basic observation then sit for extended observation. In that time period telling them her symptoms were going on, increasing. They gave her another 50mg Benadryl even though she had already had 1 before and then called emergency room, took her down, left her in waiting area even though she had heart and chest palpitations. Physician Office seen prior to event on 20Apr2021, seen after event 27Apr2021. Primary Care Physician didn't hear anything in lungs either visit. Not admitted to hospital; seen in emergency room, theoretically she got treated; however her basic blood pressure and stuff even with what they were doing was higher than when she was triaged in the ER; blood pressure was up and something else,oxygenation level moderately reduced from when she came down to when she was just let go; however her symptoms were worse when she was leaving than when she got there. She knows what they gave her while she was there was IV of normal saline, solumedrol and IV Benadryl. Thinks they later gave her Tylenol tablets. Finally got them to do an EKG because kept saying her chest was getting worse but that was several hours after she was back there even though came there having chest pains. In her opinion this hospital was not taking reaction seriously. Not admitted to hospital even though symptoms were worse and blood pressure higher on discharge, well above her normal levels. Currently trying to get them to explain why they took so long to do anything for her. Finally did a chest x-ray on 22Apr2021:discharge papers say abnormal x-ray and they gave a couple of different possibilities as to what that might be so Primary Care Physician wrote a prescription to get a follow-up chest x-ray to make sure that everything is fine and back to normal and not ongoing or progressing or anything because they gave some strange things: what their impressions were: findings: there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. It says the left lung appears clear; cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits; impression restates non specific right findings there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. This was from front and lateral views of the chest x-ray at 19:00pm 22Apr2021. 2 ECGs: She guesses this is what they call EKG not, relevant point is that in the notes there for the records: Says abnormal ECG compared with blah blah blah, hard to find when exactly they wrote this, trying to get the exact wording for each of the two. Machine results CED, which caller explained is what they call themselves now instead of ER, notes for MD interpretation; one done at 17:53 , other at 21:32. They both say there was slightly different readings, however both say abnormal ECG. One of the wordings that is in both. She had no further details to provide regarding relevant testing/investigations. She had to be in the ER back in the room for several hours before they would do the EKG and that's only because she said I have chest pain and standard procedure is to do an EKG, had been back there for hours, they had done no tests, the only thing they did was basic blood panel, had not done a troponin or heart enzymes test, had not done EKG that's why she knows they were not taking her seriously at all; if someone says chest pains and you don't do anything in the standard protocol they are not taking you seriously. On this Monday, 2 days ago she had gone down to pick up the records from the ER to go to Primary Care Physician appointment 27Apr2021, finally actually got to speak to someone who said they would get back to her on 27Apr2021 to look into why the EKG tests were not done for someone having chest pains. That's one of the first things you do for someone having chest pain, no matter what the source. Frustrated with them because they're still not communicating back, they had not taken her seriously while she was there; unknown if they were actually going to be reporting, as they were still trying to convince her to get the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. If she reacted to the first dose in first 10 minutes, second dose could be much more of a reaction. With the amount of anti-histamines in her system with Benadryl and Zyrtec and she was still starting to react in under 10 minutes. It's possible to be one of the inactive ingredients but she doesn't see anything in the pamphlet provided that she could identify at first glance as being the culprit to the problem other than 2 possibilities: potassium chloride and other is monobasic potassium phosphate. There is a possibility of her having a reaction to those because she was known to react to certain potassium products; sometimes it was the inactive ingredients. She definitely would have wanted to get the second part of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine series until after she was not getting the medical attention she needed after reaction to the first dose. Because ideally you're supposed to have it at the same location, that just made her very nervous at the prospect of worse reaction at location that did not take her serious the first time. She was a big fan of Pfizer thought they do a great job; she had not known it was a 2 parter, not that it should make much difference. When her Primary Care Physician was saying second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was out of the question and she had been saying to people that she did not think it would be prudent to take the second part, they kept trying to say oh you need to get the second part, talk to so and so so they can convince you to get it, and doctor is going no. She reacted to ringers lactate or lactated ringers whatever the name is, her retired nurse sister sat and watched her getting some ringers lactate prior to surgery for her tear duct and saw her starting to break out in red splotches, patient said she was itching. Action taken in response to the events was drug withdrawn. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

A 74-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Mar2021 at 10:40AM as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hives, rheumatic fever, cataract surgery and lobectomy. The patient received shingles vaccine in 2018 and pneumonia vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that she had no symptoms from the first dose, maybe she felt a little tired. 15-16 days after receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine, on 9 Apr 2021, she developed a rash. The rash was itchy. She has not changed anything about her life style. She has not changed where she lives, laundry soap, or diet. In the past, if she has had hives, they have been very little. The rash on her now is moving around. The rash moves around from her bra line, stomach, back and left side of her neck. The left side of her neck is also itching. The rash does not hurt. Clarified that the rash does hurt a little bit. She describes that she wants to scratch the rash, clarifies that it almost feels like poison ivy where she wants to itch it. On 12 Apr 2021, she went to see a nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner prescribed her a high dose hydrocortisone cream USP 2.5% (Lot number: AC11168, Expiration date: 20 Nov 2021) and it did not do much good. It only helped a little bit, whenever she was using it together with Benadryl. The rash also moved to the back of her neck, and side of her neck. She was excited that maybe the COVID vaccine aggravated the shingles vaccine she received in 2018. She received the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Lot number: ER8731), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15 Apr 2021 at 10:40AM. Before she received the second dose of the COVID vaccine, she showed her rash to the nurse at the hospital. The nurse at the hospital said that she saw redness and bumpiness, but the nurse recommended her to go ahead and get the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The nurse stated that she was surprised they did not give caller a steroid shot. She happened to have a routine yearly appointment with her dermatologist on 21 Apr 2021. By then, the rash had gotten worse because she had to stop taking Benadryl. She had to stop taking Benadryl because it was making her blood pressure go high. Since stopping Benadryl, the rash got worse, and was itching and swelling up. Benadryl lot number: unknown. She states that it was written in white writing and she can not read it. Benadryl NDC: 50580-226-51 Benadryl expiration date: unknown. The dermatologist prescribed her an antihistamine and a cream. The very next day, Thursday 22 Apr 2021, the rash was almost better. From 22 Apr 2021 to 26 Apr 2021 she was doing good, and not bad at all. She still had hives in little places that would move around. The rash had not gone to her legs or top of feet. The rash was basically around her waistline. She has been using cold packs and taking two antihistamines a day. She was doing pretty good for a couple of days, until the right side of her leg swelled up. The rash is still there, and it hurts. She is continuing using the antihistamine cream and cold pack. She was anxious to see if her rash gets worse about 15 days after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine. Since her rash appeared about 15 days after receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine. Her doctor told her that her rash could very well be from the COVID vaccine. Her doctor told her that the COVID vaccine could have aggravated something in her body. Whenever she was five years old, she survived rheumatic fever. She has never had any problems with the shingles vaccine or pneumonia vaccine. She does not get the flu vaccine. The COVID vaccine did not affect her arm at all. She was only a little tired. She is tired now. She thinks that she might be tired now because she is taking an antihistamine. Antihistamine name, lot number, NDC and expiration date: not provided. Her dermatologist said that he did not want to give her a steroid shot, because that would be one more thing to add. Her dermatologist also said that a steroid shot might not last long enough. The morning the rash had moved. The rash was worse on the right side, upper part of her leg, towards her hip. The rash was also on her buttocks. All other areas are okay this morning. She does not have any allergies to mediations. She has been through several surgeries here and there. She has never had anything like this happen before. This is the first time she has ever experienced anything like this. She first noticed it whenever she was outside working in the yard. The rash started on her knee. She had been kneeling over a little bit. She put some old cortisone cream on the rash on her knee and then it went away. On 10 Apr 2021, the rash was really bad. It will still there on 11 Apr 2021, and she could not get an appointment with her primary care physician. She would say over all that the moving rash is generally getting better. Expect for this morning, whenever it came back on her right side. She knows that the rash is not from her laundry detergent. She knows that the rash is from the COVID vaccine. Because of her age. Her and her husband both received the COVID vaccine. Her husband did not have any symptoms, and her husband is older than her. Her husband went through cancer treatments. She was calling to report symptoms after receiving the COVID vaccine. She was asking if she called the right place to report her symptoms. She was calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She does not think Primary / Prescribing Healthcare Professional Info is necessary to include because she has not seen her primary care physician about her symptoms. Her and her husband talked to people who had COVID that were younger than them. Those people told her and her husband that they did not want to catch COVID. Those people missed a lot of work because of COVID. Her and her husband wanted the J&J COVID vaccine at first. Her and her husband were going to wait to get it, but it was not offered in their area. She was really glad that her and her husband chose to get the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the COVID vaccine because she does not want COVID. She does not have any medications, medical history or testing that she feels is relevant to include. She had cataract surgery years ago. She has a chip in her breast from a lobectomy. Caller did not wish to clarify or provide any more information. She asked to not include that in the report, because it was not relevant. All of her surgeries were years ago.

First shot was February 25, she did fine, the second shot was April 22nd and she had a horrible reaction at 30 min.

1316639,05/14/2021,MI,51.0,51,,F,,"She got her vaccine, she felt the burning sensation all the way down to her fingers and her wrist.  I proceeded to go forward and wait the 15 minutes.  She then started to have pain in the side of her neck on the right side, discomfort and pain in her arm.  Within the hour she started to have headaches (has had COVID in the past).  She went home and it was a nagging pain in her arm, not at the site but the whole arm was sore and limited using the arm due to the discomfort.  That night is when she came on the news and started that the vaccine was being pulled from administration.  That night it was like a pulling sensation right in her upper arm, up near the armpit and the fatty tissue from the breast and where you raise your arm.  When she started noticing the discoloration started in her skin.  Her hands started getting black, under both arms were black, the back of her legs was black, and she started feeling worsening fatigue.  She started getting worried and was looking at how her veins turned purple blue/green just in the one arm.  She was trying to figure out why she had limited use of her arm, and was holding it as if she had a sling on it as when it hung to her side it had the pulling sensation and a crawling sensation in her veins (that night and going into the next day).  The next morning she was so exhausted and tired, as was her mother who had the vaccine at the same time, and was not feeling well.  She was feeling that possibly due to the fibromyalgia she was have worsening symptoms than her mother.  She then started bruises on her body, on the arm itself as if somebody grabbed and squeezed her arm, purplish/black bruising.  It had her forearm develop 3 large pockets of swollen, almost as if the medicine was sitting in her arm.   She was slowly getting the pulling sensation down to her hand, and she called the UC first and due to the high volume of COVID she wanted to know how long of a wait she would have.  They instructed her to go to the ER due to the development of the blood clots on the news.  There was no change in her symptoms, and got to the point that she could not move her arm, and the knots stayed in there and there was a reddish discoloration around them.  Now she was having a pulling sensation in her chest and palpitations of pain near her heart.  She was having soreness in her legs to the point that she was not able to walk, and felt it was in her nerves 3 days after the vaccine.  She stayed in the bed the entire week just due to the exhaustion and effects.   Every time she would go to reach for something she would have the pulling sensation down to her hand, and the entire arm was swollen with the bruising all over.  Her body started having purple and blue knots and also in the left leg.  Her arm and fingers were swollen as well.  She then started having itching of her arm, and her lips started swelling and got up and went to Hospital and was able to be seen.  She was having problems with her stomach as well, having a knot in the stomach where it was protruding and started loosing weight since the vaccine.    The ER doctor told her she had a reaction to the vaccine, and did a Doppler to see if she had blood clots.  They did not give her the results and didn't feel that she didn't have problems.  She also went to the UC and back and forth to the ER, and still had the knots and finally looked at the knots and her jaw was swollen, and her arm was still swollen.  The UC told her that she was having a fibromyalgia flare.  She is still having the same symptoms green/blue and have started protruding.   Due to the fatigue she has mainly just stayed in bed and knew that she was to have COVID symptoms, but knows that the crawling sensation and the knots sitting in her arm, and now her arm looks disfigured and the swelling is not going down.  They told her that the test was negative for the blood clots.  She had made an appointment with her neurologist and has an APT on Tuesday 5/25/21.

I reported it to the staff, and they consulted with each other before the nurse who gave me a shot came over and asked me more about it. She was surprised by it and said she hadn't seen that reaction before. She then googled and found it does sometimes happen. I was kept longer for observation and then went back to my office to eat and drink before getting on the road, thinking that might help. I figured it was just a temporary vaccine side effect and didn't think much about it at first, (Wondered if my reaction could have been pronounced since I had COVID in February.) But then the tingling symptoms didn't go away and came and went without a clear pattern. I have experienced them in both hands and feet; sometimes all extremities at once, sometimes just one or two -- on either side of the body or one extremity (a hand or a foot, sometimes more in the fingers, sometimes in the hand). While I may notice it more while I'm sitting, it doesn't go away when I walk. Then about a week or two after the vaccine (about a week or two ago), I started finding myself putting my hand to my lips or left side of my face because I felt slight numbness there. It started at my lips and a cm or inch spot around my left cheekbone, but more recently, it is my lips and a larger swath of my lower face. Always or almost always left side of my face. So here I am today, three weeks after the vaccine and I still (daily) feel tingly hands and/or feet and slight numbness on the left side of my face and lips.

He will not go see a doctor yet because he thinks it will go away. He started wearing compression stockings the day before  last and it has helped.  I am worried that he has a blood clot but he  thinks that it woudn't be in both feet. Not sure if it matters but he is a 61 year old man .  with no known co morbities. Is this a side effect that has been recorded? I am concerned but dealing with a stubborn man.,,,,,,,,,N,05/01/2021,05/02/2021,1,,UNK,,,,,,,2,05/14/2021,,,,
