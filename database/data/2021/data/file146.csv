PRIVACY, MD Specialty: Internal Medicine Relationship: PCP - General   PRIVACY    Next Steps: Follow up in 1 week(s)   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Shortness of breath, altered mental status   HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 68-year-old female who was admitted on 12/17/2021 for symptoms of COVID-19 found to be positive.  Patient is vaccinated but no booster.  Patient never became hypoxic.  The symptoms resolved and she improved.   Abnormal UA Positive for nitrates, leukocytes, and bacteria patient was given Rocephin for 4 days but urine culture came back with mixed flora.  Blood cultures had no growth to date.   Altered mental status Mild cognitive impairment Intermittent confusion, agitation, forgetfulness.  Throughout this she was continually oriented x3, but would intermittently refuse care and even noted herself to feel confused.  This improved per patient, she states she was also hallucinating use and this is improved.  Drug screen was negative, since acute cystitis was ruled out and electrolytes remain normal concluded this is polypharmacy and/or early onset dementia.  During hospitalization patient's Elavil has been discontinued using p.r.n. Mirapex for restless legs, Seroquel a Norco had recently been discontinued but believe patient was continuing to take these at home. HCF did evaluate patient and did diagnosed with a mild cognitive impairment with a Moca-B of 13/22.  Do question a early onset dementia and may need further workup outpatient.  Patient is alert and oriented x3 she is able to make her own decisions.  Due to her waxing and waning decisions, concerns with housing and financial issues social work did consult APS who will check in with patient.  Patient's son told her that he would stay with her in the interim. PT/OT met with patient and did recommend home health which has been set up by care management   AFib Per our records patient had not been feeling her anticoagulation, she has a lapse in her insurance coverage for medications and states that she cannot afford the Eliquis/Xarelto.  Her insurance is supposed to renew with a new year.  We sent Eliquis to my our pharmacy and gave give cards to cover for 1 month coverage.  Will have her follow up closely with her PCP to ensure that insurance has renewed to cover this and re-prescribe.   Now that we have some distant supervision via son and a safe social discharge plan, patient is medically cleared to discharge.

She had presented to the Ed with 6 days of complaints of symptoms. She was found to be hypoxic and results showed positive for COVID 19 pneumonia. There was concern for a superimposed bacterial infection. She was vaccinated for COVID 19 with the J&J vaccine in 5/2021, and overdue for her booster since 7/2021. She was admitted and started on IV steroids, remdesivir and IV antibiotics. She continued to require oxygen supplementation. Today, she complained of feeling like her arm was hurting due to the IV, which nursing has had a difficult time with IV sticks requiring ultrasound guided. Her current IV flushing well without any sign of redness. She refused steroids on day of discharge and voiced that she just wants to go home. She insisted on going home against medical advice. Risks of leaving were explained up to the possibility of death and she verbalized understanding of the risks and still insists on leaving. We will have her evaluated for home oxygen prior to discharge as she was requiring 2L n/c. We will also discharge her on antibiotics to complete a 5 day course. She was instructed to follow up with her PCP ASAP and if she worsens or not improved to return to ER. Patient verbalized understanding. Paper was reviewed with 2 RNS witnessing her agreement.

I had taken benadryl right after I got the shot.

So it appears that my reaction to the Pfizer shot is worsening.""   Allergists response:  ""In my experience, patients have similar symptoms with both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Due to the risk of thrombosis, I do not recommend the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for someone your age.  In the future, I would recommend taking Benadryl before you get the vaccine. We could also consider adding Singulair (prescription) which can sometimes help. Please contact me before your next dose and I will prescribe this.""

Less tight than before, JSYK.  1:55pm I took 2 benadryl after talking with the RN and EMTs at the vaccine administration site.  2:02pm My tongue started to tingle and swelled slightly  2:19 pm My jaw and nose started to itch.  3:19pm All of the reactions subsided  3:30pm  Benadryl sleepiness overwhelmed me and I slept for about 6 hours until 9:30pm. When I woke, all was back to normal. Or at least my version of normal ^_^  Per the watch I wear which has a heart rate monitor, my heart rate was 85 BPM after the vaccine which is a slightly higher resting heartrate than normal Per the app it's between 69-73bpm.

She has been advised to increase her fluid intake in the short term.    DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus [U07.1, J12.82] COVID-19 [U07.1]   HOSPITAL COURSE: 66-year-old female with a past medical history significant for immunosuppression due to history of liver and renal transplant who presented to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, diarrhea, and shortness of breath on exertion.  She was found to have COVID-19.   Patient did require oxygen on admission to the hospital.  Based on her duration of symptoms and need for hospitalization with oxygen use, she was precluded from monoclonal antibiotic therapy.  Her mycophenolate was held in the setting of her acute illness.  Her prednisone dose was thought to be in need of increased and she was placed on initially methylprednisolone and subsequently after that 40 mg of prednisone daily.  Her tacrolimus was held on admission and tacrolimus level was checked in the setting of AKI.  With her AKI, it was suspected that she was suffering from volume depletion therefore IV fluids were started and Nephrology was consulted.   Patient was seen in consultation by Nephrology who agreed with holding tacrolimus and mycophenolate initially and providing IV fluids.  Patient was also seen in consultation briefly by Gastroenterology by Gastroenterology had nothing to offer in regards to use of the patient's immunosuppressive agents.  Patient's transplant service was contacted and they agreed withholding mycophenolate and once tacrolimus level came back greatly elevated at 28, they also agreed with holding of tacrolimus.   Patient was found to maintain adequate oxygen saturation on room air shortly after admission but did desaturate significantly with ambulation was thought to qualify for home oxygen.  She overall felt better shortly after admission with the use of IV fluids and supplemental oxygen.  After repeat tacrolimus level came back at 16, after discussion with the University transplant service, patient was thought to be okay to resume her tacrolimus morning of 12/24 at decreased dose of 2 mg.  Patient was also advised to consume more liquids as her renal function overall improved from a creatinine of 1.85 on admission down to a creatinine of 1.32.  As she was anxious to go home for the holidays, she was allowed to be discharged home on 12/23/2021 with repeat labs to be done on 12/27 to further evaluate her tacrolimus level.  She has also been prescribed a short course of tapering prednisone.

Patient was evaluated at an outside facility after a fall and being too weak to get up from the floor at approximately 4:00 a.m..  Patient reported that she was unsure if she had struck her head and family members found her on the floor and she had been incontinent of urine and was too weak to stand so she was brought to the emergency department.  She was noted to been diagnosed with COVID pneumonia approximately 10 days ago.  X-rays ordered at the outside facility demonstrated fractures of right ribs 4 through 6 along with age-indeterminate fractures of T5 through T7, T11 and T12. While at the outside facility developed persistent hypoxia satting 88% room air requiring 2 L nasal cannula. She was transferred to our facility for multiple rib fracture, COVID pneumonia and hypoxia.   The patient states that today around 4:00 am she was using the bathroom and when she stood up she was attempting to ambulate with her walker but was too weak and fell. The patient states that she remembers the entire fall and denies any syncopal symptoms. Patient states that she was not having any chest pain, vision changes, palpitations, lightheadedness or vertigo. Patient denies any cardiac history, or history of prior seizures or strokes. Patient states that she is not on any blood thinners. The patient's daughter is present at the bedside and states that she had attempted to contact the patient this morning but she did not answer. She went over to the patient's assisted living facility and they let her into the apartment where she found the patient wedged between the toilet and the cabinet. The daughter states that she got there around 10:30am so the patient had been down for approximately 6 hours. The daughter states that when she arrived she did not note any blood on the scene. Daughter also reports that the patient was alert and oriented x 4 when she arrived and displayed no post-ictal or post-concussive symptoms. Daughter contacted EMS as she was not strong enough to lift the patient off of the ground. The patient and daughter endorse that the patient is on day 10 of COVID-19 symptoms, she took a home test that was positive last Friday. The patient also admits to 2 prior falls earlier this month again stating that she fell because she was just feeling too weak. On evaluation here in the ED the patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 2L NSL. The patient had tenderness to palpation over the right lateral chest wall, breathe sounds were equal and intact bilaterally. Patient states that she has pain in her back while lying flat and has tenderness to palpation over her right elbow and over the right fibular head. The patient was log rolled and had tenderness to palpation in the upper thoracic spine and upper lumbar spine. Gluteal squeeze was intact. Patient had intact sensation and strength throughout all extremities. Patient had multiple coughing episodes during the interview and evaluation. Given her continued chest wall pain a CT scan of the Chest abdomen and pelvis will be obtained to better evaluate her rib fractures. An x-ray of the right elbow, knee and tib-fib will also be obtained as she had tenderness to palpation over these points.

Hospitalized at Hospital, discharging doctor: MD Hospitalist.    Discharge after hospitalization 9/23-9/27/21: Patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with remote history of colon cancer with remaining ostomy, former smoker, documented history of COPD though I do not see any PFTs on file who presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of generalized weakness, weight loss, cough, night sweats, shortness of breath. He was positive for COVID-19 and met sepsis criteria. CT scan of his chest was notable for a consolidation throughout the right lower lobe with questionable 9.5 x 6.3 cm mass in the superior portion. Also a right hilar soft tissue attenuation likely causing narrowing of the right middle and lower lobe bronchus. He was initially requiring 3 to 4 L of oxygen. And was treated for postobstructive pneumonia with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, Flagyl. He was also started on on Decadron because of his positive Covid test. The patient is vaccinated however ID felt that there were also some imaging findings to suggest active Covid pneumonia here and perhaps that was playing a role in his hypoxemia. Case was discussed with on-call pulmonary medicine who recommended treatment of his acute infections and have the patient follow-up as an outpatient for further evaluation of his lung mass. ID was consulted and recommended a prolonged course of antibiotics given some concern for possible lung abscess formation. He was discharged on 3 weeks of Augmentin and with the plan that he will be seen in ID clinic before antibiotic stop date to determine whether he will need a longer course. He was discharged on 4 L of oxygen. . The patient's oxygenation remained stable and he felt significantly better at time of discharge and ready to go home. He also had 1 set of blood cultures that were growing 2 different organisms. This was thought to most likely be a contaminant however repeat blood cultures were drawn to ensure there is no persistent bacteremia. These will be monitored after discharge  DIscharge summary after hospitalized 10/4-10/7/2021: Briefly, this is a 69 y.o. male with PMH significant for recent COVID and Right lung mass with post-obstructive pneumonia on home o2 and augmentin who presented with worsening right lower anterior chest pain. Found to have completely collapsed RLL and enlarging mass on repeat imaging. Changed to unasyn while admitted and had CT-guided biopsy 10/4 that showed probable adeno of colonic origin with history of colon/rectal cancer in 2012. Pain was eventually controlled with every 6 hr oxycodone, and Dr did not feel benefit of XRT was worth risk as there was no specific culprit area obviously causing pain, therefore entire 11 x 7 cm mass would need irradiated. Plan to follow up with Doctor on Nov 1 to discuss palliation. Will stay on augmentin to prevent relapse as doubt RLL will ever be open again unless responds to palliation, and have follow-up with clinic.",,,,,Y,8,,,Y,03/12/2021,09/23/2021,195,Ordered Test:  SARS-CoV-2 RNA Resp Ql NAA+probe     Ordered Test Codes:  94500-6 (LN LOINC)/     Status:  Final     Specimen Source:  SOFT TISSUE SAMPLE     Specimen Site:  ENTIRE NASOPHARYNX(181200003)    Specimen Collection Date/Time:  2021-09-23 18:56:00.0   Results: *  Resulted Test: SARS-CoV-2 RNA Resp Ql NAA+probe    Coded Result: DETECTED    Numeric Result:      Units:     Text Result:      Reference Range From:  Not Detected    Reference Range To:     Performing Facility Details:  Date/Time: 2021-09-23 19:59:02.0 Performing Facility: HOSPITAL Facility ID:    Interpretation: Very abnormal    Result Method: LAB DEVICE: CEPHEID GENEXPERT DX SYSTEM     Status: Final    Test Code:     Result Code: (SCT/    Result Comments:  Critical value(s) called with read back verification.,PVT,,tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 0.4 mg CAPS Take 0.4 mg by mouth daily (after breakfast).,"?

I have had a significant loss of mobility and use of my left arm and hand as it feels similar to when you've had a limb that has fallen asleep and you suffer the intense tingling and discomfort. Sleep, working on my computer, cooking etc has all been painful as the pain is constant and does not diminish nor go away for any period of time. I have cut and burnt my fingers as I have a loss of mobility and sensitivity on all fingers other than a mild impact to my thumb. I had hoped that given time it would dissipate however it has not. My most recent symptom is pain and intense itching in my left palm and increase in the tingling in my elbow. Dr. prescribed a week of steroids in addition to gabapentin to assist with the pain. Unfortunately, I am almost at four months post injection and the pain continues to be chronic and has not reduced in it's intensity.

1982100,12/27/2021,TN,70.0,70,,M,,"No adverse event at the time of injection, except normal muscle soreness. Early in the morning of 25 December, three and a half days after the injection, at approximately 06:00 hours, just prior to the event, I had experienced some arrhythmia, which usually signals low electrolyte levels; so I took one potassium pill (Klor-Con M20, 1500 mg). immediately after taking the potassium, I began trembling and feeling weak. Suddenly, and without warning, I began shaking violently, and my blood pressure and pulse began to rise rapidly, getting faster and faster, accompanied by severe lightheadedness, as if I were about to lose consciousness. There was no chest pain. I fought the urge to pass out and managed, with difficulty, to call 911 on my mobile phone. By the time the EMTs arrived, the feeling that I was going to pass out had abated somewhat, and my thoughts were not as cloudy, but I was still shaky and weak. I managed to go outside when the ambulance arrived and walk to the ambulance that was parked at the curb. The EMTs took me into the ambulance, where they took my blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (pulse), and did an EKG. My initial BP was, I think, around 197/99, and my pulse was, if I recall correctly, around 125 (slower than it was when the episode began). The EKG was normal. By the time they took my BP, Pulse, and EKG, everything was dropping. When my pulse rate dropped to 90, and my BP had stabilized, they asked if I wanted to go to the hospital to have them examine me, and I said no. After the EMTs left, and I sat down in my home, and I began to feel better. I monitored my blood pressure and pulse. My BP steadily dropped and leveled off at 137/77, with a pulse rate of 79 bpm (beats per minute). At 07:30 hours, I took my regularly scheduled dose of Hydralazine (vasodilator). By 08:30 hours, my BP had dropped to and leveled off at 124/75, with a pulse rate of 72 bpm. My BP remained at 124/75 after the event ended. I am not sure if the event was an adverse effect of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine; but I think it was, because I have never had such an event happen to me before. It seems to have caused a depletion of potassium; because after the potassium began to get into my blood stream, the symptoms began to abate. By the time I took the dose of Hydralazine, the symptoms had disappeared, and I felt calm and relaxed. As I said at the beginning of this narrative, there was never any chest pain at all. It was not a heart attack or other heart event, except for the dangerously fast pulse. Today I had another attack of weakness, but my pulse did not exceed 90-95 beats per minute; and the symptoms abated a few minutes after eating two bananas and the potassium from them began to get into my system. The reason why I cannot say for sure that it is caused by the COVID-19 vaccine is because I have a tendency to not eat right at times, and I don't consume enough foods high in electrolytes to keep my electrolytes optimized. When my electrolytes get low, I am usually warned by a couple of arrhythmias, at which point I either eat foods high in electrolytes, like potato, sweet potato, or banana; or I'll take a Klor-con M20 potassium pill. Either of those solutions will begin to act within 20-30 minutes, and will raise my potassium level and stop any symptoms. I also take a magnesium supplement, plus a multivitamin with magnesium, Vitamin A, and B complex. For the two days  prior to the event, I had not eaten much, just one meal a day for the two days prior to the event. Whether the low electrolytes was brought on by the vaccine or was just the result of not consuming enough electrolytes, I am not certain. What I am certain of is that I have NEVER had such a severe episode until after I received the Pfizer booster shot.",,,,,,,,,Y,12/21/2021,12/25/2021,4,"Blood Pressure, Pulse rate, EKG.",OTH,,"Armour Thyroid, Amlodipine Besylate, Aspirin (low-dose), Hydralazine (BID); Klor-con M20 Potassium (1500 mg qd) as needed; Magnesium (400 mg qd, as needed); Vitamin D3; MK-7 (Vitamin K2) (100 mcg, qd); One-a-Day Men's 50+ Multivitamin (qd)",None,High blood pressure; had Quadruple bypass February 2019.,,,2,12/27/2021,,,,Cortisone; Iodinated Contrast Medium for CT scan; Benadryl; Raw Celery (not allergic to cooked celery); coriander seeds; Hay fever.

He has a history of PE, CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, stage III CKD, prosthetic aortic valve, partial nephrectomy due to renal cell adenoma, Hodgkin's disease.  Patient was fully vaccinated against COVID.  He was found to be positive for COVID in the emergency department and was mildly hypoxic and was placed on 1 L of oxygen.  Chest x-ray showed large left-sided pleural effusion.  Ultrasound of the left lung confirmed the diagnosis of large left-sided pleural effusion.  Patient was started on dexamethasone and remdesivir due to concerns for hypoxia secondary to COVID pneumonia.  He also received azithromycin and Rocephin due to concerns for possible associated community-acquired pneumonia.  He underwent thoracentesis on 12/20/2021 of his left lung which was consistent with transudative pleural effusion.  The cause for his transudative pleural effusion is most likely secondary to his history of congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease.  Patient was recommended to follow up with his primary care physician as outpatient and was told that he might require an echo as outpatient. He was on room air on the day of discharge and was feeling significantly better hence was discharged home on room air after getting evaluated by Pulmonary Rehab Service.  Patient's blood pressures were soft at the time of discharge with systolic in low 100s.  Hence he was asked to continue to check blood pressure at home every day and stop taking blood pressure medications if his blood pressure dropped below 100/60.

When I went to the ER my bmp was elevated to about 150, so they ran bloodwork, x-rays of my chest, and observed me for a couple hours.

I had an awful 48 hours after the vaccination as well, my body clearly was in a state of fighting something.   After the second shot, my reaction was even more profound. The day I had the second shot of the series, within a few hours I had the worst headache of my life. I had to leave work and went home and cried. It felt like an ice pick was being bored into my head. Within a few hours of the shot, I also started feeling intense tingling all over my body. It lasted for MONTHS. My hands became even more stiff, and I struggled to do even small things. I also became lethargic, and I felt weak all of the time. My hands and feet in particular tingled so much I dropped things constantly. I couldn't think of anything else for months. It wasn't until just a couple of months ago that I have started to feel better. My mentor and I talked about it constantly, as it effected my work so badly. My income was impacted, I could only work about 70% of the hours I did previously. While I feel mostly better, I still have frequent tingling in my hands.

I went to a hospital in the middle of the night when the tightness persisted. They took and EKG and an MRI but didn?t find anything that stood out.   On November 3rd, I began having heart palpitations. They were on and off. Went away Nov 6th but back on Nov 10th. The palpitations then turned into tightness. This has been on and off up until today. About 4 days ago on December 22nd, I began having shortness of breath when I try to take deep breaths.   I met with my doctor in late November and they took an EKG and blood test but thought the palpitations may be related to stress. They did notice the fluttering heartbeats. They prescribed me Metoprolol to help with the palpitations and that has helped but it is still happening although it is more tightness than palpitations now.   I then met with a cardiologist and wore an EKG monitoring device that I could activate when an event was happening. They said my heart was ?operating as it should.? This was late November into early December. I am meeting with the main cardiologist to run some more tests next week and to get his opinion.

Company comment: This case concerns a 30-year-old, female patient with no medical history, who experienced the unexpected non serious events of arthritis, throat tightness, dysphagia swelling, tonsillar inflammation and somnolence and expected events of rash and hypersensitivity. The events occurred approximately 6 days after the third dose of mRNA-1273. As reported, the patient experienced a rash on her forehead, inflamed joints, and her throat closing up. She explained she had inflammation in her joints in both knees, her right ankle and foot, both of her thumbs and her ja. Patient stated her throat closing up as she couldn't swallow, her neck and tonsils were inflamed. Twelve days after vaccination she went to medical facility and was given a shot of methylprednisolone and two days later she went to the ER and was tested for strep, had a neck and chest xray to look for blockages. All came back negative/normal, as reported. The patient was given Benadryl to stop the allergic reaction and was also given a prescription for hydroxyzine which made her drowsy. She also took ibuprofen for pain. Considering the temporal relation of events and description of symptoms the case was assessed as non serious. Causality for somnolence was assessed as not related as hydroxyzine provides likely etiology. The benefit-risk relationship of mRNA-1273 is not affected by this report.

Relevant medical history included: ""acid reflux"", stop date: 2005. The patient also stated that he was very healthy prior to 02Jul2021. There were no concomitant medications (reported as no other products, concomitant Products was none, nothing). Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect: None.

Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine: None. AEs following prior vaccinations: None. Aside from growing up and having minor issues, he was taking Prevacid and like Accutane back in his college days, he was very healthy up until 02Jul2021. He has never taken any vaccines and or shots other than minor shots when he was young. He was a healthy young man other than the fact maybe he was having possible potentially relapses from antibiotics he took years before, but he has never experienced anything like he has experienced after the COVID vaccine.  The following information was reported: CYTOKINE STORM (medically significant), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""Cytokine storm""; MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (medically significant), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""thinking he was either having  a heart attack""; HYPOAESTHESIA (non-serious) with onset 09Aug2021, outcome ""unknown"", described as ""Numbness in hands, both arms/numbness""; TINNITUS (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""tinnitus and ringing in his ears""; BURNING SENSATION (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""burning throughout his body""; MUSCLE TIGHTNESS (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""tightening in the back of his triceps""; DYSPNOEA (non-serious) with onset 17Aug2021, outcome ""unknown"", described as ""Shortness of breath""; MUSCLE TWITCHING (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""twitching in the back of his calves""; PALPITATIONS (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""heart palpitations""; HEAD DISCOMFORT (non-serious), FEELING ABNORMAL (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"" and all described as ""immense head pressure (brain fog)""; GASTROOESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (non-serious), DISEASE RECURRENCE (non-serious), outcome ""recovering"" and all described as ""Acid reflux""; ANXIETY (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""anxiety""; MIGRAINE (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""migraines""; LOSS OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE IN DAILY ACTIVITIES (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""was not able to do work because of this intense pressure and headaches""; HEADACHE (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""headache""; PAIN IN EXTREMITY (non-serious), outcome ""unknown"", described as ""a little bit of soreness in his arm"". All the events were evaluated at the physician office visit (he had seen multiple doctors all over the United States trying to figure out what the hell to do for the symptoms he has been experiencing after the COVID vaccine) and emergency room visit. The patient underwent the following laboratory tests and procedures: extensive tests: (unspecified date) unknown results; Unspecified test (unspecified date) cytokine storm, notes: One test was conclusive that he had a cytokine storm. Low levels of VEGS showed he never really had COVID; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): (17Aug2021) migraines; vitals: (17Aug2021) normal. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of head discomfort, feeling abnormal, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, disease recurrence, migraine: normal over-the-counter products including Prevacid, Pepcid, Omeprazole 40mg, Extra Strength Excedrin. Clinical course: He confirmed his first vaccine was administered on 02Jul2021 and then he took the second vaccine on 23Jul2021. He had no issues with the short, maybe a little bit of soreness in his arm like everybody was saying, but he was not willing to take on the sickness that began after having the vaccine. His worst fucking nightmare began on 09Aug2021. On 09Aug2021, he woke up with numbness in his hands for the first time in his life. He filed a VAERS report immediately after experiencing the numbness on 09Aug2021. He needed Pfizer to explain how they say the vaccine is safe and effective when knowingly there has been biopsies proven small fiber neuropathy as a post vaccination complication. It's not only happening with him, there are thousands of threads of people having the same thing (not specified)"" (pending clarify). People who had COVID got that ""shit"", but he didn't have COVID, he just took the vaccine. He went on the PRIVACY website where these information regarding purposed pathopsychological vaccines and said that the study identifying a case of small fiber neuropathy as a post vaccination complication. The caller states it was a 57 year old women with the same exact symptoms he had and also thousands of symptoms he is seeing online. The patient stated he took another test through a telephone program with Dr. PRIVACY. The patient has never had COVID but he did have a Cytokine storm take place through COVID long hauler's program. It's not only with COVID but they are also seeing vaccine related issues. He has never had that before. He was offered 2 repurposed drugs for the tinnitus and ringing in his ears. One of the repurposed drugs as Maraviroc, which is an HIV drug also supposedly from Pfizer. He clarifies in the United States, it's called Selzentry. But he hasn't taken none of them. He has never done repurposed drugs , he doesn't believe in that shit. He doesn't do antibiotics. The other drug was a statin his doctor suggested. The patient clarified further Dr. PRIVACY prescribed Pravastatin because he cannot find any doctors who will prescribe the Selzentry. For the Pravastatin, the patient clarified this medication is brand new. He has not started taking the Pravastatin yet because he has never taken any repurposed drugs. The patient provided the following details for the mentioned Pravastatin: Strength: 10mg, Quantity: 30; the prescription was filled on 07Dec2021, the prescription is dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. The drug expiration is Dec2021 and refill one time by 07Dec2022. The patient explained that on 09Aug2021, he developed complete numbness in his hands, his whole entire hands and both of his arms were numb. The real nightmare began nightmare began experiencing a burning sensation throughout his entire body, it was like a hit and miss throughout the day. The patient  confirmed he had the numbness in his hands and arms. He had tightening in the back of his triceps. He also had burning throughout his body that would come and go and also go into his lower body. It was the weirdest experience of his entire life. On 17Aug2021, he ended up in the Emergency Room because he felt he had shortness of breath. He clarified the last ER visit was 2012, but nothing prior to this. He clarified he went to PRIVACY and reported to VAERS that day. People think he is freaking crazy but he is not. It was the twitching in the back of his calves that got him going. The patient wanted to know why does he have twitching in the back of his calves. He ended up in the hospital (When probed to determine if he was hospitalized or only seen in the ER, the patient clarified he was only seen in the ER where he was triaged) thinking he was either having  a heart attack because of  the palpitations happening in his heart and the immense head pressure, supposedly they call it brain fog, that pressed and rushed through the top of his head. The same day in the ER and the following days, he was having palpitations happening in the top of his head. He explained they didn't have an idea of what to do because of course all of his vitals came back normal. He left PRIVACY on 17Aug2021. He still had what he felt like were heart palpitations and also experienced acid reflux like there was no tomorrow. It was so bad it re-activated the acid reflux he had after 16 years of it being gone. It all of a sudden came back with a vengeance. The COVID vaccine re-ignited his acid reflux. He was told it was just his anxiety, but the COVID vaccine caused him to have the anxiety which caused the acid reflux. He couldn't get relief with normal over-the-counter products including Prevacid, Pepcid so Dr. PRIVACY prescribed Omeprazole 40mg (it was in a white bottle) which finally got it. Dr. PRIVACY prescribed it only because he had tried all of the over-the-counter stuff including Pepcid, and Prevacid, all the 24hr and extra strength stuff, and nothing was working. He had to take Extra Strength Excedrin for the migraines. He had an MRI done following his ER visit and it showed he had migraines. He has never experienced any migraines or never even had any headache issues extensively prior to having the COVID vaccine. He may have had a headache intermittently, maybe because his eyes were strained from work, but nothing like this. He had to start taking Excedrin Extra. Strength Migraine literally over 40 some days which is not good for his stomach. His immune system was impeccable or superb so there is still no reason he should have had that reaction. He can only attribute the reaction towards the vaccine. He was having twitching in his calf muscle. He mentioned after taking the Omeprazole because of the acid reflux and head pressure which is of course brain fog, ""it was so bad"" it knocked him out. He was not able to do work because of this intense pressure and headaches which lasted up until the end of October-November. He later clarifies during the call, the acid reflux finally tapered down. The omeprazole was not the cause of his headaches. The headaches came with his ER visit, he felt a wave of pressure come over his head. It has nothing to do with his prescriptions. He is no longer taking the Omeprazole. The caller state not only did he have an MRI, but he had extensive tests done at PRIVACY.",,,,,,,,,N,07/23/2021,08/09/2021,17,Test Name: extensive tests; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:unknown results; Test Name: Unspecified test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Cytokine storm; Comments: One test was conclusive that he had a cytokine storm.

I sought medical treatment but the Doctors all said they didn?t know what it was so they didn?t know how to treat it.  After about 3 weeks, it went away as quickly as it gave come.  I did not correlate it to the vaccine until about a week post COVID-19 booster on 10/08/2021 I got what felt like neuropathic pain in my feet and going up my legs.  The only way I can describe it is that it was almost as if every one of my nerves were activated.   They felt sore like I had been in them for day, I had shock pain that would take my breath away, on top of the fact that my feet and legs also felt like I had been  burned.   The pain was so terrible me that I couldn?t stand it and it actually made me have to keep moving.  The first ER I went to did not take me seriously.   The morning prior to had taken every pain medication I had in my cabinet, when nothing worked, I took something different but nothing even came close to touching the pain.   When the doctor at the facility thought it was in my head, I left and then went to Health the next day where the doctor (listed in this form) treated me with, I believe Lorazepam which helped.    I spent the weekend taking baths as that was the only thing that gave me relief in between doses of what the doctors prescribed.   My Tuesday, the pain was tolerable but when I say tolerable it was still a 7 out of 10 for the rating scale ? but at least it wasn?t a 10/10 like earlier.  I have never been in so much pain I?m all of my life.  It never got below about a 5 for the next three weeks and then just like before at 3 weeks is just went away.  I woke up one morning and it was like the pain had never existed.    I did not know about this forum until today or I would have reported it earlier.    My medical history is psoriatic arthritis which I am not currently taking medication for (it has not been bad enough to warrant it yet) and some sort of a nerve disorder that a doctor years ago at the clinic had suspected for which she prescribed lorazepam as well and that helped.  Historically I will have shooting nerve pain every so often that is just a quick burst of pain but goes away immediately.  I would say it happens perhaps 4 or 5 times a month.    I am currently  having g a relapse, however not as bad as the last episode.  I suspect that it will just go away at 3 weeks like the others.  I know correlation is not causation but it would be quite a coincidence for the exact amount of time post vaccine that I have these symptoms.

I then received my second dose of Pfizer on June 30th (after reassuring myself it was not the vaccine), and 13 days later, the hives returned. This time they lasted 4 months, and got progressively worse the entire time, resulting in more trips to urgent care and more rounds of steroids.

The pain went up the left side of the back of my neck and up into my head and temples area. No OTC medication was working to decrease the pain, this was a new and severe type of pain for me. I went to the ER on July 29th, and because I had the J&J vaccine, they tested me for blood clots- which at this time was negative. The ER Dr. treated me with a migraine cocktail and sent me home. Over the course of the next two months I was in the ER five times for the severity of the pain. I was seen in primary care and prescribed muscle relaxers and Imitrex and Maxalt migraine meds during that same two months. The sharp shooting ""nerve"" pain was easily triggered by doing tasks I use to consider routine and did without a second thought. Any exertion would trigger a headache that would last all day and into the night. Sleeping was difficult and often interrupted by pain. In mid-September I was referred to Neurology for help, where I was prescribed new medications but they like primary care Drs. had no answer as to why this was brought on. MRI's on my head and spine were ordered to rule out serious conditions. On September 30th I had sharp chest pain on the left side of my chest and I went to the ER. Blood work indicated I may have a blood clot so a chest x-ray and CT scan were done which confirmed that I had pulmonary embolisms in both lungs. I was placed on Xarelto, a blood thinner for six months, at which bloodwork will again be done.",,,,,,,,,,06/30/2021,07/29/2021,29,"Since July 29th I've had a multitude of blood test panels done, a head CT scan (8/1/21), MRI of my brain (8/14/21) and cervical spine (9/8/21).

I have never been to the Dr. as much as I have in the last six months. There is no doubt in my mind that this was brought on by the J&J vaccine.

She was tested for Covid and influenza in the clinic which came back negative.  She was instructed this is a viral illness and needs to pass on its own.  She stated that she has been using her inhaler and her daughter's nebulizer without much relief.  She also complains of right lower chest pain.  She denies any swelling in any of her extremities.  Her last fever was this morning.  She stated that the shortness of breath just comes and goes at times.  Patient was treated for UTI last Monday and was on Macrobid.  She noticed over the past couple of days she had had a reddened flat rash on her bilateral lower extremities.  She stated is very itchy  Atrial fibrillation with RVR I48.91   The patient is not ill-appearing or toxic upon arrival to the emergency room.  Her heart rate is tachycardic in the low 100s.  It is sinus rhythm upon arrival.  She did have clear lung sounds.  Patient does have a history of asthma which she feels like is not very controlled at this time.  Patient is moving air well, oxygen levels remain in the mid to upper 90s with room air.  Patient's D-dimer did come back elevated at about 1700.  We did do a CT of the chest to rule out a PE.  There is no acute PEs noted but possible inflammation or metastasis to the bilateral lymph nodes in the hilar area.  We will treat the patient with Augmentin for 10 days to see if we can help decrease the inflammation and have her rescan at that point by her primary care doctor to rule out any suspicious lesions.  While she was in CAT scan and when she came back, the patient was in A. fib with RVR.  She states she never had any issues like this before in the past and her shortness of breath does get worse with the faster heart rate.  Otherwise she is asymptomatic.  The patient was given a bolus of Cardizem and an oral dose of Cardizem with minimal relief of the elevated heart rate.  I did go from the 170s/180s to the 130/140s and still in atrial fibrillation.  I did contact the cardiologist and he recommended avoiding Cardizem due to lack of evidence that it will be beneficial for her in the outpatient setting and starting her on 400 mg of amiodarone twice daily for 2 weeks and then decreasing to 400 mg of amiodarone daily after the initial 2 weeks and to follow-up with him in 2 to 3 weeks for an echo and reevaluation.  The patient will be started on VTE prophylaxis with Eliquis.  The patient stated that she has been on this before and is unsure why.  She said that she was on it when I thought she had Covid because I thought her blood looked thick.  Denies any history of abnormal heart rhythms though.  Her CAT scan results as well as the plan of care were discussed with the patient as well as her primary care provider.  They are agreeable with the plan of care.  Her PCP was comfortable with not further treating her heart rate more than what the cardiologist said due to lack of being symptomatic.  The patient was instructed that she is at risk for stroke due to the atrial fibrillation and that we are trying to prevent that with the blood thinner.  She verbalized understanding is agreeable.  The cardiologist denied any further intervention needed.  We will put her in the hospital for observation on telemetry.  Patient denies any further concerns. The Doctor notified a plan of care and is agreeable.  I do suspect that the patient's rash on her bilateral lower extremities is due to a medication reaction.

1988694,12/29/2021,NE,53.0,53,,F,,Patient presents the emergency room with a 2-day history of increasing confusion not eating much or drinking much.  She was confused when she came in not doing well.  Blood sugar in the ambulance was 46 upon entering the emergency room it was 14. Initially upon entering the emergency room we are unable to do a review of systems secondary to her mentation.  Once we got the IV finally started start some fluids her mentation did come around.  Initially she was complaining quite a bit of back pain confusion weakness.  Apparently has been going on for couple of days.  Talking with her husband on the phone and the only medication she taken is some tramadol and ibuprofen. Initial physical exam sure to be quite confused somewhat resistant to our cares.  She had to be reminded again and again to hold still.  3 attempts were made at starting IVs all unable to get there.  She was supposed to get D50 secondary to her low blood sugar but we are unable to do that she did drink a container of orange juice which did perk her up a little bit.  Anesthesia was called in to get her IV started.  In the meantime the lab drew very little blood but again enough to see that she was in acute renal failure her blood sugar was back up to 38.  Her hemoglobin was at 8.8.  Multiple examinations were done while she was in the emergency room the final exam is the one that will be documented here.  Initially HEENT is fine other dry mucous membranes her heart was regular lungs were clear abdominal exam was benign no complaints of pain to palpation.  Later on that changed and she was having some back pain. Patient is confused she has had low blood sugars her blood pressure continues to drop she is in acute renal failure as far as we know for sure renal failure.  She is anemic.  We have very little history on her as she is unable to give us much history and there is nothing in the hospital.  I need to admit the patient get a hydrate her to get her blood pressure up order to monitor her blood sugars I will recheck her kidney function and hemoglobin in the morning.  In the meantime we will get the monitor her oxygen saturations her blood pressure pulse and her blood sugars as they continue to drop.  I still have some lab pending we will follow up that closely. Patient is extremely confused this morning.  During the night we are trying to hydrate her with a creatinine of 5.2 there was no change this morning.  She started to fluid overload so we stopped the IVs try to give her Lasix again basically no urine output.  As far as we know she has not taken anything at home other than Toradol and ibuprofen.  My fear she took too much but were unsure still why her blood sugars are bottoming out and why she is so confused.  This morning we will do a CT of her head and do a CT of her abdomen and I will follow up with these.  Will need more lab work and wait till after the CAT scans to see if there is something else we need to order.  Plans are to try to transfer her to a nephrologist depending on her findings.  We need the CAT scans first. Patient's renal failure is no better.  She has huge calculus in the ureters which is obstructing the patient's urine flow she is getting no fluid output she is in dire straits at this time. In the emergency room patient sensation would clear then should be confused again.  Blood work was okay other than her blood sugars continue to stay low.  We initially gave her D50 a couple times.  It was difficult due to the fact that it took for 5 attempts at starting IVs to get 1 that would work.  When I did start working we started hydrating the patient significantly due to her low blood sugars her blood pressure and such.  Has a picture started to clear she started to become more confused.  She would have moments of normal sensorium and then she would be quite confused again.  Again her blood sugars were staying low so we did start her on D5.  After she had a couple liters and it was noted that she was having difficulty breathing and her urine output had been next to nothing.  We did float a Foley initially so we could monitor this.  We did eventually have to stop the IVs but her blood sugars continued to stay low so we started her on D10 at 250 eventually moving it down to 125.  Her vital signs remained somewhat stable.  She had some problems with oxygenation early on but we did give her oxygen which did bring it up into the normal range.  Eventually confused as to why her blood sugar stayed low I did a CT of her head which was essentially normal and a CT of her abdomen which showed enormous renal calculi which was causing obstruction which is why she was getting no urine output.  We had noted that her creatinine was 5.2 the next day it had not improved probably from obstruction.  At this point time her mentation was not clearing she was staying confused the whole time somewhat combative or at least restless.  We have given her Ativan some Haldol to keep her from tearing out her IVs and the nurses and such.  We then attempted to transfer the patient where she can get a higher level of care and we can take care of the renal stones.  We had excepting physician but his Institute had no availability.  We then called approximately 50 hospitals in the 6 state area and had no facility that would take our patient.  We continue to monitor her maintaining her blood sugars her blood pressure then bottomed out and Levophed had to be started.  It is currently running at 34 mics but had been much higher to maintain blood pressure.  Again very little urine output it was noted that the urine she did have out was full of bacteria whites and reds.  We started her on Rocephin.  We did get an opening at the hospital 40 miles away with an accepting physician who states that he can go when and stent her kidneys.  We are currently working on that transfer and as soon as we get acceptance patient will be discharged and transferred to another hospital.  Patient is in and will remain in very guarded condition.,,,Y,,Y,1,,,N,12/08/2021,12/27/2021,19,"UA, CMP, TSH, Hgb A1c, CT abdomen, CT head",PHM,,multivitamin; ascorbic acid; ibuprofen,,Rheumatoid arthritis,,,2,12/29/2021,,,Y,Morphine

I had chills, felt feverish (my skin felt hot), had body aches, and was extremely fatigued. I checked my temperature several times throughout the day, and the highest temperature I had was 99.1 (my normal body temperature is around 97.8-98.0). I noticed that the soles of my feet, the palms of my hands, and my groin area were the areas of my body that ached the most. By the morning of December 9th, I felt better, but was still fatigued and the soles of my feet still felt achy. On the morning of December 10th, I noticed that the ache in the soles of my feet was more like a tingly feeling (like pins and needles when your foot falls asleep and wakes back up). Throughout the day on December 10th, I had weird zaps of nerve pain in all different parts of my body. The zaps would last about 5-10 seconds, and some were minor (felt more like itching), while some were more painful (about a 7-8 on the pain scale). I called my doctor's office to see if I could make an appointment, but they could not see me until Monday, December 13th. I decided that if it got worse over the weekend, that I would go to urgent care. Luckily, it did not get worse, but the random nerve pain lasted through the weekend and was still happening on Monday when I met with my doctor. By Monday, it had changed to more of an itchy feeling, but I still had occasional nerve pain zaps that were around 5 on the pain scale. During my appointment, my doctor said that it was possible that I was having a reaction to the vaccine, but she ordered some blood tests to rule out other possible sources of neuropathy. She put in an order for a lipid panel, and to check my Vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid hormone levels. I had my blood work done on Thursday, December 16th (as that was the earliest I could go in due to work), and all results were normal. Since then, the nerve pain/itchy zaps have continued to improve.

She was a little sore in her arm, but nothing extreme. She watched TV and felt really chilled, and put a blanket on. She could tell that she was feverish due to the chills. She decided to go to bed, and bundled up as she was freezing. About 2:00 AM is when it was really bad, but could not find a thermometer and felt it was around 103.  It then broke and she was sweating/dripping wet. She went back to sleep and when she woke up again her head felt like it was going to explode and remembered that she has not had a headache in 30-40 years. Also in the middle of the night she was feeling as if the ventilation in her house was not working as she could not breath. She turned on the constant airflow, and has never felt like that in that place and feels it was a reaction to the shot. Then when she woke up she felt so bad and thought she was probably dehydrated due to the fevers and got some water to drink and not able to drink it due to the nausea. She called her sister as she felt like she was dying and told her she was having a real bad reaction and to have her call her back and check on her. She took some Advil and went back to sleep, and in a couple of hours she woke up and felt better, her headache was better. She did notice in the night that she started to cough, dry cough in her chest. Her sister called and she told her she felt better. Then a couple of hours she felt better. By the next day she felt normal, didn't have the cough, didn't feel the stuffiness, headache and could eat. She choked it off to the bad reaction. The next day she went to make coffee and could not smell the coffee. She could also not smell her perfume and knew it was a symptom of having COVID. She went to get a test and she tested positive for it. He told her to get magnesium and zinc and told her take in the morning and evening, got the vitamins and went home and took that.

Symptomatic day: 6 Current oxygen saturation 95%, oxygen requirement room air Severe Respiratory isolation Will not start Decadron or remdesivir as patient is not hypoxic Daily labs CBC with differential, CMP, CRP, D-dimer  Continuous pulse oximetry Due to pancytopenia TSH was ordered found to be normal.  LDH slightly elevated.  Patient has a history of anemia of chronic kidney disease this is likely the etiology of her low hemoglobin.  Will order B12 and folate even though MCV normal.  Order peripheral smear.  Awaiting blood cultures and urine culture. Her white blood cell count was normal 11/02/2021 and her platelet count 93 was improved.  I think the likely etiology of her leukopenia and thrombocytopenia is related to COVID-19 infection and this will continue to improve.  However will await additional lab results. Threshold for platelet transfusion is 10,000 if no signs of bleeding or 50,000 if signs of bleeding Would recommend starting broad-spectrum antibiotics if absolute neutrophil count drops below 0.500 No signs of bleeding Consider reaching out to Hematology Will ask the day team to reach out about monoclonal antibodies 12/21/2021 note: Patient had worsening respiratory status today and required supplemental oxygen. She denies any chest pain, swelling in arms or legs, or new cough.  Plan:  - Current oxygen saturation 88%, oxygen requirement 3.5L NC - Severe Respiratory isolation - Start Decadron this morning due to increasing oxygen requirements. Patient is on day 8 of symptoms with poor renal function so will not do Remdesivir at this time. Due to rapidly worsening status will start IV Solumedrol this evening and continue with 1 mg/kg/day dosing.  - Start heparin drip due to new onset worsening oxygen requirement and concern for PE. Unfortunately due to patient's renal function she would not be a candidate for CT angio. This also precludes the use of Lovenox. Ordered Doppler US of all 4 extremities. 12/24/2021 notes: Plan:  - Current oxygen saturation 92%, oxygen requirement HFNC 50L @ 65% FiO2, this is marginally better than yesterday. - Patient also has a superimposed bacterial pneumonia which may play a part in her pancytopenia. Treat bacterial infection.  12/29/2021 notes: Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Assessment & Plan Due to bilateral lung infiltrates from COVID-19 viral pneumonia, with probable superimposed bacterial pneumonia, +/- additional atypical pneumonia Strep pneumo urine Ag positive, for which she already completed 7 days of abx (ceftriaxone/cefepime combo) Given chronic immunocompromise (chronic steroids/Cellcept), with recent high dose steroids, atypical process such as fungal pneumonia to be considered Did not require oxygen on admission, but developed hypoxia within 24-48 hrs of admission. Oxygen needs have since been escalated to HFNC 60L 85% FiO2. Most recent CXR 12/27 with mildly improved/stable bilateral lung infiltrates Some fevers on admission, however, afebrile over the past 7-8 days  Continue steroids for COVID-19 pneumonitis, as above AKI has resolved, with renal function now back to baseline.

She was intubated on 12/23/21. Patient was diagnosed with superimpsoed bacterial pneumonia and fluid overload in the setting of COVID 19 pneumonia. Patient was treated with IV antibiotics from 12/18- through 12/27.    Unfortunately in the setting of respiratory failure patient also developed an AKI on her stage 5 kidney disease. Patient was placed on a lasix drip in attempt to creat a fluid negative balance however it became clear to previous IM team that patient would likely need HD or CRRT in order to optimize fluid state.  Doctor discussed with family goals of care on 12/27 and it was known that patient would not want a tracheostomy or HD. At that time it was decided to proceed with comfort care measures and hospice was consulted. Paralytic drip was discontinued at that time. We were unable to terminally extubate patient the afternoon of 12/27 due to paralytics still being active in patient system.  However, later that evening on 12/27 patient became severely bradycardic and went into asystole. Grand daughter was contacted, and it was recommended to remove mechanical ventilator at that point.

1988988,12/29/2021,OR,46.0,46,,M,,"06/11/2021 - COVID VACCINE.  I received a single dose of the Janssen vaccine at pharmacy.  There was initial discomfort at the injection site, in my left arm.  I went to bed that evening, but awoke shortly before midnight with increased soreness at the injection site. There was also significant pain in my lower right abdomen, and it felt as though I were developing a severe cold.  I was unable to stand up straight while walking to the bathroom due to the severeness of the pain in my lower right abdomen.  The injection was on a Friday, and the cold or flu-like symptoms persisted through the weekend.  I contacted my specialist, Dr., on the following Monday or Tuesday to let his office know that I had received the vaccine, and I reported my symptoms to the nurse.  The pain at the injection site began to lessen over the coming weeks.  However the pain in my lower right abdomen appeared to increase in severity based on dietary intake.  Initially, there was a sharp increase in pain immediately following the consumption of food and drink with high sugar content.  This pain continued on-and-off over the coming months, and would sometimes flare up without eating or drinking.  At the height of discomfort, standing or walking was not possible.  Soreness at the injection site began to reappear, at times severe.  08/12/2021 - PRIMARY CARE.  I spoke with my primary care provider about the recurring side effects at the injection site for the COVID vaccine, and the coinciding occasional pain in my lower-right abdomen.  09/10/2021 - PRIMARY CARE.  I met with my primary care provider for a follow-up visit.  I had extreme pain from time to time in the lower-right abdomen around to the back.  I also had increased pain in my knees and ankles, and a sharp pinpoint pain in my mid-back.  There was discomfort in my forearms, and weakness after walking for short distances or when standing for short periods of time.  I often had deep gasps for air, losses of breath, and I was easily winded.  The pain at the injection site had increased in noticeable severity, and I was unable to move my left arm beyond certain positions.  He prescribed Dicyclomine HCL as needed for cramping, which I have not been required to take.  He advised me to speak with my dermatologist regarding possible gynecomastia.  He recommended a fiber supplement, and referred me to physical therapy.  09/15/2021 - DERMATOLOGY.  I met with my dermatologist and inquired about the possibility of negative side effects resulting from finasteride, primarily due to substantial weight gain.  He did not detect the presence of gynecomastia, and prescribed Minoxidil to take in addition.  09/22/2021 - PHYSICAL THERAPY.  I met with the physical therapist at Hospital, and discussed the various types of pain I was experiencing.  This included pain originating at the injection site of the Janssen vaccine in my left arm, and now the shoulder area.  I had previously been treated for issues related to my knees, back, hip, ankles, and feet at a different healthcare provider.  I attended one physical therapy session at Hospital, but did not continue due to a negative experience, which I reported to my primary care provider's office.  09/23/2021 - IMAGING.  My primary care provider referred me for a sonogram due to the recurring pain in my lower right abdomen.  The technician did not notice anything remarkable, noting only that the appendix was not visualized.  10/08/2021 - PRIMARY CARE.  Discussed results from sonogram with my primary care provider.  Mentioned persistent issues with knees, feet, hips, and legs.  Discussed the result of adding fiber to my diet, plus the addition of Minoxidil.  12/20/2021 - SPECIALIST.  Discussed the severity of pain at the injection site of the COVID vaccine, and the inability to move left arm in certain positions without severe pain.  Also discussed recent cold and congestion symptoms, as well as shortness of breath and periodic gasping.  He said that if symptoms persist, that I should consider a booster for COVID.",,,,,,,,Y,N,06/11/2021,06/11/2021,0,Sonogram,PHM,,Genvoya Finasteride Melatonin Cannabis Oil,"HIV/AIDS Pain in knees, feet, hip, and back Randomized and/or stress-induced spasm/jerk in knees, feet, and hands",HIV/AIDS,,,2,12/29/2021,,Y,,None

The doctor mentioned seeing one example of a ""multifocal heart palpitation"" come up on the monitor during that time--while he was actually talking to me at the bedside with me, in fact--but I don't see it mentioned in my discharge summary. Bloodwork was done, and looking at my discharge summary, everything apparently came back within normal range.   The doctor did note in the discharge summary that the vaccine was suspected as a possible cause of my complaint. The occasional symptom(s) persisted on and off for a few days, becoming fewer and further apart until they resolved. I can't recall exactly how many days the symptoms lasted in total.   According to the discharge summary, the doctor appears to have been MD, but I recall seeing two different male doctors over the course of my visit (shift change?).",,,,,,,,,Y,03/27/2021,03/31/2021,4,EKG Continuous heart monitor while I was in the ER bed Bloodwork,OTH,,"Lorazepam 1.5mg QD; Lamotrigine 20mg QD; Famotidine 40mg QD; Magnesium Oxide 100mg QD; Vitafusion Multivites gummy multivitamin, 2 gummies QD; Gaviscon Extra Strength chewable tablets, PRN (Averaging 4-6 per day.","No infections, colds, viruses, or the like.

At 2:15AM on 12/15/2021, I woke up in excruciating pain in my right ankle joint and in my left hip. In my left hip, it was so painful that when I got up out of bed, I could not weight bare at all on my left leg. It felt like severe joint pain with neuralgia type pain. It felt like nerve pain and it radiated into my groin into my hip socket and down to my left thigh on the top. Didn't go beyond my knee, but confined to the groin, hip and thigh. It was severe, and by far the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life. I called my doctor, morning of 12/15. I could not get out of bed and could not walk on my left leg. I had a telehealth visit and they wrote a prescription for a muscle relaxer and order suggested that I see a physical therapist. I have been having lower back pain for a couple years, so they thought it may have had something to do with that. And so that day, I could not work at all and couldn't take care of my animals or myself for the whole day. The next day, 12/16/2021, it was better to the point where I could weight bare on the leg but I have continued to have problems and have moderate pain in that leg and in the hip joint. Still to this day. I saw a chiropractor and that was not at all helpful to me. I have an appointment with another chiropractor to see if we can try to get this under control. It feels like a nerve or neuralgia type pain. I haven't fallen or hurt myself, so I don't know what's caused this sudden flare up. I did have the same thing happen after the 2nd vaccine, but not nearly as bad. And that happened with my right hip, not my left. I couldn't get out of bed and take care of myself. I couldn't work.

They continued in frequency until 4/18 when I went to the ER to confirm that these were benign PVC's, having had one or two prior instances of these 15-20 years ago.  It was later confirmed that they were still benign PVC's.  Prior to the palpitations beginning, I experienced the following:  the evening of 3/16 my lips were red and  inflammed a tiny bit.  This can happen (rarely) after eating something so I attributed it to that.  The following morning, lips were still a little reddish, and I was very anxious (my typical reaction to allergies).  Again I thought I must have eaten something so I bought some Benedryl and took it.  It took another does later to get me back to normal.  At the time I did not attribute this to the vaccine altough in retrospect, who knows?  By 3/29 I am experiencing seasonal allergy symptoms - itchy eyes, runny nose and slightly constipated.  I again did not attribute this to the vaccine but rather to going on a trip later than normal and attributing it to vegetation that I don't normally see because we are usualy home. This continued up until the palpitations began.  The palpitations finally tapered off and stopped in  July.    When I received my booster on 11/4, I had a few palpitations again but they were fleeting.    Other than a very slight fever with the booster, I didn't see anything else.

It felt like something was stuck in my chest. Every time I ate something, it would make the pain worse. I kept drinking water and dealt with it as much as I could. On 12/15, I told my husband to get me some TUMS and it seemed like it eased up a little bit. I used those daily 3 times daily. 12/16 came and I chewed the tums and they didn't help much. I took the Pepto Bismol and I got really sick after and I threw up the Pepto Bismol and the food and I was sick. I told my husband that I needed to go to the ER and thought that it wasn't the indigestion but that it could be my heart. So they told me I had to wait a while and they finally hooked me up to the EKG and they did a blood test and they told me I was having a heart attack. They gave me a regular aspirin to chew and the pain went away but they told me I was still having a heart attack. They did the test one more time, and they said yes you're still having a heart attack. They admitted me to the hospital and they wanted to do a test with a contrast dye and I let them know I was allergic and they still did one without the contrast dye. They said I had 3 blockages in my heart. They said they could either do open heart surgery or the 3 stents in my heart and opened it up to get the blood flowing in my heart. They told me I had to quit smoking and I smoked up to 5 cigarettes a day and I haven't smoked since the surgery. I never had shortness of breath so I'm not sure. They also gave me a prescription for Nicotine gum 3mg 3 times a day. Doctors said that if I smoke once, I might have a heart attack. They also changed medications: added Empagliflozin 25mg half a tab daily, Atorvastatin Calcium 80mg once in PM, Metoprolol Titrate 50mg half tab twice a day, Promethazine HCL 12.5mg tab twice daily as needed for nausea & vomiting, Tylenol 500mg as needed every 8 hours. They also stopped Amlodipine, Hydrochlorothiazide, and rosuvastatin. Still adjusting to the medications currently, burping, heart rate low recently. Just have to be cautious.

This day was a very busy day from the very beginning and  throughout the whole day, I was doing my very best to manage the flow within the pharmacy given the high volume of patients at drop off, pick-up, counseling, and immunization appointments. When they arrived to the pharmacy for their appointment, we checked both patients in at the drop-off window. They then went through the normal screening procedure before getting the vaccine. Once they were checked-in, they were put in the immunization room with their parent (mother). I then took both patient forms and confirmed all the details on the form with the mother of the two patients. One was 12 years old and the other was 9 years old. Then I proceeded to prepared both vaccines. Once the vaccines were made, I came back into the immunization room with the vaccines ready. Both patients looked very alike in terms of height and body features. When came the time to administer the vaccine, I was under the impression that the mom had told me to go ahead and administered the 12 years old first which led me to get the ""adult Pfizer vaccine"" and administer it. I proceeded to administer the ""adult Pfizer vaccine"" to the 9 years old thinking that I was in fact giving the vaccine to the 12 years old patient given the similarities in body features. But then I realized that I had given the wrong vaccine to the wrong patient. Instead of the ""pediatric Pfizer vaccine"", I had given the ""Adult Pfizer vaccine"" to the 9 year old.  Immediately after administration, I informed the mother. The mother was understanding of the situation. I asked the family to stay around for 15 minutes in the room to make sure that everything was ok before they left. When they were leaving, the 9 years old patient  was feeling ok. I then followed up with the mom a couple hours after to make sure everything was ok with the patient. I then also proceeded to contact Pfizer but their medical department was already closed for the day. I will follow-up with Pfizer again and I also plan on following up with the patient's doctor.",,,,,,,,,U,12/29/2021,12/29/2021,0,,PHM,,,,,,,2,12/29/2021,,,,

Symptoms persisted for 48 hours. MRIs were negative. Was started on gabapentin. Has had alternating, patchy paresthesias ever since. Patient was previously evaluated by EMG in 2018. Needle EMG at that time was normal.        Exam: Strength is full in the arms and legs. Temperature sense was normal in the arms and legs. Vibratory sense was normal in the fingers and toes (RS 6 in both). Reflexes were 2+ in the arms, 2+ at the knees and 2+ at the ankles. Hoffmann and Babinski signs are absent bilaterally.        Nerve Conduction Studies        The bilateral median, bilateral radial, bilateral ulnar, left superficial peroneal and left sural sensory responses were normal (symmetric or assessed). The bilateral median to ulnar comparison studies were normal across both wrists. The bilateral median-APB, bilateral ulnar-ADM, left peroneal-EDB and left tibial-AH motor responses were normal.        Electromyography        Needle EMG was deferred.        Impression: This was a normal nerve conduction study (no electromyography) of the arms and left leg.        Clinical Note:        Patient has a normal exam. Her primary complaint is migrating/fluctuating paresthesias and occasional sharp neuropathic pains. MRIs of the brain, C-spine and T-spine were normal. Her exam is normal. This nerve conduction study was normal. We discussed that should she develop other neurologic symptoms (vison loss, weakness in arm/leg etc) further investigation may be warranted but it is probably not warranted at this time.        She was started on gabapentin 100 mg TID. She is not sure if there has been benefit as yet. We discussed that at the discretion of the treating physician, increasing the dose of gabapentin to 300 mg TID in a graded fashion would be a reasonable next step.",PHM,,clonazePAM 0.5 MG tablet citalopram 10 MG tablet Symbicort 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler,none,asthma,,,2,12/30/2021,,Y,Y,Penicillin amoxicillin neomycin sulfa

Patient's wife states that the patient has had some loose stools.  His wife reports that he was using the bathroom frequently last night but does not know if he was having loose stools or if it was due to urinary frequency.  The patient does complain of having occasional dysuria as well as urinary frequency.  He states that he is in the hospital but cannot tell me the month, the year or why he is in the hospital.  Altered mental status, unspecified R41.82   Low-grade temp, 37.8 �C, nontoxic-appearing.  Presented to emergency department with altered mental status, patient was alert to person, stated that he was in the hospital.

Patient has a mildly bumped CO2 level of 31, upper limit of CO2 is 30.  It is possible the patient's confusion may be related to hypercapnia however it is very minimally bumped up.  The patient will need to have further work-up due to his altered mental status as it does not seem to be a clear-cut answer to the cause of it.  The patient has been confused for several days according to his wife with worsening today.  Patient did request transfer to Facility, his wife was in agreements with transfer to Facility.  Spoke with hospital, spoke with Dr.  who did accept the patient for transfer.

After visiting the ENT he instructed me to ask my cardiologist for a Heart Monitor. On December 1st I received the monitor and on December 3rd after having an episode at 630am i was later contacted and told my heart had paused for 7 seconds. I was called later that day and told to report to the heart doctor on Sunday December 5th where i was told i would be admitted to the hospital for further testing. On Monday December 6th around 8am i experienced another episode where my heart paused for 5 seconds. around an hour to hour and half later i experienced another episode where my heart stopped for 9 seconds. They performed an ECHO cardiogram and later told me i would need emergency surgery for Pacemaker placement to alleviate my heart from stopping. Surgery was around 2:20 pm that afternoon. Now that I have the pacemaker, my heart is no longer stopping but I still experience the episodes. I still get the right nostril sensation, numbing in my face and the sweating.

When I say that I had brain fog, I mean that when I would try reading something, the words would all run together and then disappear. They would then reappear seconds later, and I would be confused. Afterwards, I would be so exhausted that I would either sit and rest or I would have to go to sleep. One day during a conversation with my granddaughter, she told me that I just ""froze."" What she meant is that during the middle of the conversation, I would have to pause midway to collect my thoughts. I also developed an upset stomach on 11/30/2021; I had to make 4 or 5 trips to the bathroom every 20 minutes. During those trips, I would sometimes have diarrhea; other times, I would have normal stools. Also, the chills I had that day were so intense that I couldn't get warm no matter what I did.

They have shown up on my face, stomach, and legs. When they're on my face, they look like boils. During one breakout, my lips burned, and I had to put an ice pack on them.

The dr prescribed antibiotics and I took them becasue he cautioned that the ear really looked quite bad. I was not in any localized pain, just general symptoms of fatigue , etc. I had not taken antibiotics in 40 years, but I did take them this time, since my body seemed to be very challenged since the vaccine.

When he asked my wife about getting the Covid booster shot, she corrected him and said she was there to get the flu shot, not the covid booster shot.  He left and brought back a new  shot for my wife.  He then gave us the shots, theoretically giving me the covid booster, and my wife the flu shot.  My wife and I have received the flu shot every year for over 20 years, and neither of us have had a reaction.  I had my flu shot earlier this year and had no reaction.   On the other hand, my wife and I have each had headaches after each of the first 2 covid shots we received that lasted about 2 days.  After the shots we received on 12/4/21, I had no reaction whatsover, which is unusual for me with the covid shots, and my wife had a typical covid reaction after receiving what we thought was a flu shot.  Her reaction was redness around the shot area, some swelling, and a mild fever around the shot area, and a headache that lasted off and on for 4 days.  We believe that the technician did the paperwork as if he had given us the appropriate shots, but inadvertently switched the shots when he actually administered the shots.  This would make sense given our reactions to the shots subsequently, where I reacted as normal as if I had received a flu shot (though I should have received the covid booster), and my wife reacted as if she had received a covid booster (though she was supposed to have received the flu shot).  This leaves a two-fold problem.  1) I am not covered for the booster because I got the wrong shot, but the paperwork indicates otherwise.   2) My wife is not covered for the flu because she got the wrong shot, and her paperwork indicates she has not received the covid booster though we believe that she actually has.  We went and spoke to the pharmacist who told us there is nothing they can do because their paperwork indicates they gave the right shots, and cannot view what actually happened because there are no cameras in the room where the shots are administered.  I contacted my physician, and they indicated they have no test they can provide to see if I actually received the covid booster.  They suggested I contact the CDC, which I did today.  They also indicated they have no test that could tell if I received the right shot, and suggested I log an incident with the VAERS to see if they have a solution to this predicament, which is ultimately that I believe I did not receive the correct covid booster shot and I am thus not protected as the CDS strongly recommends (and I would like to be and certainly tried to be).  Is there a test that would show my level of protection now, or could I be approved to receive the booster shot again, and if so, what would the ramifications of receiving the Covid booster shot potentially twice.

The mother brought 3 children, with the other two being younger than Patient. This was the second shot for all 3 kids. The correct vaccine and correct dose was given to all 3 children.  After giving all 3 children their shots, A let her mom know that she was feeling nauseous. I moved the trash can to be next to her. Patient threw up into the trash can and then looked very sick. She was extremely pale, lethargic, nearly asleep after being very ""with it"" and vibrant minutes before. She laid her head on the table in the clinical room. Patient stated that the nausea started when she watched me put the needle into her sister's arm. She said she did not watch me inject her shot, but she did watch me do her sister's shot and that is when the nausea started. Once she was a little less pale and slightly more awake, the family moved out of the clinical room to wait the required 15 minutes before they would leave. The mom asked me if the symptoms could be from the vaccine. I answered yes, but it is very difficult to tell whether it is the shot or anxiety about the shot that is the culprit, especially given the fact that Patient said it started when she saw the needle go into her sister's arm.  The child had no trouble breathing at any time during the event. I asked early on and a couple more times during the adverse event.  I send a text saying ""I gave a 9 year old a shot. She threw up, is very white. No trouble breathing. Do I do anything more than just offer basic support like paper towels and water?"" their response was ""Basic support and if the parents want, we can contact ems.""  The family had moved from the clinical room to wait outside the pharmacy for the required 15 minutes and I checked in with them at least 3 more times during that time. I offered to call ems if the mother wanted me to. She asked what I thought and I replied ""I will call them if you want, but I don't think it is necessary. What I see is that even though she is still very pale, her color is returning and she is getting brighter."" The mom agreed and said she did not think it was necessary either, and since by this time the 15 minute time for all of the kids had passed, and Patient looked a lot better, she would take them home.  Both other children were fine. I did not notice any symptoms in them and the mom did not point any out. The mom did, however, say that Patient had had a similar reaction (possibly more severe) and that they had taken her to a neurologist after it happened. She said that the doctor told them that the extremely heightened fear and anxiety in anticipation of a shot in children can cause that type of reaction. Notably, the mother had not mentioned at all or written in the form that the child had any reaction to a vaccine previously.  The one thing the mom did mention about the kids is that they all had a very slight cough. I questioned about how bad, how often, if any of them had any trouble breathing or a fever and the mom said no to all of those things. Notably, I did not hear any of them cough while at the window or in the clinical room, or outside the pharmacy during the adverse event.  Today 12/30/21 I called mom to check on Patient.

Four days later on Oct 29, patient went to see  Dr. He diagnosed possible appendicitis, and recommended to go straight to the hospital. Patient went to Hospital, after tests they were ready for surgery to remove the appendix, but realized he takes Eliquis for his heart condition. So instead of surgery, he was given antibiotics and had four nights in hospital recovering. Before being released he was given a Flu shot on 11/2/21. On November 21 at 11pm, patient found breathing painful. Then went back to Hospital for the day and diagnosed Pleurisy and sent back home. Then he was gaining about a pound a day of fluid. He started  taking Furosimide 20-40mg and 12.5mg Spironolactone, but surprisingly was not losing weight, but continued to gain weight. Since patient had severe back pain, the doctor had back x-ray done, and nothing notable, so then he had an MRI done of his back. Fluid around the lungs was scene and and arachnoid web at T3 zone. Then December 8th patient complained of pain in his abdomen again, and also had been having severe back pain as well. So off we went to Hospital again. After tests, they found his appendix looked better than the month previous, but the echo cardiogram showed fluid around the heart(pericarditis) and fluid around the lungs. You would have to confirm with the hospital what all was given, but I believe he was given prednisone. He did come home on prednisone and colchicine and diuretics. It took about two weeks for patient to gain 20 pounds of fluid, and about 10 days to take off the 20 pounds when he was given the anti-inflammatory medications. Patient was released on December 11th. The first night home was bad! Back pain and confusion. He needed help into his PJ's and had to sleep in a recliner. Today patient has much improved, but still recovering. He is still on prednisone, but it is on a taper. Being decreased as the sed rate continues to decrease. In the hospital patient's sed rate was up over 130! It kept decreasing each week, and this week it tested at 28.

It was the manner in which this fast vaccine was manufactured, not like other vaccines that used an egg etc. This new MRNA (?) process which is a 20 plus year technology that was found not to be safe and it was thus shelved for over 20 years. Well when the new Omicron Variant began to hit, it was at the same time that I was having unexplained heart pressure and difficulty breathing. Did several tests at hospital but nothing conclusive enough to explain my heart and lung symptoms. I was seeing my various doctors on at least a weekly or twice a week basis. It was told to me by several doctors that the risk to me by the new variant was high when it came to how much more transmissible it was and therefor it was a high risk for me because if I got Covid it was likely that I would not survive it. SO. at the council of my primary care doctor and a friends Immunology/Infectious Disease doctor I decided it was a bigger risk to get Covid than it was to get the vaccine. I WAS WRONG. EVERYONE WAS WRONG. On December 7th I was administered the Maderna Covid Vaccine, it was to be my first injection. I had it done late in the afternoon in my upper right arm. I felt a small amount of pain in the injection site the next morning. I also experienced excessive tiredness. This troubled me but I did not think it important. I then began to get small red dots like measles all over my entire body. They continued to spread and I contacted my Primary Care Doctor who administered the Covid injection. She was concerned and because of my immune system disorder I was given an oral antibiotic once the dots began to coalesce and spread. I was given 300mg Clyndamycin 3 times per day. My skin was burning, itching, the pain was unbearable and just kept getting worse. At the same time I was still having the chest pressure and shortness of breath which I went into the hospital three times for, however they ignored my skin as a rash and gave no treatment options. I began to get worse and I became hypothermic, unable to hold my body temperature above 96'. It continued to get worse until I began to lose all the skin on my entire body, including my eyelids, rectum, groin, feet, hands, arms, torso, scalp, hands, ....everything. I was freezing cold yet I was sweating at the same time. My blood pressure began to drop and on the morning of December 18th I had a friend drive me past all the other hospitals and make the four hour journey to the Facility. I just arrive and got a hotel as I was told they had no rooms. However I was at the hotel less than 20 minutes when I was forced to have my friend call 911. I felt like I was going to die. An ambulance and fire engine arrived. Fire engine took my vitals then put me into the ambulance. I was taken to the Emergency room where several doctors looked at me and reviewed my stats. I was immediately admitted into the hospital after the doctor had a discussion as to whether I should be sent into downtown where there was a burn unit Hospital. However, since I had been a patient at the Hospital in 2017 they opted to admit me to the floor which was the kidney dialysis, liver and kidney transplant floor where much was known about the immune system,. I had an absolute excellent set of doctors who immediately began to stabilize me. My blood pressure had fallen to 95/50 with a pulse of 115. I felt so hot inside that I thought I would literally explode and my skin was in such pain that no pain medication was helping my suffering. I was immediately inserted with an IV which they used to hydrate me with saline drip etc. They also put me on Vancomycin Antibiotic IV twice per day for at least 5 days. Hospitalized for at least 8 days. I had so, so many tests ranging from several blood tests per day, to my stats hourly, to x-rays, to EKG's, to Covid tests, to ultrasound to many others that I cannot remember or was not familiar with.",,,Y,,Y,8,,Y,,12/07/2021,12/07/2021,0,,UNK,,"Losarten, Spironlactone, Hydromorphone,, myralax, clonazepam, pantoprazole, paroxetine, methadone, docusate sodium, Olive Oil, Vitamin D3, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Collagen,","Smoked 4 cigarettes per day, no drinking or other illicit drugs.","High Blood Pressure, Heart Disease, Erythrodermic Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis, LVH, Severe PTSD, Severe Anxiety Disorder, Panic Attacks, Mood Disorder related to chronic illness, and a list of other items as well.",,,2,12/29/2021,,,,"Prednisone, Monoclonal Antibodies, Penicillin, and a long list of others."

On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided).

The patient remarked that the vaccine had been administered in a more medial and superior location on her arm than usual. Since administration, the patient had aching, throbbing, and numbness of her hand as well as pain with shoulder movement. An oral steroid provided no relief. Physical exam of the right shoulder demonstrated tenderness over the bicipital grove. There was normal active/passive range of motion without effusion, crepitus, or deformity. Hawkins, Neer, and empty can tests were positive. Sonographic evaluation revealed a hypoechoic fluid collection in the region just lateral to the bicipital groove between the biceps tendon and the deltoid with a 2 mm hyperechoic foci consistent with a retained needle tip versus inflammatory synechiae. The patient was referred to orthopedic surgery. Surgical exploration revealed a ruptured biceps tendon that had healed to the anterior capsule resulting in mechanical impingement as well as subacromial bursitis. A tenotomy and bursectomy were performed to improve function and the patient was currently in physical therapy. The authors commented, ""Biceps tenosynovitis induced by inadvertent vaccine administration into the sheath of the biceps tendon. Proper administration of a vaccine calls for an intramuscular administration; the deltoid is a common target. Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) can result from tissue damage sustained from improper injection. Ultrasonographic evaluation can localize the afflicted area, in this case, the biceps tendon showed findings consistent with tenosynovitis. This allows for surgical referral in order to correct the underling deficit."" The authors concluded, ""Biceps tenosynovitis can result from improper administration of vaccine. Diagnosis can be made with ultrasonography prompting surgical referral if necessary. Given the largest ongoing vaccination campaign in human history, physiatrists should be aware of the differential diagnosis of shoulder pain post-vaccination.""",,,,,,,,,U,,,,"Test Name: Hawkins, Neer, and empty can tests; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:Hawkins, Neer, and empty can tests were positive,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Physical examination of the right shoulder; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:tenderness over the bicipital groove,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Sonographic evaluation; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:Hypoechoic fluid collection,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:) in the region just lateral to the bicipital groove between the biceps tendon and the deltoid",UNK,,,,,,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2021GS,2,12/30/2021,,Y,,
