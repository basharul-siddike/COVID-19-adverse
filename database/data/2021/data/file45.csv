I also experienced irregular breathing. To be specific, I would take a very large breath, a very short breath, or miss a breath. This started as a series of one to three irregular breaths every five minutes or so. My breaths became more irregular in the next hour. While driving to my employers office about fifteen or twenty minutes after my shot, my right eye closed and I could not open it for about seven seconds. My breathing also became deep and the pace was not under my control. Once at the office I sat in my manager's office to be observed. I experienced more intense episodes of the above listed symptoms such as both eyes closing and the left one watering. The watering continued into the next day periodically. At least two times while my eyes closed I had to put my elbow on the desk and my hand on my head to make sure I didn't fall out of the chair. I also felt very uncomfortable causing me to moan.

Over the following two weeks, the bumps/itchiness worsened and spread across all of my body except at my hands, feet, face, and lower back. Nearing the end of the second week, as the conditions worsened my skin felt painful all over (like a very bad sun burn). Due to the discomfort, I was largely unable to sleep during this period and had difficulty focusing on work. At week one I started taking Benadryl and applying lotion on my skin. I informed my PCP as well as the clinic that administered the vaccine of my condition. The clinic said they could do nothing unless my condition was life threatening. My PCP advised that an itchy rash is a rare side effect of the vaccine but that it would get better typically within 8-12 days. He also advised on taking an additional over the counter antihistamine along with the Benadryl, which I did.  None of the antihistamines made the conditions better, they continued to worsen. I started taking Ibuprofen for the discomfort and pain. By the end of the second week, my rash became more painful especially at my chest, neck, and ears - the skin became quite red and looked a bit like a burn. At this point I did not believe I was having a safe reaction and reached out to my PCP and vaccine clinic once more.  I was not able to reach my PCP but did connect virtually with an online doctor who reviewed photos of my skin and prescribed a topical steroid. Doctor advised I see a specialist in person, with concern that taking an oral steroid might  mitigate the effects of the vaccine. I alerted the clinic that I would be seeing this specialist and they advised that I instead go to urgent care. The following day (4/6/21), I did both. Healthcare facility provided an oral steroid and did not think it would impact the vaccination. The Specialist did not want to prescribe a steroid in concern that it would mitigate the effects of the vaccine. He advised to endure the rash another 1-2 weeks. Later that night, I could not bare the pain and starting taking the oral steroid. Within 24 hours I started feeling some relief. I am on day three of six of the steroid and each day the pain, itching, and rash are getting better.

When I woke up in the middle of the night the room was spinning. I fell back asleep, but when I woke up in the morning the room was still spinning and stayed spinning all day. I was very, very dizzy and nauseous all day (3/18). I vomited twice and struggled to keep even water down. I slept on and off all day due to fatigue and anything I tried to do made me dizzy, so sleeping was about all I could do anyway. The next day (3/19) I woke up improved, not 100%, but better. Still dizzy at times, but not as intensely and I was able to eat and drink without vomiting or nausea. For the next couple of days (3/19-3/21) the dizziness came and went, but was overall much better than 3/18. On 3/22 I woke up feeling terrible again, very, very dizzy and unwell. I was slightly nauseous from the dizziness, but was able to keep water and food down. I did a virtual appointment with a doctor, who said I had vertigo. I've had vertigo only once in my life (in January 2021), and it wasn't anything as bad as this. By 3/23 I was so miserable, I couldn't walk without assistance since I was afraid I would fall. I went in to see a doctor in person,  confirmed the vertigo diagnosis and recommended physical therapy. I did physical therapy and they said I had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo both in my left canal and in my horizontal canal. I started to slowly improve, but was unable to work due to my inability to look at a computer screen that week (3/22-3/28). I was well enough to work for 5 hours a day the week of 3/29, but unable to drive as sudden head movements continued to cause dizziness. As of 4/4 I started driving again and am feeling mostly better, but I still have dizzy spells. Dizzy spells are short and manageable. I've been very fatigued (likely from the vertigo, but who knows) since receiving the vaccine. As of today (4/8), I'm still not feeling 100%.

ED course: Patient is a 17-year-old female who presents to the emergency room very anxious, she feels that she may be having an allergic reaction as she has a sensation of tightness of her throat. Patient did present tachycardic in the 130s oxygenating at room air at 100%. She had no chest pain or SOB. She was given Solu-Medrol, famotidine, and Benadryl with resolution of her symptoms. Patient's airway have been patent throughout. CBC and urine and urine drug screen are well, she was also hydrated. Patient did have improvement of her symptoms. Do not know exactly what was leading up to patient's symptoms but it sounds like she had her Covid vaccine on Wednesday, and then was given another vaccine today in the clinic.

The patient's co-worker had told us that her finger tips were numb and that she had a headache. The technician asked the customer to come back in, which she did and sat down in a chair immediately in front of me. I went directly to talk to her, as another technician was helping in the clinical services room, drawing up more shots.       I asked the patient how she was feeling, and what she was feeling.  She said she did not feel well, that her finger tips were numb, and she had this incredible pounding in the back of her head, and she ran her hand over the lower back part of her head and neck.  She looked down and I asked her again how she was doing, she said not well, that she was beginning to get light headed and was looking a little pale.  I called to the pharmacy team for help, to clear out the clinical services room and asked the technician to help me slowly walk her to the room.  As we got her in the room I asked her if she would be ok to lay down on the floor and put her feet up in a chair, briefly explaining that this would help with the dizziness and keep her safe should she faint, because she would already be on the floor. another technician popped in and asked her if she could get her a cold cloth for her forehead, Patient said yes and the technician did so. an employee was working at the computer and just quietly stayed working (for another store).  I moved around him and got the Blood Pressure Machine.  I asked the patient if it would be ok it I monitored her blood pressure, she said yes. Patient was always 100% coherent and helped move her arm for me. I asked the employee for a piece of paper to document the reading, but the technician ran and got me one.  Her first set of vitals were high.  I marked them down and the employee told me the time.  I just sat on my knees next to the patient for a while and tried to comfort her. I asked her a couple of times if she felt any change, and she said yes,     Shot given 2:40pm     2:45pm BP 149/99 Pulse 71   SX:  fingers numb, pounding in the back of her head  cool cloth placed on forehead  calmed area down & quietly talked to the patient to determine how she was doing  ************************************************  (Patient volunteered that she had just gotten tested for COVID-19 and that she tested negative.) I asked patient how she was feeling and she said that she was feeling a little worse.  She said she was starting to get the shakes.  I asked her if she had gotten anything to eat on her lunch and she said no. I asked her if she felt like it and if her BP was good, how would she like a sip of juice.      ********************************************     I asked the patient how she was feeling and she stated that her tight felt ever so slightly tight, but she said ""I am asthmatic, and it did not feel any different than what she had experienced before.   I took her BP/P again...  2:55pm BP 157/105 Pulse 68  I looked at the employee and he looked at me, and I told the patient that I would be right back.  I quickly went and consulted with the technician and we decided that we should call 911 due to the increased in BP, pulse lower and the change in symptoms.  The technician called 611 and talked to an employee and I called 911 and explained what was going on and what our need was.  (The technician and I quickly discussed that neither of us felt that she was having an allergic reaction, just an adverse reaction, Epi was not called for. ) Employee stated that the clinic recommended we give her Benadryl.  I did a fast check w/ the technician, it was not on our standing order/ protocol. Antihistamines can exacerbate asthma.) Then I went back to the patient.  By the time I had gotten off the phone with 911, 2 more employees were in the room, and the patient was just getting off the phone with her father.  Once I got positioned in the room, one employee left,  I asked one employee sit down in a chair and the other employee was by the door leading to the pharmacy.  I told the patient that we had called for an ambulance.  I briefly explained due to her BP/P and her symptoms changing.  I asked her if she wanted another cool cloth and she said yes.  I asked an employee to get one for her from the sink in the pharmacy.  I was again kneeling at her side.  I saw her eyes well up with tears and a few tears were running down her face.  I asked another employee to get me a paper towel, which he did, and I handed it to the patient.  I tried to reassure her that things would be ok and this was just to ensure that she was safe.

They asked the patient a lot of questions and I gave them my sheet of what I had recorded for her blood pressure and pulse (BP/P).  They asked the patient if they would help her into a sitting position, she said yes, but it was an awkward position, so I asked the patient if it would be ok if I helped support her back, she said yes, and I did just that.  I stayed with the patient until they got her situated on the gurney and I helped cover up her legs.  I went back to work when the EMT's wheeled the patient away.     The BP/P is the best of my recollection, as the EMT's took my sheet of paper.     At no time did the patient ever exhibit difficulty breathing, labored breathing or any change in her breathing.

Approximately one minute after receiving his vaccine, he had a syncopal episode falling directly backwards striking his head on the floor.  I, MD did not directly witness the fall, but everyone who witnessed the fall said that he fell completely unimpeded to the floor.  I was notified and immediately assisted the patient who was with his girlfriend.  Patient initially appeared ?out?, but almost immediately opened his eyes and asked what happened.  His skin was cool and clammy.  A pulse oximeter was placed on his finger registering 98% o2 and a pulse of 53.  I kept him lying on the floor until he was completely awake and aware of his surroundings.  At the time he said his neck was not sore, but his head was sore.  Approximately 2-3 minutes later, we were able to assist him in standing to immediately sit down in a wheelchair.  He was taken to the cot in the hallway just outside the Medical Observation where I was able to help him to stand and then lie down.  An icepack was provided to put on the back of his head, he was provided water, Gatorade, and two cookies.  Patient said that he hadn?t eaten all day and had been feeling slightly hungry prior to his vaccination.  I had patient move all extremities and asked his questions to verify that he was full awake and oriented to person, place, and time.  Patient girlfriend  stayed with patient while he ate his cookies.  I addressed my concerns about patient striking his head on the floor and the possibility of a closed head injury.  Girlfriend felt that patient was now completely back to his normal state of mind.  I had patient remain lying down for 20 minutes.  When I returned to check on him, he was sitting up and wanted to leave.  I told him that he needed to be able to walk up and down the hallway before I would feel comfortable letting him leave.  He stood up and walked halfway down the hallway before saying he was lightheaded.  I immediately went to him to lead him back to the cot, but he insisted that he needed to use the bathroom to urinate.  Both girlfriend and I stood in the doorway to assist patient if he needed, but he was able to finish urinating, then returned and sat in the wheelchair.  I spoke to both Doctors via a phone call and had spoken to someone earlier.  After letting them know that patient did not want an ambulance called, but I was going to strongly recommend he go to the nearest ER before returning home, I returned to the patient.  Vital signs at 1:53 were Pulse Ox of 98%, pulse 78, and blood pressure sitting of 140/75.  Again, I strongly recommended that girlfriend drive him to an ED for an evaluation and possible cat scan.  Patient also now had some paracervical neck pain which I also said should be evaluated.  Patient and girlfriend both insisted they didn?t want an ambulance called and girlfriend felt comfortable taking patient out of the clinic.  Patient said he was hungry, and they were going to get food first.  Girlfriend gave me her phone number (xxx)xxx-xxxx and I gave her my phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx).  I told her I was going to call her every hour to check on patient and told her to call me at any time.  I recommended acetaminophen for the headache and other vaccine symptoms but no ibuprofen because of the possible head injury.  I recommended to immediately call an ambulance or go to an ED for nausea, worsening headache, confusion, or drowsiness.  Girlfriend is not to let patient sleep longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Patient was able to walk out of the clinic easily under his own power without any assistance.  He stated he was feeling much better.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/07/2021,04/07/2021,0,Head CT normal 4/7/21.

Saturday just hands were swollen. Same for Sunday, but a new symptom appeared. I went outside  around 2pm and after 10 minutes, my face felt like it was on fire. I came inside and it literally was red from the neck up. Also,  from my finger tips up to about where a tshirt would be on both arms, was red. I ran water on them and it took about 10 minutes to cool off. The next day, Monday March 22, I was having uncontrollable itching and redness -drove me crazy! Dr. gave me a steroid shot and told me to take Benadryl every 4 hours. I did this for the remainder of the week. On Friday, I was no better. I couldn't be outside at all! Dr gave me prednisone which I did 4 pills/4 days, 3 pills/3days, 2 pills/2 days, 1 pill/1 day. Still no better. I went to a dermatologist on Tuesday April6th.

Physician then reports that the patient's breathing sounded labored, and the patient was not conscious.  At that point Emergency department was called.  Physician removed the patients mask and was preparing to administer an EpiPen due to the labored breathing but then the patient regained consciousness.  The Emergency operator advised her to keep the patient on the ground until EMS arrived on scene.  Patient was conscious and okay on the ground.  EMS then came and took care of the patient.  It was deemed that the patient gets lightheaded when she gets bloodwork done usually and believes this may have been an anxiety event. She did not want to go to the hospital.

It is difficult to determine the cause of that error because it occurred more than 1 year ago. However, the subsequent doses could have been prevented by more education of resources. In summary a repeated dose (3rd dose) on 4/30/20 should not have been administered until 9/3/20 and was counted as invalid according to system due to not being 6 months from previous dose. Patient then came in for Hepatitis A on 4/7/21. This was administered (4th dose) due to previous doses being invalid and system forecaster recommending administration to complete series.  It was found that that our EMR care gaps section did not recommend administration on 4/7/21. ACIP recommendations state the following: ""If the first and second doses of hepatitis A vaccine were administered less than 6 months apart, the second dose is invalid and should be repeated 6 months after the invalid second dose (7). However, if this repeat dose (the third dose) is administered anytime 6 months or more after the first dose, the series can be considered complete."" In addition to needing to know extra resources, system forecaster should only be cautiously utilized unless it is updated to include ACIP recommendations.

But individuals should be warned about this possible dangerous reaction or adverse side effect, which in my case did not occur immediately after the 2nd Moderna dose.

A complete blood count (CBC) revealed a platelet count of 1000/uL. White blood cell count and hemoglobin were within normal limits. The patient was admitted to the general medicine service at which point Hematology was consulted. Review of the peripheral blood smear showed severe thrombocytopenia with rare large and giant platelets. Erythrocyte morphology was normal and there were no schistocytes or evidence of dysplasia. Isolated severe thrombocytopenia with giant platelets on the peripheral blood smear was thought to be consistent with ITP and Hematology recommended starting dexamethasone 40 mg daily with a plan to complete 4 days. The patient received 5 days of dexamethasone 40 mg daily between 15th September 20202 and 19th September 2020, and an extra dose was administered due to an order duplication. During this time his platelet count remained in the 0-1000/uL range. Given the lack of improvement in his platelet count and concern for risk of bleeding, he received IVIG 1 g/kg (total dose 75 g) on 21st September 2020. On 22nd September 2020 his platelet count had increased to 25000/uL, and he was discharged home on 23rd September 2020 with a platelet count of 30000/uL. On follow-up 29th September 2020 platelets had increased to 5900/uL and subsequently normalized at 268000/uL on 4th December 2020. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization. The author's commented, ""While ITP following zoster vaccine has not been previously described, the temporal relation between administration of the shingles vaccine with development of ITP about 2 weeks later does suggest causality, particularly without other obvious triggers. Thrombocytopenia has been described following infection with varicella zoster in children both during acute infection and as a post-infectious sequelae occurring days to weeks after symptom resolution. The mechanism is thought to be development of IgG and IgM directed against platelet surface glycoproteins which occurs in the setting of viremia. Shingrix recombinant zoster vaccine does not contain live virus but rather contains zoster glycoprotein E combined with adjuvant ASO1B to promote sustained immune response. It stands to reason that this vaccine would induce a similar immune response as is seen in varicella zoster infection and may therefore induce IgG and IgM directed against platelet surface glycoproteins resulting in acute ITP. The patient in this case achieved a complete remission of his acute ITP following treatment with dexamethasone and IVIG.""",,,,,Y,8,,,Y,09/01/2020,09/01/2020,0,"Test Date: 20200915; Test Name: peripheral blood smear; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200915; Test Name: hemoglobin; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:within normal limits,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200915; Test Name: Physical examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 202009; Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:0-1000,Unit:/uL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200915; Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1000,Unit:/uL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200922; Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:25000,Unit:/uL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200923; Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:30000,Unit:/uL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200929; Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:59000,Unit:/uL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20201204; Test Name: platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:268000,Unit:/uL,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200915; Test Name: Erythrocyte morphology; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 20200915; Test Name: White blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:within normal limits,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Comments: Physical exam revealed several 5 mm purpuric blisters inside his mouth and on the inside upper lip, as well as small purpura at the site of an adhesive bandage on his left upper arm, and petechiae on his bilateral lower extremities.

1182365,04/08/2021,PA,,,,U,,"Metabolic acidosis; Weakness; This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of metabolic acidosis in a adult patient who received Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis.   The subject's past medical history included allogenic stem cell transplantation.   On an unknown date, the patient received Shingrix (intramuscular) .5 ml. On an unknown date, less than a week after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced metabolic acidosis (serious criteria hospitalization) and weakness (serious criteria hospitalization). On an unknown date, the outcome of the metabolic acidosis and weakness were unknown.   The reporter considered the metabolic acidosis and weakness to be possibly related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Metabolic acidosis; Weakness, in a patient of unspecified age and gender, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a part of a single-center prospective observational cohort study that was conducted between December of 2018 and June of 2020 to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, including any effects on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurrence or exacerbation given the presence of an adjuvant. The patient was more than or equal to 18-year-old at the time of allogenic HCT. The patient was between 9 to 24 months from time to transplant and was deemed appropriate for RZV by treating clinician. The patient did not have disease relapse prior to administration of the first dose of RZV vaccination (V1). No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received 1 intramuscular dose (0.5 mL) of Shingrix (administration site unspecified, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported. [In this study, Cohort A consisted of patients who received V1 at 9 to 12 months after transplant in accordance with a hospital vaccination guidelines. Cohort B consisted of patients who received V1 at 12 to 24 months after transplant as part of a ""catch-up"" vaccination effort. RZV was given alongside other vaccines in the vaccine schedule. Patients were followed until June of 2020 and for more than or equal to 30 days after final vaccination. The primary end points were safety and reactogenicity in the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all participants who received more than or equal to 1 vaccine dose. The secondary end points included incidence and severity of GVHD in the TVC compared with historical controls and the incidence rates of HZ in the TVC and modified TVC (mTVC), which included only patients who received both doses of the vaccine. Adult Post Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Vaccine Guidelines included: 9 months vaccine as DTaP, HiB, IPV, Prevnar, Shingrix; 12 months vaccine as DTaP, HiB, IPV, Prevnar, Menactra, Twinrix, Shingrix; 14 months vaccines as Hep B, Menactra; 18 months vaccines as DTaP, HiB, IPV, Prevnar, Twinrix and 24 months vaccines as MMR, Pneumovax]. On an unknown date, 3 days after vaccination (V1), the patient was hospitalized for metabolic acidosis and weakness. [In this study, HZ cases were defined as (1) a new rash that was characteristic (unilateral, dermatomal, painful, vesicular) and that was documented as HZ by a treating clinician or (2) an atypical rash or suspected disseminated VZV infection that was confirmed by VZV culture, direct fluorescent antibody detection, polymerase chain reaction, or immunohistochemical staining on tissue specimen. Patients who had HZ within 30 days of vaccine 2 (V2) were excluded from the mTVC analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed looking at follow-up only in individuals who discontinued antiviral prophylaxis. During the study period, there were 5 deaths; they were secondary to disease relapse and infection and were not considered related to vaccination]. The case was considered as serious due to hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. Outcome of the event was not reported. The events were considered as possibly related to vaccination. The authors commented ""Two doses of RZV demonstrated safety and tolerability in allogeneic HCT without increased rates of chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, or death, as well as overall low rates of breakthrough. Vaccines were co-administered with RZV in the majority of participants which may have led to a higher incidence of solicited AEs than if RZV was administered alone. Although there have been concerns related to potential immune-mediated disorders (pIMDs) with the use of the RZV novel adjuvant AS01B system, there was no increased incidence or severity of cGVHD observed in the subgroup that was vaccinated between 9 and 12 months compared with historical controls in the peri-vaccination 9 to 15-month period. This finding is in keeping with renal transplant recipients who did not experience higher rates of solid organ rejection21 and healthy adults who did not have increased pIMDs after RZV. Patients on immunosuppression during vaccination had a higher incidence rate ratios (IRR) of cGVHD in the peri-vaccination period compared with those not on immunosuppression; however, they also likely represent a cohort with a higher baseline risk for alloreactivity."". The authors concluded ""In summary, among recipients of allogeneic HCT, RZV was safe, tolerable, and did not increase rates of GVHD. There were few breakthrough cases of HZ in this cohort; however, future RCTs are needed to determine vaccine efficacy."".

Treatment included packed red blood cell (PRBC) and platelet transfusions, glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, diuretic for fluid overload, antihypertensives.  Outcome from the time of diagnosis: Recovered (2 week) with persistent hypertension.  The authors commented ""We have reported 3 children with SMA who developed TMA following onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy. These cases share several similarities. TMA developed approximately 1 week following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion, 2 of the 3 children suffered from vomiting, 2 of the 3 had previous exposure to nusinersen, and 2 had infections with encapsulated organisms. Patient 1 had an infection preceding TMA with a new infection shortly after infusion. Drug-induced TMA is theorized to result from immune-mediated reactions or a dose-/duration-dependent direct toxic effect. Differentiating criteria include early temporal association with drug administration in the former as opposed to a delayed onset from a cumulative exposure in the latter. Our 3 patients developed TMA approximately 1 week after administration, suggesting an immune-mediated etiology. Other causes and presentations of TMA include hemolytic uremic syndrome resulting from shiga toxin-positive E coli; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura resulting from a reduction of ADAMTS13, the protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF); hereditary deficiencies in regulation of coagulation or alternative complement pathways; and a wide variety of infectious pathogens, including encapsulated organisms. In addition to exposure to onasemnogene abeparvovec, each of the 3 patients had contributory factors that could be putatively associated with TMA. Potential triggering factors include concurrent infection with encapsulated bacteria and recent vaccine exposure. It is unknown what additional risks to onasemnogene abeparvovec, if any, previous exposure to nusinersen confers.

A 60-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 (Lot Number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported) as single dose; and dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 (lot Number: EL8982, expiry date not reported) as single dose; for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eye surgery (he already had surgery once) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 then on 29Jan2021 the 2nd dose. He experienced side effects: floaters on 06Jan2021, and streaks of lightening then vision loss on 15Mar2021. There was a large left horseshoe tear on the retina in the left and a detached retina on the left and a tear on the right retina on 19Mar2021. He already had surgery once. He will have 2nd surgery on the other eye. Reporter reported a follow up.  He can't see at all. He was recovering and has to lay on face for 2 weeks. Reporter stated she read about retina problems related to the virus but not to the vaccine, could not find information. Patient was a retail pharmacist. He deals with customers and several customers stated they had vision problems with the vaccine: double vision, loss of sight. ""There was a problem out there, but maybe they were not reporting it took reporter 2 hours to report so they may not have the time to sit there to report"". Reporter knew they can't prove it was the vaccine that caused it. Reporter don't believe in coincidences. It seemed quite obvious to them it's related to the vaccine. Reporter appreciated all the help and stated they didn't have all the answers.  Reporter sure it was the vaccine because it was within hours after the first vaccine, but since there was no information regarding the sight problems related to the vaccine patient didn't think about it. Then the floaters got worse and started to block his vision, after the 2nd vaccine it was dramatically; within hours it was worse. He's never been sick in 36 years (2021). Patient hoped no one else has to deal with what he has to deal with. Patient also reported that on 10Feb2021, patient had section of vision lost in the left eye. It was then reported that patient was well versed in the virus and the vaccine. He was unable to speak on the phone at this time as he was recovering from surgery. Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 6Jan2021 and right away began seeing hundreds of floaters. He didn't correlate it to the vaccine but it didn't go away. Then he received the second dose of the vaccine on 29Jan2021 and within hours he thought he was going blind. He went to an optometrist 01Feb2021 who sloughed off the idea of it being related to the vaccine and diagnosed him with Posterior Vitreous Detachment. It was previously reported to Pfizer when he got the diagnosis of the PVD and all the events mentioned were previously reported. Reporter stated that from that day on the floaters got larger; the around 15Mar2021 he noticed every time he bent over he saw streaks of lightning; and he started to have a black hole, a loss of about 20% of his field of vision in the left eye. He went to another local optometrist 19Mar2021, who saw a large horseshoe tear in on left retina; and a detached left retina. The local optometrist sent him to a specialist and who verified the tear and the detachment and said the other retina in the right eye also has a small tear. Patient then had eye surgery, Monday at 0700AM, 22Mar2021 by outpatient surgery, to drain the fluid in his eye; insert a gas bubble and a silicone band to repair the retina; and did laser surgery on the tear. The specialist advised that the surgery damages the lens so he will need the lens replaced in the future. Now her patient has to lay down with his face down for 23 hours a day for two weeks and take 6-8 weeks off work. He had a doctor's visit yesterday and the doctor seemed satisfied with his progress but he can't see out of the eye, everything was cloudy so he doesn't know if the floaters are gone or the eye sight is recovered yet. The doctor was planning to do the right eye tear repair on Thursday 25Mar2021. Reporter had searched online to see if other people have this, but she can't seem to get the stories online about problems with the retina and the vaccine. She wanted this to be known and documented. Reporter was asking if company have information about if other people have had this. As per reporter, the events were not serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events reported. The patient required physician's office visit for the events reported.

The patient didn't not know if she still has the eye swelling, she went back to her retina doctor on 19Apr2021. The retina doctor put her on eye drops after they found the eye swelling. The patient mentioned that she stopped the eye drops that she was taking after her surgery a week before she received the vaccine.

I began having pain two days after my vaccine, where it felt uncomfortable to wear underwear or tight pants, but it wasn't until the morning of the fourth day that I investigated the pain and saw the ulcer.  I went to a local urgent care in the afternoon of the fourth day, where the nurses took a surface swab of the ulcer, drew blood for an STD panel, and performed a Pap smear. I was given one week worth of valacyclovir, an antibiotic (which I do not remember the name of), and fluconazole to prevent a (or treat a possible) yeast infection.  I took one dose of valacyclovir the evening of the fourth day and the morning of the fifth day with no apparent improvement. I did not take any additional doses, as it was recommended by my provider that if it was not effective within 24 hours, then it may not be effective at all.  I took all doses of the antibiotic and fluconazole.  I began to see improvements (reduced pain, shrinking size) by the seventh day. The ulcer disappeared completely by the twelfth day.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/23/2021,02/26/2021,3,"RASH AT INJECTION SITE None.

A 71-year old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN5318), parenteral in the arm on 29Jan2021 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history included type 2 diabetes, heart attack on unspecified date in 2000 and shingles turned into neuropathy. The patient's concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX). Reporter was calling on concern of her/his father (patient) actually who still on ventilator (vent) due to your Pfizer's vaccine. So, he/she was told by the FDA to call directly Pfizer since it was a Pfizer vaccine that was given the first dose. He/she had already it reported it to their but he/she was not sure what all you need but he/she still pretty confident that it had a lot to do with vaccine that was given to him the first dose. At the time of this report he was on vent, he had been on for 40 days. He had the shot on 29Jan2021, his very first dose and then his very first symptom was on 05Feb2021. He also got a heart attack. I believe it was a triple bypass done back in 2000 but he did not have any heart damage. But he was on PLAVIX and he/she did not know all of his medication he was on. He/she had tried to look that up but he/she did not want to tell any other just in case he/she said that wrong, he/she honestly could not say what he was and wasn't taking at the time. He was taking the product, but he/she did not know the dose. He/she know for sure that he was on PLAVIX but did not know the dose. The other medication, no he/she would not have the names and dosage because he/she did not want to tell you because it was not, he/she did not truly know. About the start date of PLAVIX reporter stated he would have been started that probably in 2000 after his heart attack as far as he/she know but he/she could not confirm that. That was his/her rough guess as far as he/she know. As per dose reporter stated he she did not. About route of administration reporter stated, he/she could not give any information, on his dosages, his medications or anything because he/she did not want to give any false information. So, he/she did not have any of that exact information. He/she just know he was and he was on PLAVIX, that was the only one he/she know for sure, he/she did not know any dosage, he/she did know he was on other medication but he/she did not know any name or dosage so he/she did not want to give any false information. He also had shingles and also it had turned into neuropathy that was another thing he was dealing with at the time of the vaccine. As per lab data reporter stated his first symptom was around 05Feb2021 he was taken by ambulance on 10Feb2021 to the local hospital emergency room (ER), he was diagnosed with the flu and then later they called him in evening and said that it was COVID and by then he was staying home. The 11Feb2021 to the 13Feb2021, progressively getting worst, began to get a high fever, was unable to walk, uncontrolled bowel, etc. more of a flu (reported as flue) issue. And he was rest again by ambulance on 13Feb2021, he was taken to a bigger hospital. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 13Feb2021, he had a multiple lab done daily since then. He was on vent since then. He was put on the vent on 15Feb2021. When confirmed if it was after vaccine administration, reporter stated, after the vaccine, he got his first symptom 7 days after the vaccine. His vaccine was on 29Jan2021, his very first symptom which was very mild was on 05Feb2021. He progressively got worst and was admitted to the ICU on 13Feb2021 and then was intubation endotracheal (ET) tube on 15Feb2021. As per outcome of the event reporter stated he was still on the vent, he was, reporter would say improving since they told that probably never went to, he was actually going to die, they were pretty much planning a funeral. But he was now on a tracheostomy and he was walking up. So, they could say he was improving but he was still on a vent. As per hospitalization date reporter stated his very first day he went to the hospital would have been 10Feb2021 and that was when he was diagnosed with the flu and then later that evening after he was already home they called and said that his test came back positive for COVID also. But then he went back to the hospital by the ambulance again when he started not being able to walk or anything on 13Feb2021.

I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms.

In the past I have had angioedema and breathing issues but never severe enough to warrant going to hospital with several injections and from over the counter meds and prescription meds. So I was wary but decided to risk a jab. Straight up got tingling tongue and lips but after 15 min was just dizzy and roughly the same feeling. I am a slow up taker and excreter though. By the time I got home, about 20 min after the 15 min wait my neck on the injection side and swelled so much I no longer had a jaw and my eyes and cheeks were pretty puffy. Then the breathing issue started. I called the gp who said Tylenol, benedryl. Usually have them made because I have problems with additives but i don?t have any right now. So I used two ea kids chewable which allow me to have a dosage that works for me as I am sensitive to larger doses which can cause pvcs. Things were better but not good enough so took Zyrtec 10 ml/24 hr. If I had not had a similar experience with other injections this would have completely freaked me out. Thank goodness my quick treatment worked well enough that I felt confident worse was unlikely to happen, though the gp and allergist both wanted me to go to the er. Yesterday I did a repeat of Tylenol and benedryl in the morning and Zyrtec in the afternoon at two pm then Tylenol and benedryl again in the evening as I still had angioedema and felt tight in breathing. Repeat benedryl and Tylenol today but no Zyrtec as felt good enough to ride stationary bike a very slow Five miles.

1183140,04/08/2021,CA,62.0,62,,F,,"I got the vaccine at around 11am on 6th April.  By 8pm the same day I was experiencing very severe chills - I have never felt so cold before in my life,  and the evening was not cold..  The next day, 7th April,  I woke up with bad aches in various, seemingly random areas of my body:  both upper arms, outside parts of both thighs, center of back between shoulder blades.  Interestingly all the aches were symmetrical.  I had not done any serious exercise to cause these symptoms, just a stroll around the park after getting the vaccine. I also experienced crushing tiredness and had to go back to bed in the afternoon.  Today, 8th April at 5:30 pm my left arm at the vaccine site still aches, but all the other symptoms had vanished by the morning.  I'm 5' 4"" and weigh 114lbs.  My husband got the vaccine at the same time and had no symptoms.  We are speculating that my smaller size may have contributed to my adverse reaction.  He is 5' 6"" and weighs 180lbs.  In spite of this discomfort I'm so relieved and pleased that we were able to get the vaccine.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the fever and weakness were unknown.   The reporter considered the fever and weakness to be possibly related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Fever; Weakness, in a patient of unspecified age and gender, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a part of a single-center prospective observational cohort study that was conducted between December of 2018 and June of 2020 to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, including any effects on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurrence or exacerbation given the presence of an adjuvant. The patient was more than or equal to 18-year-old at the time of allogenic HCT. The patient was between 9 to 24 months from time to transplant and was deemed appropriate for RZV by treating clinician. The patient did not have disease relapse prior to administration of the first dose of RZV vaccination(V1). No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received 1 intramuscular dose (0.5 mL) of Shingrix (administration site unspecified, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported. [In this study, Cohort A consisted of patients who received V1 at 9 to 12 months after transplant in accordance with a hospital vaccination guidelines. Cohort B consisted of patients who received V1 at 12 to 24 months after transplant as part of a ""catch-up"" vaccination effort. RZV was given alongside other vaccines in the vaccine schedule. Patients were followed until June of 2020 and for more than or equal to 30 days after final vaccination. The primary end points were safety and reactogenicity in the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all participants who received more than or equal to 1 vaccine dose. The secondary end points included incidence and severity of GVHD in the TVC compared with historical controls and the incidence rates of HZ in the TVC and modified TVC (mTVC), which included only patients who received both doses of the vaccine. Adult Post Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Vaccine Guidelines included: 9 months vaccine as DTaP, HiB, IPV, Prevnar, Shingrix; 12 months vaccine as DTaP, HiB, IPV, Prevnar, Menactra, Twinrix, Shingrix; 14 months vaccines as Hep B, Menactra; 18 months vaccines as DTaP, HiB, IPV, Prevnar, Twinrix and 24 months vaccines as MMR, Pneumovax]. On an unknown date, 3 days after vaccination (V1), the patient was hospitalized for fever and weakness. [In this study, HZ cases were defined as (1) a new rash that was characteristic (unilateral, dermatomal, painful, vesicular) and that was documented as HZ by a treating clinician or (2) an atypical rash or suspected disseminated VZV infection that was confirmed by VZV culture, direct fluorescent antibody detection, polymerase chain reaction, or immunohistochemical staining on tissue specimen. Patients who had HZ within 30 days of vaccine 2 (V2) were excluded from the mTVC analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed looking at follow-up only in individuals who discontinued antiviral prophylaxis. During the study period, there were 5 deaths; they were secondary to disease relapse and infection and were not considered related to vaccination]. The case was considered as serious due to hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. Outcome of the event was not reported. The events were considered as possibly related to vaccination. The authors commented ""Two doses of RZV demonstrated safety and tolerability in allogeneic HCT without increased rates of chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, or death, as well as overall low rates of breakthrough. Vaccines were co-administered with RZV in the majority of participants which may have led to a higher incidence of solicited AEs than if RZV was administered alone. Although there have been concerns related to potential immune-mediated disorders (pIMDs) with the use of the RZV novel adjuvant AS01B system, there was no increased incidence or severity of cGVHD observed in the subgroup that was vaccinated between 9 and 12 months compared with historical controls in the peri-vaccination 9 to 15-month period. This finding is in keeping with renal transplant recipients who did not experience higher rates of solid organ rejection21 and healthy adults who did not have increased pIMDs after RZV. Patients on immunosuppression during vaccination had a higher incidence rate ratios (IRR) of cGVHD in the peri-vaccination period compared with those not on immunosuppression; however, they also likely represent a cohort with a higher baseline risk for alloreactivity."". The authors concluded ""In summary, among recipients of allogeneic HCT, RZV was safe, tolerable, and did not increase rates of GVHD. There were few breakthrough cases of HZ in this cohort; however, future RCTs are needed to determine vaccine efficacy."".

I don?t know how there can?t be a connection. My pharmacy?s and two doctors told me the vaccine lowers your immune system so it makes sense you would be more susceptible to getting shingles.    One pharmacist said this: The common thing is to wait till it?s gone before second dose because there have been no studies done with patients with shingles and so they say wait till it?s gone just to be safe. If you have active shingles, do not get vaccinated 2nd dose until healed. Even if it is past the 42 days, it?s still fine to get the next shot.  Another pharmacist said this: As of 4/8/21, the CDC does not state specifically that you cannot get the shot tomorrow due to taking valacyclovir or due to active shingles infection.  In my personal opinion,  If it were me I would wait until off the Valacyclovir and the shingles has gone away just to be sure your immune system is at full force.

The patient ended up receiving a dose of Pfizer for their second dose rather than Moderna. Failure at multiple steps leading up to wrong vaccine given: 1. General Registration: Looked patient up on Moderna schedule, put gave Pfizer wristband (Purple) rather than Moderna wristband (Red). 2. At rover check in there is a question that asks if a patient has received a 1st vaccine dose and what type of vaccine it was. The volunteer selected ""Yes"" they patient had received the first dose and that it was Pfizer. 3. Registration checked patient in and the vaccine type was not confirmed and checked against the wristband color. 4. At the vaccine table there is a vaccine administer and someone else documenting. The patient gave their vaccine card to the documenter while the vaccine administer gave the vaccine. The vaccine was given before the documenter pulled up the patient and scrolled to the bottom to realize that Moderna was the only choice. For second doses, Epic only allows a second dose type that is the same as the first dose to avoid these situations. The student that administered the vaccine, should have been confirming the vaccine type on the vaccine card before administering the vaccine. To mitigate the risk of this issue occurring in the future, we have re educated staff/volunteers at all steps of the process. We are confident that if the vaccine administer was a more experience clinician, this would have been avoided; more experienced clinicians would know to confirm the patient/medication match the medication being given.

I have not had it since 2015 until I got vaccinated on 3/29/21 and began to develop BP symptoms on the evening of 4/6/21 (headache on right side of my head/temple, odd sensation on right side of my tongue, almost like I burned it on a hot beverage) but I didn't think anything of it. I went to sleep and then, on the morning of 4/7/21, I woke up feeling extremely fatigued, brain fogged, and weak. I didn't notice any of the BP symptoms until I went to brush my teeth and realized I had lost motor function in the right side of my mouth. I immediately made a telehealth appointment with an Urgent Care doctor in order to get an Rx of Prednisone. I began taking the Prednisone around 3pm on Wednesday, 4/7/21. I also have been taking vitamin B-12 and a Women's Multivitamin to help regenerate nerve function.  However, since starting the prednisone, my symptoms have continued to develop. Symptoms currently include: right side of my face is extremely swollen; I have lost mobility on the right side of my face, the right side of my tongue still feels numb; right eye tearing non-stop; some mild ear pain in right inner ear; slight pins-and-needles sensation in my fingers on my right hand; difficulty eating and drinking; still feeling fatigued.  I have recovered from BP twice before so I am not too worried about having it again. I just think the FDA needs to put out a warning to the public that there may be a correlation between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and Bell's Palsy recurrences.
