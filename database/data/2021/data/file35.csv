My doctor thinks it is bursitis and that the person who administered the vaccine did so in the wrong location-resulting in inflammation in the bursa of the shoulder. Additionally, we weren't seated to receive our vaccine. We received it standing up, and in my opinion, I think it is very hard to relax your arm doing that. It was an extremely quick shot-spot was cleaned, vaccine was administered, and line moved up.

After a video consult with my PCP it was recommended that I go to the hospital and get a CT scan to rule out a possible minor stroke. The CT scan was negative. The numbness became better after two weeks but has not subsided.  After consultation with the doctor in charge of the vaccine operation for the site it was decided that I go ahead and take the second shot but instead of the right arm I should take it in either the left arm or the left thigh. The second shot was administered in the left thigh. I experienced the typical symptoms on the second day - fever, chills and aches and pain but they went away towards the end of the second day.

About an hour later, I had intermittent ""flu like"" pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn't seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out.

Still no fever, pain or fatigue but had a lingering headache and a burning sensation on the rash. Saw my opthalmologist right away who diagnosed it as shingles and did a complete eye exam. Luckily no shingles in the eye as that can lead to glaucoma or even blindness in severe cases. I was prescribed Valtrex (1000 mg x 7 days) and prednisone (60 mg x 5 days) by my PCP. Hoping that I was still in the 72 hour window when the antiviral med is effective, I started on the meds immediately. Today is the third day of treatment and the blisters seem to be crusting away and healing faster. Luckily, no new blisters as of now. The prednisone caused my eye area to swell up further so I am gradually tapering off the dosage from 60 mg prescribed to 40-30-20 mg.  Keeping a watch for any complications such as ear pain or numbness in the face. Have a follow up appointment with ophthalmologist who will be dilating my eyes for further checks.

It was frightening to experience tightness in my chest and back muscles.  I never felt like my lungs were compromised, there was just a heaviness as the muscles seemed constricted.  I felt a slight rise in my heart rate and experienced a few palpitations mostly because I kept pondering how much worse my symptoms could get.  I was a little cold, so I decided to go to bed after drinking extra water (also a suggestion from the nurse).

Patient did not have recent respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, surgery, trauma, HIV, or constitutional symptoms.  The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unknown date, the patient was administered INN Flu Vaccine Seasonal [influenza virus vaccine polyvalent; dose, route of administration and anatomical location, batch number, and expiry date: not reported] for an unknown indication.   On an unknown date the patient presented with complaints of abdominal distention and tingling sensation of both hands and feet.   On the next days, two weeks after vaccination, the patient was admitted to a hospital.   After admission the initial physical examination was unremarkable for diminished motor strength in upper (3/5) and lower extremities (2/5) accompanied by areflexia.   On an unknown date, during hospitalization the patient's condition worsened with subsequent development of ataxia as well as generalized weakness.  Thirty-six hours after admission, the patient developed respiratory muscle weakness with worsening negative inspiratory force (NIF) and subsequent hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation.  On an unknown date, the patient underwent laboratory evaluation which was unremarkable and head computerised tomography (CT) scan which did not suggest acute intracranial event.   The patient also underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis which failed to reveal albuminocytologic dissociation or any acute infectious process and electromyography to evaluate for polyneuropathy revealed delayed distal latencies, decreased velocity, and absent F waves suggestive of an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy.  This case was recognized as Guillain-Barre syndrome, potential complication of influenza vaccine.   On an unknown date, the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) for 5 days, but he did not wean from mechanical ventilation, so tracheostomy was performed, along with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy due to dysphagia.   The patient also had two additional courses of IVIGs and one course of plasmapheresis were administered which led to weaning of mechanical ventilation and improvement of motor function.   On an unknown date the patient was discharged on physical rehabilitation and was recovering from the event.   Per company, the event of Guillain-Barre syndrome was assessed as serious due to the criterion of medical significance and hospitalisation.

Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on 03Feb2021 (lot number: EL9269) for Covid-19 immunization. In Mar2021, the patient stated that her eyes were puffy and swollen like she was extremely sick, and she had a slight headache and was real tired, however when she went to bed she tossed and turned. She says she woke up at 04:00AM scratching her neck and chest and under her breasts, but she was mostly clawing at her neck, it was an internal reaction, allergies, so she looked in the mirror to see if she had hives or a rash and only could detect red across her chest or stuff. She says it was unknown if this was because she was scratching stuff, she took her temperature and it was a half degree above normal, and she laid back down. She says after she got up with the itching that night, 2.5 hours later she had no welts or anything, it was internal itching like what she had experienced when she had eaten something with a form of iodine content in it, where it causes a red streaky itching underneath. She says on Thursday she got up and felt like she had been beat to death, and she went to work and it got worse as the day went on, she was more tired. She says by 11:00AM she was freezing to death so she checked her temperature and it was still just a half degree different, so she used a space heater. She says that at 03:15PM she had a nurse check her temperature and it was still 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and she was so cold when she came home she took her temperature by mouth and then it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit she was figuratively knocked on the ground. She says if there was a difference, she doesn't know. She says she went to bed freezing to death so she put flannels on. She says 2 hours later she had taken Tylenol since her temperature was up almost to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. She says yesterday evening her ear canals and lymph nodes in her throat hurt and she was aching. She says that she didn't experience a cough until today, she is congested a little, which is not abnormal for her because of her allergies. She says her temperature was better today. She says for the Tylenol she took 625mg yesterday morning at 08:30AM, she never took more because she was never running a fever and she is not one to pop pills. She says she didn't take another until 05:30PM-06:00PM because she had heard that she was going to have chills but not a fever so she thought that was what she was experiencing and it wasn't until she got home and used her mouth thermometer and her ears and throat were hurting that she thought she had better check it and it was 2.5 degrees above normal so she took more. She says that she gets allergy shots, and she was supposed to go today but she doesn't know if she should because she feels tired, her eyes are tired right now and glassy, and her knees are aching, and her right ear is stopped up. She says she doesn't think that she needs to deal with allergy shots while she feels this way now. She says she usually gets her allergy shot twice a week, and her allergist said to have a day separation so she got her dose on Monday of the allergy shot, then got her COVID shot on Wednesday and she doesn't want to do her second shot this week, she couldn't go in today, it clearly knocked her on the ground, she didn't know it was 04:00AM when she got up.

As the weeks progressed, the left axillary became pronounced and swollen, and by mid March, required ED visit---ultrasound was done and diagnosed with lymphadenitis, still no abscess seen. Another week goes by and now range of motion has definitely decreased---return to ED last night, 3/21 where I had to have 4cm x 2 cm abscess in the axillary incised and drained.  Most prominent region was to the most lateral region of my axillary area with pain that has been sharp and radiating. Cultures are pending. I am convinced, as a healthcare provider, that this is correlated to the vaccine series, both received in the left arm---it is known that women should not have a mammogram for months after the vaccine due to a lymphatic response---i had a response with an associated infection; this has never happened to me before, it is no coincidence---it is related to the vaccine in some regard.

I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn't working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist's office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I've never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I'm sorry if you didn't!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I'm going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can't take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that's if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I'm already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I'm sorry I didn't update.  I'm still dealing with hives, but they're getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I'm not sure what they're called (like I don't know if it's a PAC, PVT, but I do know I've had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I'm so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I've been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she's having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I'm passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the ""moderna arm.""  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it's coming back in full force!

(Same Literature article)  Abstract: On October 7, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant hemagglutinin quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) (Spodoptera frugiperda cell line; Flublok Quadrivalent) for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in individuals 18 years of age and older. Clinical trials did not reveal any major differences in adverse events or serious adverse events following Flublok Quadrivalent versus standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. To improve our understanding of the safety profile of this vaccine, we reviewed and summarized adverse event reports after Flublok Quadrivalent administration to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). Through June 30, 2020, VAERS received 849 reports after RIV4 vaccination. The vast majority (810; 95%) were nonserious. Among serious events, there were 10 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including 5 people who required mechanical ventilation and 2 people who died. Many allergic reactions were reported as non-serious, but required interventions to treat a life-threatening event, example: epinephrine, nebulizers, albuterol, glucocorticoids, and supplemental oxygen. Two people experienced a positive rechallenge (which are allergic reactions after repeated vaccination with RIV4), including a person who despite premedication with antihistamines developed respiratory difficulties, required epinephrine, and was transported to the emergency department. The occurrence of anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions in some individuals may reflect an underlying predisposition to atopy that may manifest itself after an exposure to any drug or vaccine and does not necessarily suggest that Flublok Quadrivalent is particularly allergenic. Post marketing safety surveillance will continue to be vital for understanding the benefits and risks of quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine.  This case involves a 84 year old male patient who experienced weakness/progressive generalized muscle weakness/neuromuscular weakness of unknown etiology (muscular weakness), respiratory failure/acute hypoxic respiratory failure (acute respiratory failure), recurrent aspiration (aspiration), recurrent mucus plugging (bronchial secretion retention), pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding (gastrointestinal haemorrhage), hypertension, atrial fibrillation, possibly GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome) and Eaton-Lambert syndrome (myasthenic syndrome) or myasthenia gravis, after he received INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE [FLUBLOK QIV].  Past medical treatment, vaccination family history and concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing coronary artery disease.   On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE [lot number, expiry date and other dosing details were not reported] via an unknown route at unknown administration site for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious weakness (muscular weakness) and respiratory failure (acute respiratory failure), 10 days following the administration of INFLUENZA QUADRIVALENT RECOMBINANT VACCINE. The patient was hospitalized for this event.  The hospital management included mechanical ventilation, intravenous immunoglobulin, and glucocorticoids as a corrective treatment to the patient.  It was reported that, patient's hospital course was complicated by pneumonia, hemorrhagic shock (shock haemorrhagic) due to gastrointestinal bleeding (gastrointestinal haemorrhage), hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The medical records state that he had neuromuscular weakness of unknown etiology, possibly GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), Eaton-Lambert syndrome (myasthenic syndrome) or myasthenia gravis. (unknown latency)  The inpatient death summary listed, acute hypoxic respiratory failure with recurrent mucus plugging (bronchial secretion retention) and recurrent aspiration (aspiration) in the setting of progressive generalized muscle weakness. (unknow latency)  The pneumonia, shock haemorrhagic, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, myasthenia gravis, aspiration, bronchial secretion retention and aspiration were assessed as medically significant.   Details of laboratory data not reported.  It was not reported if the patient received any additional corrective treatment before death.  At the time of reporting, event outcome for pneumonia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, shock haemorrhagic, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis was not reported at the time of reporting. The muscular weakness, acute respiratory failure, aspiration and bronchial secretion retention were the events which were listed in death summery hence outcome of these events was considered as Fatal.  At the time of reporting, date of death was not reported.   It was unknown if an autopsy was done also the cause of death was clearly reported.  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: This case involved a 84 year old male patient who presented with muscular weakness, acute respiratory failure, aspiration, bronchial secretion retention, pneumonia, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis after the administration of FLUBLOK QIV. Although time of onset is compatible for muscular weakness and acute respiratory failure, concurrently present Lambert Eaton Syndrome and gastrointestinal hemorrhage may indicate complications of existing comorbidities offering potential alternative etiology. At the time of reporting patient had ongoing coronary artery disease.  Muscular weakness, acute respiratory failure, aspiration and bronchial secretion retention were the events which listed in death summery. Moreover, information regarding previous vaccination/medical treatment and tolerance, concomitant medications, other additional underlying risk factors if any and their etiological factors, autopsy result and laboratory investigations results, would be needed for further assessment of the case.

Sinus pain and pressure, low fever, muscle aches, weakness. I was the same later that day, the and continued to have a low fever. By the next day those symptoms were gone, but I felt weak and very fatigued, chilled, and slept much of the day.

From about 2pm on each day after being vaccinated, my energy plummeted, and the extreme fatigue set in and I slept all afternoon each day and then all night, each day feeling okay in the mornings, then boom, extreme fatigue beginning around 2 pm. I have only experience this kind of fatigue once when I had the flu many years ago, and also last March when my doc thought I had Covid, sent me to the emergency room to be tested, but at that time, they were only testing people who had just returned from China. I want to stress, I am rarely ill, I am very active, and to date am on no medications except vitamins. But last March I was very ill for three weeks then about three more weeks were needed for recovery.  My symptoms from this second vaccination have subsided, but with a small amount of fatigue remaining in the afternoons. So, I wonder, from the studies coming out, that I may have indeed had Covid last March, and my immune reaction to the second vaccine was extremely strong.

March 5 I received my (Janssen) vaccine and suffered no side effects, not even swelling or discomfort at the injection site.  Piece of cake!  March 11 I took my regular injection of Humira.  Pain started in my ankles, wrists, elbows and knees, increasing through the evening.  I developed a sore throat, but there were no other signs of allergic reaction.  Pain increased, waking me through the night.  March 12 Discomfort has increased severely.  Can?t put weight on my right leg and the slightest movement of any part of my body causes searing pain, especially in right leg from mid-thigh to below the knee.  I can?t lift the leg on its own; have to move it using my hands.  Pain is a constant 10, and I?m crying like a baby.  My left foot shows gout-like symptoms with heat, swelling and pain at the base of the toes.  The entire foot is very tender to the touch.  Taking Norco every six hours and using a cane.  I?m not a wimp.  I spent 10 years in the military, have had two total knee replacements, a reconstructed ankle and fought breast cancer twice.    March 13 Pain has diminished, but is still localized in the ankles, knees, wrists and elbows.  Taking ibuprofen instead of Norco, drinking a lot of liquids and icing swollen foot.  The most intense discomfort evolved during the 24 hours following the Humira injection.  I?m not a clinician, but it seems that the Humira didn?t react well to the introduction of the vaccine.  It?s as if it was saying ?Sorry, this spot is already taken,? and decided to duke it out.  I?m a bit concerned about the next dose of Humira, but the vaccine has supposedly done its work within two weeks.",,,,,,,,,N,03/05/2021,03/11/2021,6,,SCH,,Humira .4ml/40 mg once every two weeks; alendronate sodium 35 mg once weekly.

About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient's spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient's MS lesions may have contributed to his ""cognitive event."" However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week's events (even preceding the ""cognitive event"").

However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.

The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.

The doses were labeled with an expiration date of 10 March 2021 at 0701.   Since starting the COVID-19 vaccine program, they always used the doses before they approached the expiration date.  This time, there were 16 vials of the Pfizer vaccine that had not been used and set to expire. The labeled expiration date and time were clearly present on the outside of the bag containing the doses.  On the morning of 10 March 2021, a pharmacist retrieved 1 vial at 0754 and 7 vials at 1138 from that allocation and provided them to nursing for the day?s administrations.  The pharmacy placed those doses in a new amber bag and did not label the bag with an expiration date and time.   The nursing team received the vials, diluted and drew up 20 doses that were administered to patients before 1230.    The charge nurse did not question the expiration date until after 20 patients had been vaccinated.  At that time she messaged the pharmacist to verify the expiration date.  The pharmacist indicated that the label did not state am or pm and misinterpreted the expiration time for the doses as 7:01 PM rather than 7:01 AM.  There was not a defined double check at the time of distribution from the pharmacy to nursing  The remaining 11 vials were quarantined.  The pharmacy manager contacted the manufacturer.  According to Pfizer it?s recommended to use the thawed vaccine within 120 hours, but can be used up to 144 hours.  The doses in question were administered before 125 hours after they were thawed.  The remaining expired vials will be wasted and appropriate notifications sent.  Assessment: Twenty patients received Pfizer COVID vaccine 5 hours passed the labeled expiration date and time.  While exceeding the manufacturer?s recommended beyond use dating, the doses were within the acceptable 144 hours post thaw period and still safe for patient administration.  There was misinterpretation of the labeled expiration time by the dispensing pharmacist, the container of COVID vaccine vials provided to nursing was not labeled with an expiration date or time, there was not a double check on hand off, the nursing team did not double check the expiration date/time before dilution or administration.

Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day.

Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient's dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU.

I was 268 lbs when I presented for the 1st dose of Moderna at the Robeson CRV.  Within 24 hours I was weak, cold, aching all over, and nauseous. The nausea moved over to lack of interest in food.     I've struggled with intense craving for food non-stop for 30 years.  The cravings are gone.  By my second shot in March I was down to around 260 lbs.  Twenty days after my second shot, I am down to 252lbs.  Food is more of a necessity now rather than a constant desire.  I believe the vaccine modulated insulin/ghrelin or crossed the blood brain barrier and modulated the incessant dopamine reward signaling in the mesolimbic DA pathway when I eat food.  I reach satiety easily now.  I also have diminished need for Ativan.  I use to drink close to a gallon of water a day.  Now I have no real interest.  I might drink a couple liters a day.  To put things in perspective, before Moderna, I could eat 2 foot long Subway sandwiches, 3-6 cookies, 2-4 32 oz of soda and chips to stop my hunger for 2-3 hours.  2-3 hours later I would feel extremely hungry with a growling stomach. I could then consume 2-3 double cheeseburgers, a 20 piece nugget, 2 parfaits, and a chocolate sundae.  After Moderna, now a half a Subway sandwich and maybe a cookie are enough to last for most of the day.  The desire for food has diminished to necessity to eat and lack of interest in eating, even when my stomach is empty.  If I have a soda or sparkling water, I might have 1 or 2 and stop.  Moderna flipped some hormonal switch in my body.  It's great.  Food went from being an insatiable desire to a basic necessity.

The nurse (I?ve forgotten her name - boomer aged, short gray hair) was standing when she administered the vaccine, and I remember making a note of the whole situation because it was the first time that a nurse did NOT say, ?Relax your arm.? I thought that was odd.  I felt nauseous and dizzy within 1-2 min., but after my 15 min. Waiting period was up, I was no longer feeling dizzy or nauseous so I left. Within 10 min.  I felt an ache in my arm, deep in the bone, and different then the regular shot-site pain.  This is a dull ache that is barely tolerable.  A few hours later, my shoulders and neck were experiencing very extreme, sharp pain, and I can barely move my arm, neck, and head.  It hurts to hold my head up straight.  This pain continues for another 2 days. It is a very intense, throbbing ache, and worse after a fitful night of rest, due to the constant pain in my left arm and neck.  48 hours later, still in intense pain and got a massage.  Helped briefly but pain returned within minutes.  On day 3, I got another more targeted massage on my shoulders and neck, with only a brief amount of time free from the pain.  Day 4, the pain is so intense and I can barely handle it. I make an appointment with a APRN. She does not mention SIRVA but prescribes 800mg of Ibuprofen every 4 hours as needed for pain, and Flexeril, a muscle relaxer. She also gave me a shot of Toradol for the pain.

I was taken to an observation room, and a my oxygen saturation was checked.  Because my tongue continued to swell, my chest felt tight, and breathing became shallow, I was injected with 50mg of Benadryl.  I asked for this instead of the Epi pen injection.   The constriction in my chest improved a bit and my tongue started to reduce in size.  I was very sleepy and had the shivers.  After a half hour of resting, I was driven home by family.  The next day I had terrible joint pain, fatigue and chills.  Breathing was fine, but I was easily exhausted by any exertion.  Starting the third day, I was at work teaching and noticed a rapid heart rate, increased chest tightness and extreme fatigue from talking or walking the stairs.  The fourth day I had to leave work early because of the lack of breath and fatigue.  I visited my family doctor who gave me Prednisone and a rescue inhaler, and I started taking the medication. The fifth day my symptoms were the same, but I sat at my desk and was able to do paperwork.  The sixth and seventh days I had to get a substitute for my job, as I did not have enough energy or breath to teach or walk the stairs at school.  I have been on vacation from work since Saturday, a full seven days after the vaccination, and continue to have extreme fatigue and chest tightness with any exertion.   Sunday night I went to the Emergency because I could not get a deep breath and felt like I was suffocating. My oxygen levels were high and my blood pressure good, but the muscles in my neck and chest were constricted making me gasp and choke on my spit.  I was given an albuterol treatment and an anti anxiety drug to help relax me so I could breath normally.
