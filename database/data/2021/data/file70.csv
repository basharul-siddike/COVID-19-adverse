The doctor at the Urgent Care noted I had high blood pressure and also noted that he didn't believe the balance issue was associated with the inner ear.

Called PCP @ 0900 and left message for nurse to return our call.  By 1 pm, with no return call, decided to go to Hospital ER.  The ER physician initially suspected I had experienced a stroke.  They took blood, performed a neuro exam, EKG, a head CT scan, and MRI.  None of these tests showed signs of a stroke.

When to call 911 or Proceed to the closest Emergency Department: If you are experiencing life threatening COVID-19 symptoms including but not limited to: high fever, trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, blueish lips or face.How to Improve Your Breathing with COVID-19               Try to spend as little time as possible flat on your back! The largest part of your lungs are in the back of your body. When you lay on your back this causes fluid to pool in those parts of your lungs making it harder to breathe. Laying in different positions or sitting up will allow all the different parts of your lung to expand properly. You may notice it is easier to breathe immediately or soon after changing positions.                One of the best positions for this is called 'prone position' which is laying face down on your belly. This position makes it easiest for the biggest parts of your lungs to expand easily. This is called 'proning' and the more time spent proning the happier your lungs will be. Laying on your sides or sitting up in a chair is also helpful for breathing and changing positions helps keep your skin healthy.   Tips to Help with Repositioning ? Try placing pillows under the chest, hips, and lower legs when lying face down ? Trying different arm and leg positions can assist with comfort  ? Eat your meals sitting up in a chair when possible ? When laying on your side, a pillow behind you will help you not to roll on your back if you fall asleep ? If a position is too uncomfortable move on to another; comfort and rest are important parts of recovery ? Switch positions in a rotation to help all the areas of your lungs expand        After Visit Summary (Printed 3/30/2021) Additional Documentation  Vitals: BP 158/83Important   (BP Location: Right arm, Patient Position: Sitting) Pulse 58Important   Temp 36.9 �C (98.5 �F) SpO2 95%  More Vitals",,,,,,,,,Y,03/10/2021,03/27/2021,17,Probable COVID-19 (Resolved)  Specimen information: Swab / Nares Added: 3/27/2021 by POCT COVID-19 Antigen (Collected 03/27/21) Onset date: 3/27/2021 Resolved: 4/10/2021 (Expired) Add: Rule-Out COVID-19 and Respiratory Viruses   Add: SARS-CoV-2 (related to COVID-19)   Add: Rule-Out SARS-CoV-2 (related to COVID-19)   Add: Probable COVID-19,PVT,,"aspirin tablet cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, 1,000 unit tablet irbesartan-hydroCHLOROthiazide (AVALIDE) 300-12.5 mg per tablet meclizine (ANTIVERT) 12.5 mg tablet metoprolol succinate XL (TOPROL-XL) 50 mg 24 hr tablet pravastatin (PRAVACHOL)",,Nervous Decreased hearing of both ears   Circulatory Benign hypertension   Digestive Benign neoplasm of colon Diverticulosis of colon   Musculoskeletal Generalized osteoarthritis of multiple sites Scoliosis   Endocrine/Metabolic Glucose intolerance (impaired glucose tolerance) Mixed hyperlipidemia   Other Erectile dysfunction Obesity (BMI 30.0-34.9) Ventral hernia Low HDL (under 40) Need for Tdap vaccination,,,2,05/19/2021,,,Y,PenicillinsOther (document details in comments) SimvastatinOther (document details in comments)

Patient states that over the past week she has been extremely weak, with nausea, diarrhea, but denies vomiting. She also reports that her appetite has decreased and noted that the symptoms has worsened and as a result she presented to the ED for further evaluation.Patient denies abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or chest pain.   Upon further evaluation and tests in the ED, she was noted to have severe sepsis as indicated by vital signs and chest x-ray imaging indicating groundglass pneumonia typical of COVID-19 infection. She also had COVID-19 swab which returned  positive result. Additionally, patient was noted to be hypoxia with SPO2 of 88% requiring oxygen supplementation.    Hospital Course patient was admitted to a Hospital due to shortness of breath, with fatigue and weakness, and was found to have severe sepsis with endorgan damage of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.  Imaging study showed no evidence of PE, but did show evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.   Pulmonary was consulted, she was started on remdesivir with Decadron.  She had an increase in oxygen requirement to the maximum of 10 L via specialty nasal cannula during the admission.  With the treatment of remdesivir and Decadron she had improvement in her hypoxia, and was ultimately weaned to room air by the time of discharge.   She underwent a desaturation study on the day of discharge and determined that she did not need any supplemental oxygen.  She completed her entire steroid and remdesivir course during the admission.  She had no evidence of superimposed bacterial pneumonia.   Her hospitalization was complicated by atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, that improved with metoprolol administration.  This was thought to be precipitated by her severe hypoxia with acute illness.  She was kept on metoprolol 25 mg twice daily on discharge, and will need to follow-up with her cardiologist at  Medical Center to determine if she can come off of this again.  She will continue to take her Xarelto as previously prescribed.

Called doctor and while on hold a lump developed in my throat and I felt so parched I could not drink enough water to help that lump in my throat.  As I could still breathe the doctor said go home and take Benadryl for the weekend.  I started a Benadryl regimen as soon as I got home one every 4 hours until I fell asleep.  The next morning I felt fatigued and the face numbness turned into this pressure headache mainly on the left side (that is still present at day 12).  The lump in my throat was gone and never returned. I took more benadryl that evening a couple times 4 hours apart.  Mainly fatigued and pressure headache with occasional nausea.  This continued until Monday.  I wasn't fatigued on Monday-Wednesday but I had minor chest aches which I had in the past due to costochondritis/scar tissue.  Thursday I felt much worse upon waking, like I was sick with the flu again. I continued about my day until 11am the chest aches/pains turned into the worst pain of my life (short of child birth).  I called 911 as we were driving to the hospital asking if it would be better for us to pull over as I wasn't sure I would make it to the hospital.  He said the time would probably be slower as they'd have to locate me so my husband took me.  The pain was a level 10, I felt the most immense pressure but due to having 4 children knew Lamaze breathing helped with the pain.  Tears rolling down my face and breathing Lamaze was the only thing keeping me from screaming with pain.  The ER ran a broad spectrum of tests and found nothing showing, but relayed how it was most likely the vaccine shot 2.  I had also read intense inflammation can follow the vaccine shots.  Which would make sense since my lungs do occasionally get inflamed.  Accompanied with all of this I am unable to walk, do chores and sometimes just while sitting I cannot catch my breath.  I will take slow deep breaths until I cant breathe again within 20-30 minutes.  This mornign while unloading the dishwasher I became winded!  I'm not a runner by any means, but I move daily, I take our daughter to swim team, run errands, do dishes, etc.  I am having to stop and take deep breaths to catch my breath again.

When I looked under their I saw 6 red bumps in a V-shape ....   the bumps appear almost like an insect sting,,,  bumps are about 3 to 5 millimeters across,  one of the bumps seems to have much smaller bumps clustered around it.  I assumed that perhaps it was an insect, or spider bite,  and hoped it would heal.

This  rash  appears  to be  in a  1.5"" diameter circular patch,  with a  cluster of very small  pink bumps.     -----   Again  the pain is intermittent and mostly when I accidentally rub my back on something,  or my shirt stretches across the rash area.    The pain can also be intense.....    so much so that at times  the  pain between the  bumps in my right armpit and the lower area of my right shoulder blade seem to be connected  and the pain stretches across an imaginary set of strings from one rash to the other.      I do work outdoors often,   and  in years past  have been stung or bitten by unknown insects, ants, or spiders,  but usually the pain and the redness subside or disappear within 24 to 48 hours.....   In this case the  armpit  bumps and the rash below my shoulder have NOT  subsided  in  color intensity or in size  ---  AND  the Pain intensity has lingered now  9 days in the Armpit area and  6 days under my Right Shoulder blade.       I have applied  Benydryl at night time to help lessen the itching ---  pain is caused when I move in certain ways to cause rubbing of the affected areas.   For  NOW,  since I do not see an improvement,   I will  seek  medical attention as soon as possible.

The largest part of your lungs are in the back of your body. When you lay on your back this causes fluid to pool in those parts of your lungs making it harder to breathe. Laying in different positions or sitting up will allow all the different parts of your lung to expand properly. You may notice it is easier to breathe immediately or soon after changing positions.                One of the best positions for this is called 'prone position' which is laying face down on your belly. This position makes it easiest for the biggest parts of your lungs to expand easily. This is called 'proning' and the more time spent proning the happier your lungs will be. Laying on your sides or sitting up in a chair is also helpful for breathing and changing positions helps keep your skin healthy.   Tips to Help with Repositioning ? Try placing pillows under the chest, hips, and lower legs when lying face down ? Trying different arm and leg positions can assist with comfort  ? Eat your meals sitting up in a chair when possible ? When laying on your side, a pillow behind you will help you not to roll on your back if you fall asleep ? If a position is too uncomfortable move on to another; comfort and rest are important parts of recovery ? Switch positions in a rotation to help all the areas of your lungs expand",,,,,,,,,Y,04/06/2021,04/09/2021,3,"04/09/21 2125  COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2,RNA Molecular Amplification)  Collected: 04/09/21 1621 | Final result | Specimen: Swab from Nares   COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Overall Result DetectedCritical",PVT,,aspirin (ECOTRIN LOW STRENGTH) 81 mg tablet metoprolol succinate XL (TOPROL-XL) 200 mg 24 hr tablet nitroglycerin (NITROSTAT) 0.4 mg SL tablet omeprazole (PriLOSEC) 40 mg capsule semaglutide (OZEMPIC) 1 mg/dose (2 mg/1.5 mL) pen injector si,,Nervous Peripheral neuropathy   Respiratory Obstructive sleep apnea Dyspnea on exertion Shortness of breath on exertion   Circulatory CAD in native artery HTN (hypertension) Presence of drug coated stent in left circumflex coronary artery   Digestive Gastroesophageal reflux disease Morbid obesity (CMS/HCC)   Genitourinary Other testicular hypofunction   Endocrine/Metabolic Hypercholesterolemia Well controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (CMS/HCC)   Immune Rheumatoid arthritis(714.0)   Other Male erectile disorder of organic origin Current use of aspirin Umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene Encounter for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening History of placement of stent in LAD coronary artery S/P right coronary artery (RCA) stent placement,,,2,05/19/2021,,Y,,"HeparinOther (document details in comments) AtorvastatinMyalgia / Muscle Pain, Other (document details in comments)"

On 3/24 he was found out to be having confusion, family called EMS.  They tried to debride patient on his feet and he collapsed for about 10 seconds.  He did mention that he usually get dizziness/lightheadedness upon standing from bed.  Although patient has a history of A. fib but remained rate controlled during hospital stay, we held his antihypertensives including HCTZ and ARBwhile continued his Eliquis.  I believe his syncope was likely due to dehydration with decreased oral intake in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 symptoms. Before discharge is blood pressure was rising so his ARB were restarted while decision regarding HCTZ will be made by primary care physician. In regard to his COVID-19 infection, initially was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen but his oxygen demand decreased rapidly and most of the time he remained room air, he was not showing any dyspnea, cough, fever or any other generalized symptoms of Covid 19 infection.

During the same visit I mentioned that her and I got the flu vaccine at the same time together and I had a reaction that evening like i never had before and I have gotten the flu vaccine as far back as I can remember. She mentioned that it was interesting that I said that as they had noticed an increase in patients calling stating some reactions.

My entire body hurt so bad I was in tears. I sat there and spoke to my husband on the phone and somehow got the strength to get the few things needed and head home. That evening my body aches continued to worsen to the point i was in constant tears over how horrible I felt.   I ended up calling out sick and having to take unplanned PTO 11/11, 11/12, and 11/13. I continued to not feel well until that following Monday 11/16. i knew you could be sore from the shot, but this was something I had never experienced before. I honestly thought I got the flu from the vaccine. I did mention it to both my PCP and my daughters pediatrician when we were dealing with her HSP and the flu shot impact came up in the discussion.  When my daughter's pediatrician told me the added 2 new flu strands and possibly modified the formula that year for 2020 it was scary.  Ever since then, I continue to have regular body aches and exhaustion. I already had some sleep disturbances, but not sure if related, but seems to have gotten worse.",,,,,,,,,,11/10/2020,11/10/2020,0,,PVT,,"Amour thyroid, adderall, spirinlactalone, lunesta",,thyroid,,,2,05/19/2021,,,,biaxin

The patient was scheduled for surgery on her face on Wednesday this week and the patient had a panic attack on an unspecified date in 2021 so the patient was brought to the emergency room. The patient's husband stated that this was because the patient was scheduled for a surgery for basal cell cancer removal, and that the patient's breast being so large, the patient was worried.

Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia (diagnosed in 1996), ongoing allergies from 1981, ongoing food allergies and chemical allergies, ongoing allergy to alcohol, ongoing hypothyroidism from 2012, ongoing pre-diabetic from 2012, Lyme disease for 11 years before being correctly diagnosed and treated, concussion in Sep2019, and post concussion syndrome in Sep2019. The patient previously took nalbuphine hydrochloride (NUBAIN) in 1981 and experienced anaphylaxis; and paracetamol (TYLENOL) and was very sensitive, had rash and high blood pressure. Within the first 15 to 20 minutes following the administration of the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, on 10Mar2021, the patient's face and ears got very red, flushed, and itchy. The patient reported that she is allergic to alcohol and thought maybe it was the glycol in the COVID-19 vaccine that caused the reaction. She reported that she has had glycol before and has never reacted quite like that. The flushing, redness, and itchiness of her face and ears subsided within an hour and were gone by 4 hours. Her allergist instructed her to take 2 Zyrtec before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. After her face and ears became flushed, red, and itchy, she ended up having a really bad headache that continued until the next day. Her headache was severe for about 12 hours and continued for a total of a day and a half.  She stated that her headache was more like a migraine during the 12 hours when it was severe. It felt like a migraine, but worse. On 10Mar2021, the patient reported that she experienced flu-like symptoms like being nauseous, had dizziness, achiness all over, and was not feeling well, her post-concussion syndrome was triggered and had more headaches, dizziness, nausea. She reported that things have been going awry in her body since she had the COVID-19 vaccine. She reported that the increase in headaches seemed to have improved, but the nausea and dizziness have in some ways improved and then some days it feels like ""here we go again"" when it hits. About a week after she received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, in Mar2021, the patient noticed a change in her urination. It wasn't severe or anything at that point, she just felt like she was not able to release the urine (urine retention). She thought to increase her intake to see if it would help her urinate and it didn't seem to help much. She received a prescription on 26Mar2021, and during that week, she noticed that she was having more issues with some burning during urination and was developing pelvic pain and pressure. The patient stated that the scent and color of her urine looked fine.  She reported that the frequency started to increase with not much urine coming out. When she finished her antibiotics about 7 days later, the urine retention had really improved and went away at the end of March. In the morning of 26Mar2021, when the patient woke up, she had blood in her urine and clots. The clots were about the size of a pea and a couple were about the size of a dime. The blood and blood clots in her urine were what made her go to the doctor. She reported she has never had blood in her urine that she remembers. She was put on Macrobid for 5 days. She reported that Macrobid wasn't relieving enough of her symptoms and her provider ended up adding a couple more days. The patient reported feeling more worn out in Mar2021, since she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This did not improve and some days it was worse. The patient did not have the energy level and stamina that she used to (Mar2021). She reported that whether it's combined with the retriggering of her post-concussion syndrome, it is significant for her life. She was also not eating well and had lost some weight (Mar2021). She reported that her appetite is improving but it is still not normal for her. She mentioned it was harder for her to want to eat something because of feeling nauseated.

About a week after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 31Mar2021, she noticed the feeling again of retaining the urine. She was not swollen or anything and immediately went with increased fluids. The urine retention was not as severe at that point. It really showed up and intensified quickly with groin pain, pelvic pain, abdominal pain, and some back pain. She woke up the next morning after being doubled over in pain the night before and there was so much blood in her urine that she couldn't see any urine. Her urine was the darkest burgundy and the color of the darkest wine. She did not have anything in her urine the night before when she was doubled over in pain. She was increasing fluids and even drinking Propel for the electrolytes to make sure she was not making things worse. She woke up around 5 AM and felt so sick to her stomach. She had nausea the night before, but she was really nauseated the morning that she discovered blood in her urine. She woke up with severe nausea last Friday, 30Apr2021. Her doctor performed a urine culture. The urine culture returned positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae with 50,000 to 100,000 CFU/mL on 30Apr2021.

She woke up in the morning of 01Apr2021 and her headache was gone. Following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, she had severe arm pain. It felt like she was walking around with someone constantly punching her. She was moving her arm all around trying to get it to stop hurting. She saw blood and blood clots in her urine for over 24 hours. The blood and clots were lessening over the 24-hour time period. She probably saw in a 2-hour period at least 60 clots about the size of a quarter to a half dollar. The pain was excruciating.

The caller's wife was worse than he was. His wife was not admitted to the hospital, she went to the hospital at the advice of her lung doctor to receive an infusion and was only at the hospital for 3 hours getting the infusion. At that point his wife was told she had to wait 90 days to receive her second Covid 19 vaccine. If she had no symptoms of the Covid 19 virus she would be able to get her second vaccine. Her 90 day time frame was up yesterday, 05May2021 and she received her second Covid 19 vaccine yesterday 05May2021. Caller reported the CDC and his wife's lung doctor and her primary care doctor all had different answers when it came to deciding when his wife could receive her second Covid 19 vaccine.

The caller's wife went into the hospital and received a plasma infusion and that took about 3 hours. That was at Hospital on 06Feb2021 at around 12:00PM.

So, the time went on and there  was no more mentioning of holding Methotrexate and getting the injection. Then later this year, she went and got dose number 1 and dose number 2 and then, she called her doctor and called everybody and she said what about her immunity and what's going on because there was a lot of information on the fact that people that were on immunosuppressive drugs may not have the immunity like the other people (further clarification unknown). She enquired what she could do. Last year, she was pulled off from her work, she was an RN  and she was taken off her work because of the fact that she was on Methotrexate and was asthmatic (history). So, for a year she was like on house arrest, she did not go anywhere, she was not excited to call her guest because she got out in the air to put gas in her car and when it came down to her rheumatologist, rheumatologist said that the patient was okay, but she was not happy with possibly okay.

Then patient thought that she was going to take herself ahead and take herself off the Methotrexate get herself the injection (Covid Vaccine) and then go back on it.  But she didn't go back on the Methotrexate because when she went off of it, she didn't have any of the symptoms that she had when she was first put on the Methotrexate (further clarification unknown).

The patient just made her own booster shot, her third shot. The patient just wanted to let you know that when she had her third shot, she could barely move her arm that she had the shot in, and it was unbelievable because when she was lifting it up it just really hurts. So, what happened was her first one, she had no side effects and second one, she had minimal side effects like somebody had hit you in the arm and her third one she got more because she knows does not have side effects like other covid vaccine.

Over the following week, the pain intensified until it was so excruciating that I was completely debilitated. I was prescribed a steroid anti inflammatory and muscle relaxants. The next day the pain included radiating leg pain and numbness down my calf and including several toes. The pain was unbearable and the doctor recommended I go to the emergency room, which I did. At the ER I was given 2 injections. One, a powerful pain killer, (dilaudid), and the other, an anti-inflammatory, (toradol).

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

Lungs: Moderate airspace opacities throughout the lung bases are similar to prior and consistent with Multilobar pneumonia consistent with the history. Liver: No hepatic masses. Gallbladder and bile ducts: Cholelithiasis. Pancreas: No ductal dilation. No masses. Spleen: No splenomegaly or focal lesions. Adrenal glands: No mass. Kidneys and ureters: 10 mm benign left renal cyst, no follow-up necessary. No renal masses or Hydronephrosis bilaterally. Stomach and bowel: Redemonstration of perforated proximal sigmoid diverticulitis. Small pneumoperitoneum is stable. Predominantly gas containing, 25 x 28 mm collection adjacent to the inflamed sigmoid colon similar to prior; a fistulous tract extends toward the midline containing gas and fluid, with suspected fistula to adjacent loops of small bowel. Moderate to severe descending and sigmoid diverticular burden. Minor right diverticular burden. No small bowel obstruction. A somewhat clumped appearance of small bowel in the right lower quadrant near the colon enteric fistula. Appendix: No evidence of appendicitis. Intraperitoneal space: Mesenteric edema around the small bowel, slightly increased, however no new mesenteric collection. There is no extravasation of enteric contrast into the collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon. Vasculature: Mild aortoiliac atherosclerosis. Lymph nodes: No significantly enlarged lymph nodes. Urinary bladder: Unremarkable as visualized. Reproductive: Unremarkable as visualized. Bones/joints: Degenerative changes in the spine. Multilevel disc space narrowing. Multilevel central canal and neuroforaminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. No acute fracture or subluxation. Soft tissues: Small fat-containing right inguinal hernia. Small fat-containing left inguinal hernia. Large ventral abdominal hernia containing gas, which has replaced the previous contents of fat and bowel loops. Volume increased compared to prior. IMPRESSION: 1. Redemonstration of perforated proximal sigmoid diverticulitis. Small pneumoperitoneum is stable. 2. Similar perisigmoid  collection; colon enteric fistula, probably at least subacute in duration. The perisigmoid collection is prominently gaseous and there is no frank abscess. 3. Suspected mild enteritis the small bowel loops or loops associated with the fistula. No obstruction. 4. Additional findings as described are similar to recent prior imaging. COMMENTS: Any incidental renal lesion less than 1 cm or classified as too small to characterize, or any incidental cystic renal lesion characterized as simple-appearing, is likely benign. No follow-up imaging is recommended for these lesions per consensus recommendations based on imaging criteria.

Active Problems: Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon. Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present COVID-19. Perforated viscus. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.",Y,05/01/2021,,,Y,6,,,,02/24/2021,03/19/2021,23,"04/05/21 1446  Respiratory virus detection panel, Collected: 04/05/21 1315 | Final result | Specimen: Swab from Nasopharynx, Adenovirus Not Detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae Not Detected Chlamydophila pneumoniae Not Detected Parainfluenza Not Detected COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Overall Result Detected Critical Enterovirus/Rhinovirus Not Detected, Coronavirus Not Detected Respiratory syncytial Virus Not Detected, Influenza A Not Detected Bordetella pertussis Not Detected Influenza B Not Detected Bordetella Parapertussis Not Detected, Metapneumovirus Not Detected, 03/19/21 1624  COVID-19/Flu/RSV PCR Asymptomatic screening for admission ,Collected: 03/19/21 1459 | Final result | Specimen: Swab from Nasopharynx, Influenza A Not Detected Respiratory syncytial Virus Not Detected, Influenza B Not Detected COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Overall Result Detected Critical.

Procedure: EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY CPT(R) Code:  49000 - PR EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY CELIOTOMY W/WO BIOPSY SPX Indications: The patient was referred from an outside hospital due to worsening respiratory status due to Covid pneumonia and associated pneumoperitoneum from a presumed distal descending colonic perforation.  On initial presentation the patient did not have a leukocytosis, lactic acidosis or significant abdominal pain however over the course of his time at Hospital he has developed with a leukocytosis and lactic acidosis.  This prompted a prolonged discussion regarding the need for surgery and the fact that intubation may mean a prolonged course of vent dependence. The patient agreed to proceed with surgery with full understanding of the risks and now  presents to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy possible bowel resection possible ostomy possible open abdomen. Pre-op Diagnosis Perforated viscus [R19.8], Post-op Diagnosis, Perforated viscus [R19.8] Surgeon(s): MD, Staff/Assistant(s): Circulator: RN, Relief Circulator: RN, Relief Scrub: RN, Scrub Person: RN, Resident: MD,  Anesthesia: General Procedure Details. Patient was brought to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The patient was then transferred to the operating table in the supine position with all extremities padded as appropriate. His abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline laparotomy incision was started at the umbilicus given his known reducible umbilical hernia.  Midline incision was then carried cranially and caudally to adequately expose the descending colon as it met the rectum. Initially on incision purulence was encountered. The Omentum was densely adhered to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.  Small bowel was also densely adhered to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and pelvis. Ligasure device was used to carefully retract the Omentum. The small bowel was able to be carefully freed from its adhesions in the left lower quadrant. There was significant feculent and purulent staining of the small bowel where it was adhered to the descending colon. The descending colon was then able to be partially freed from its peritoneal attachments and was transected excluded the perforation using the GIA stapler. The descending colon was then attempted to be brought up as a end colostomy however the dense attachments to the peritoneum prohibited this. Therefore attention was then turned to the transverse colon which was easily able to be brought up as a loop ostomy. Therefore a nickel size area of skin was chosen just right of the midline laparotomy to bring up a loop colostomy. Dissection was carried down to the fascia to permit 2 finger breaths.  In order to completely free up the loop colostomy, and had to be freed from its attachments to the Omentum and the anterior abdominal wall.  Once satisfied with the position of the transverse loop colostomy, ostomy bar was placed between the loops. We then turned our attention back to the midline laparotomy. A JP drain was placed into the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and secured with 3-0 Nylon suture. The midline laparotomy incision was closed with an 0 looped PDS suture. The skin was then with closed with staples. Our attention was then turned back to the loop ileostomy. The colon was sharply opened down to the mucosa. The mucosa was then flowered to the skin of the abdominal wall using interrupted 3-0 VICRYL sutures.  An ostomy appliance was then cut to size and the midline abdominal wall incision and ostomy appliance refitted on the abdomen. The patient was then taken to the SICU in stable condition, remaining intubated throughout. Findings: Perforated distal descending colon, Total IV Fluids: Per anesthesia report.

I asked him if he was diabetic, and he responded that he was, but he never feels this way and had eaten before coming in.  After talking a while longer, I was going to ask him if he'd like us to check his sugar, he asked me if we had a blood pressure cuff.  I said we did, but he wanted to use the machine in front of the store because he felt well enough to get up and wanted to walk.   I walked to the machine with him.  He sat and answered the many questions tapping on screen with no issues at all.  The confusion was not evident.  The maching reported 111/68 or very close, with a pulse of 48.  He said, ""that's the issue, my pulse is down.  I need to walk around."" I said he could stay back at the pharmacy where we could see him, or we could call someone for him.

I had some tiredness and started to not feel well the day of the 1st shot.  I received the 2nd shot on 5/1/2021.  I developed tiredness and light flu symptoms.  My right arm also hurt.  No big deal.  But the day or so afterwards, I developed vertigo that persisted for 5 plus days. (This was not dizziness or anything immediately after the shot.)  The vertigo for me is waking up and I am off kilter and feels like I have had a few beers.  The first day was not great but proceeded to get better.  I would usually have it worse in the morning and it would get better throughout the day.  I would feel less drunk,tipsy and less off kilter as time progressed.  I was able to see my ENT, Dr, on 5/20/21 though I am mostly recovered.  I think I am just predisposed to this and something in the vaccine triggered this response in my system.

The patient had not felt good for a few weeks and then in the last week before the reporting date he started to get symptoms.

The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis and he took Azathioprine during the past few years so he was unsure if his rash was related to his weak immune system or the COVID vaccine.  The patient had sent pictures of his left leg rash to his physician and they recommended him to see a dermatologist who diagnosed him with shingles after a biopsy and tests.

The hives were easily burst by scratching, releasing a clear fluid that scabbed over.  The itching was significant.  I treated it with calamine and OTC cortisone cream.  New hives appeared every day for approximately ten days, after which the hives began to recede and no new hives emerged.  After about 14 days the hives had mostly cleared up and the itchiness was mostly gone.  Note that I was on allergen desensitization treatment (drops under the tongue every day).  The day after the hives started I stopped the drops just in case that was the cause, but the hives did not get better, in fact they got worse the first few days.  I was very busy with work at the time, my allergist is an hour away, and my GP was scheduling months out, so I just thought I'd ride it out without bothering the doctor.  The condition persisted for about 10-14 days, after which everything cleared up and I have not had another outbreak since.  re: talking to dr - I had some odd tissue irritation at the site of where my tonsils used to be with the first shot, so I figured the hives were just my immune system kicking it up a notch.

1333821,05/20/2021,KS,48.0,48,,F,,"A few hours after vaccine, I had been sitting down at a table and I got up to walk and I stepped down on my right foot and it felt like someone kicked me in my lower left leg. Kind of in the shin, but in the inside of the shin. The ball that sticks out - four inches above that on the inside. Every time I took a step it felt like someone was kicking me with a metal toed sharp boot. I hobbled around that day and the next day I realized I couldn't move on it. The Urgent Care I was closest to that was open didn't do x-rays. So on Monday, I went to Urgent Care Center - could feel a little knot where the pain was. Pain lasted three and 1/2 days consistently and then that was it. I did keep it wrapped for two weeks like the doctor told me just in case. About 10 days after I had been to the Urgent Care, it happened on my left side - about four inches above the ankle bone on the inside of the shin, I had the same sensation of pain. So I used the wrap for that ankle. It wasn't as severe as the other side - it was about 30% pain - it felt like someone kicked me with a sneaker instead of a metal pointed boot. That lasted about a day and 1/2 (about 1/2 the time that the right side lasted). I had like something was biting my ankle  - it got to be inflamed - I never had a reaction to a mosquito bite like that - I thought I had scabies. I went to my doctor and he didn't know what it was. It wasn't scabies - just a violent, insane reaction to a mosquito bite - it was inflamed, red, bumpy and hard - on my right ankle and also on my left ankle - started small and got to be the size of a quarter.

By the time I was checked in the chest pain had subsided to be just a slight discomfort, overall the chest pain had lasted for approximately 2 hours. At the ER my bloodwork was done and the initial blood samples returned an elevated Troponin I level of 5.04 ng/ml. While at the ER at the  I experienced one more incident of chest pain which lasted roughly 30 minutes and was moderately low on the pain scale.

I was scheduled for a CT scan, cardiac MRI, and echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of Myocarditis. By Saturday afternoon I was taken off of the heparin drip and told that they would not be able to perform any of the scheduled tests until Monday at the earliest. My most recent troponin level came back as a 9. At this point I decided to check myself out of  against medical advice since they were not able to run the necessary scans and my wife and I do not live in .

The ulcers rapidly grew and were in full ""bloom"" about 36 hours from first noticing them.  There were 4 areas of ulcers: 2 of them on the interior of the vaginal wall near the opening that were about an inch in diameter/length and 2 other smaller patches on the exterior labia minora.  For the first several days there was also extreme swelling of the entire area.  During this time and in particular the first couple of days pain from the ulcers was extreme - the evening of April 25 I was completely unable to sleep.  On April 26 I went to see a gynecologist who diagnosed them as aphthous ulcers based on my history of having these before and tests I have had in the past to rule out other possible diagnoses (A biopsy to check for cancer, STD tests including swabbing the ulcer to test for herpes). She prescribed medication for pain management  (lidocaine jelly, a small amount of narcotic to help me get through the worst of it) and a Medrol pack in hopes it may help accelerate the healing time.  For the first 2.5 weeks urinating was extremely painful.

I am glad that I took the COVID-19 vaccine because I think it would be worse if this is a natural infection. It might be valuable if we can collect safety data for those who had GBS history,  so people know what to expect and they can be proactive if things happen.",,,,,,,,,U,05/06/2021,05/19/2021,13,I did the hearing test on May 20 2021 at hospital.

The patient has several skin grafts present on both arms, and stated that after receiving her second dose a large clear bubble presented on the outside of her skin.  She presented a photo of the skin and bubble.  While impossible to estimate accurately, it appeared to be a significant amount of clear fluid consistent with apparent leakage of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine potentially due to administration into skin grafts/scar tissue that has built up.  She asked whether or not she should receive a 3rd dose since she was not sure if she even got the second dose.   211 was called by myself and stated they could not provide an answer, and they transferred me to the Vaccine Direct Live line.  Vaccine direct stated that a definitive determination could not be made, and that the affected patient should consult with a primary care physician or the local health department.  They did advise that if a 3rd dose was clinically indicated, that we were permitted to register and administer the vaccine to the patient.   Information was relayed to the patient.  As a student, the patient was able to be seen by the student health clinic in order to make a determination as to the appropriateness of a 3rd dose.  The CDC guidance document for vaccine administration errors (updated 5/18/21) was consulted (Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/covid19-vaccine-errors-deviations.pdf).

I went to bed.  12 hours after injection I woke up in intense pain feeling very sick.  My entire body hurt on a scale of 10 out of 10.  My neck muscles especially were so tight that it was unbearable and beyond a 10 on pain scale.  I had a headache.  I felt very nauseous like I might vomit at any moment.  My breathing became shallow.  I had chills to the point that my teeth were chattering and I was shivering uncontrollably even though it was 76 degrees inside my home.  I considered calling an ambulance, but was hoping this would pass.  There we moments I felt I might die and I left my door unlocked so EMTs could get in as I was still on the verge of calling for help.  I was unable to sleep due to the intensity of pain.  I could not eat and drank very little.  Day 2 I was still in intense pain on a scale of 10 out of 10.  I had a fever for a short time on and off.  I did not eat for two days.  I was able to take naps for one hour at a time, but then would wake up to a crushing headache and intense neck pain.  The second night I was able to sleep, although I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.  I would go from being extremely cold to sweating heavily feeling hot.  I eventually became very hungry but was afraid to eat and was still nauseous.  On day 3, the pain scale of my symptoms went down from 10 to 6.  I felt much better.  I was able to eat and drink well.  Day 4 I was not in pain but was exhausted and depleted.  Day 5 I felt I was recovered.  Please note:  I normally have a high pain threshold and I run up mountains and am used to pain.  I also have always had flu shots with no bad symptoms.  I am pro-vaccine.

This report concerned a 62 year old female.  The patient's height and weight were not reported. The patient's concurrent conditions included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism and gastroesophageal reflux disease.  On an unspecified date, the patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number unknown), dose, vaccination date and site of administration not reported, for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date (37 days post vaccination), the patient experienced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), altered mental status, acute kidney injury, liver function test abnormal, and emesis, and was hospitalized (date unspecified).  It was reported by emergency medical services that the patient was found altered in her bathroom combative and covered in faeces. The patient was unable to converse or provide any history. The patient's family reported she was last seen normal around 21:00 hours on an unspecified date and around midnight they heard a loud sound upstairs and went up to find the patient's room covered in emesis, faeces on the floor and she had torn her room apart and ripped things off the walls. It was reported that before going upstairs for bed she was in her normal state of good health and had eaten dinner with her family. The patient appeared altered, unwell and was spontaneously moving all extremities. Physical examination revealed temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 154/131 mmHg, a pulse rate of 87 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 96% on room air. There were no signs of trauma; her pupils were 3 mm, equal and reactive. She had a full passive range of motion of her neck, normal heart sounds, tachypnoea with a few scattered wheezes, Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 and skin revealed scattered petechiae. Laboratory workup revealed the following abnormal results: elevated white blood cell count 19.25 k/mcL, absolute neutrophils 15.59 k/mcL, lactate 4 mmol/L, procalcitonin 13.21 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein 6.4 mg/dL. Low fibrinogen 120 mg/dL and platelets 29 k/mcL. Urinalysis revealed large haemoglobin and 11 - 25 red blood cells per high powered field. Other tests that included COVID-19 testing, drug screen, haptoglobin, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio were all normal. A complete metabolic was not able to be collected in the emergency department (ED) due to persistently haemolyzed specimens even from the central venous catheter. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain and cervical spine revealed no acute abnormalities. Chest and pelvis x-ray were normal.  The patient had an episode of emesis and there was a concern for aspiration. She was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). During admission, haematology, neurology and infectious disease were consulted. She was found in the ICU to have acute kidney injury with a blood urea nitrogen of 26 mg/dL and creatinine of 2.19 mg/dL (NR not provided). On an unspecified date, (day 1 of the hospital) haptoglobin became low at below 10 mg/dL. On hospital day 2, her platelet count was reported as ""11,000 k/uL"", blood urea (BUN) was 66 mg/dL and creatinine was 6 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests were abnormal with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 982 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 231 U/L. Her fibrinogen increased to 619 mg/dL, lactate hydrogenase was greater than 2500 U/L, and her high-sensitivity troponin was found to be 2408 ng/L. Haemoglobin had also dropped from 14 g/dL upon admission to 8.2 g/dL on day 2 of her hospitalisation (NR not provided for all). Her anti-platelet factor 4 test, double-stranded DNA antibody test, and ""complement component 3"" were normal. Direct coombs was negative and the patient was platelet factor 4 negative. ""Compliment component 4"" was slightly low at 12 mg/dL and ""ADAMTS13"" activity was less than 12%. Once in the medical ICU, plasma exchange and high dose steroids were initiated due to worsening platelets. When her haptoglobin and ""ADAMTS13"" results were abnormal, the diagnosis of TTP was confirmed. While hospitalized the patient required hemodialysis, packed red blood cells for anaemia, plasma exchange, and 10,000 mg of methylprednisolone daily. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcomes of the thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, liver function test abnormal, emesis and acute kidney injury were not reported.  This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender's Comments: V0:  This report from the literature describes a 62-year-old female who developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 37 days after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  She suddenly developed  emesis and severe mental status changes; physical examination was significant for a blood pressure of 154/31, tachypnea, and scattered petechiae. Initial laboratory evaluation was significant for a platelet count of 29 k/mcl, hemoglobinuria, a BUN of 26 mg/dl and creatinine of 2.19 mg/dl. Computerized tomography of the brain revealed no abnormalities.  She was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the intensive care unit. Follow-up labs included: haptoglobin low at 10 mg/dl, BUN 66 mg/dl, creatinine 6 mg/dl, elevated hepatic enzymes, anti-platelet factor 4  negative, and ADAMTS13 activity less than 12% (abnormal).  Based on the low haptoglobin and ADAMTS13 activity level, a diagnosis of TTP was made.  She underwent hemodialysis, plasma exchange, red blood cell transfusions, and daily methylprednisolone administration.  The outcome was not reported.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not a labeled event for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine; however, based on the temporal relationship of the events to vaccination, a relationship with the vaccine cannot be ruled out.

Around the middle of Feb2021, the patient had a hard time sleeping. She still napped during the day most days. Also around middle of Feb2021, the patient noticed muscle jerks, which came and went. It had gotten worse. The doctor said these were myoclonic jerks. The worst was on 28Mar2021. In the middle of the night, the patient called her on call doctor and asked if it might be a seizure. The physician said it was not a seizure. The weekend of 06Mar2021, the patient started to not feel well. She did not sleep well that Friday or Saturday night. She could not access her memory (short term memory loss) as of 07Mar2021, was flustered and it was clear that something was off as the day progressed. On 07Mar2021, the patient felt her skin hurt, like when you had a fever and the skin hurts. This came and went. Around 07Mar2021, the patient felt intense anxiety which branched out into other intense emotional reactions (big emotions, big anger). On an unspecified date, the patient had a sore inside the mouth. Around 07Mar2021, the patient felt freezing one minute and so hot the next. On 07Mar2021 at 03:00, the patient experienced a bad headache. It was like her neck and her back and her shoulders had intense pain, cramping pain and she had to soak in Epsom salt. The severe headache happened twice, lasted about 2-3 days, moved from the right side of the head, or top of the head. She stayed home from work on 08Mar2021 and 09Mar2021. The patient was exhausted and felt achy, like the flu. She had an appointment with the doctor on 15Mar2021. She was not feeling well at this point. The patient developed shingles (one spot on the right-hand side on back of head) sometime after 15Mar2021 and was diagnosed on 22Mar2021. The patient had an itchy scalp due to the shingles and claimed shingles caused memory issues and brain fog, since 07Mar2021, (it seemed like she got ""COVID brain""). The patient was prescribed Valacyclovir 1 mg oral tablet every 8 hours, 30 tablets, for the shingles on 22Mar2021. The open spot on the scalp crusted over by 01Apr2021 when the patient saw the physician again. The patient stated that shingles has lasting effects: brain fog, can't find the words, short-term memory problems have been coming and going since 07Mar2021, felt liked she has attention deficit disorder (ADD) on steroids, worked really hard to keep focus. This has worsened, maybe manifested more so in the last 3-4 weeks or so. Sometimes when she got anxious, her prefrontal cortex did not function well. After being diagnosed with shingles, the patient began to take propranolol 40 mg in Mar2021 as needed (patient takes 1/8 or part of 1/8 of a tablet, just biting off a tiny piece). Initially when she had shingles, she had ""some finger in the light socket, fight or flight internally""; the propranolol helped with this. She took it very regularly in Mar2021 and had taken once a week at most the last 2-3 weeks. The patient also took ""Brain Goo"" as of 22Mar2021 which caused the stinkiest gas in the universe, and the patient was bloated, (reported as from Feb2021) depending on what she ate, and because of that, the following week, the patient took an anti-gas pill, simethicone.  She had muscle cramps (in the left upper thigh on the inside of the leg and outside of the leg) and tightness, in Mar2021, that made it hard to walk. The other area that tended to cramp up and cause problems were the arches, mostly the left arch. She reported it was probably 24Apr2021, she came downstairs in the afternoon or early evening and had such an intense cramp like a Charlie Horse and fell to the floor. Muscle cramps come and go, they shift around, it's in the left arch. It's not intensely sharp like it was that day.  Right now, her left arch has a knot. The patient began taking tizanidine around 08Apr2021 at 4mg 1 tablet 3 times a day for muscle cramps and tightness, which can get painful, and tizanidine helps relax that. The patient experienced fatigue due to which the patient cannot go to the grocery store by herself very easily as she gets wiped out. The patient had to hang on to the cart because she does not have the energy. She described fatigue and stamina as she had energy for a while and then she crashed. She reported she had to carry protein with her because she can literally crash. She reported her left leg gave out and she had to grab onto the counter and she almost went to the floor. On 24Apr2021, the patient couldn't talk and could barely open her eyes. It felt like her body was shutting down. She couldn't get herself up off the couch to go to the bedroom. This had not happened again. She told her physician about it who was sending her to a neurologist. On 02May2021, her left hand knotted up- had a cramped muscle and tightness. The base of her thumb hurt (underneath the thumb where the thumb attaches to the hand). The patient felt that sound can hurt her ears, which came and went. The patient had a hard time seeing the computer screen, which started between 01Apr2021- 08Apr2021. The patient mentioned this to the physician. She was nearsighted and wore bifocals and will take her glasses off to see the screen better). Food tasted extra intense as of 15Apr2021. On 06May2021, the patient was exhausted after being on the phone so long yesterday. On 06May2021, the patient reported staring off into space ""like she could die and it wouldn't matter"" and it felt like her brain was cramped up (like her brain was going to shut down). Caller reported that she has been staring off into space steadily, and it was kind of scary. Caller reported that the staring off into space has not occurred again like the first time where she felt like her brain was cramped. Caller reported that she feels like the staring off into space was connected in the same part of her brain that caused her to not be able to talk or open her eyes on the night of 24Apr2021. The patient reported that the staring off into space had continued on and off but not to that degree of intensity. She reported that the first time she stared off into space, she felt like she couldn't interrupt or stop staring off into space. Caller reported that she doesn't know how she stopped starting off into space the first time, but now when she stared off into space she can move her eyes.

ER work-up concerning for severe sepsis with acute hypoxic respiratory failure for which he was admitted to the PCU under the hospitalist service.   Hospital Course He was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir but remained hypoxic requiring alternating trials of high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP for which pulmonology was consulted on 5/12.  Unfortunately, he did not tolerate prone positioning.  Despite his advanced age and several risk factors, he slowly but surely progressed from a pulmonary standpoint.  He was weaned off high flow oxygen 2 days ago and deemed stable for downgrade to MedSurg with telemetry at that time.  Since then he has continued to recover well, now requiring 6 L of oxygen with activity and 4 L at all other times.  He is anxious to be discharged home and appears medically stable to do so with home health care services, remote patient monitoring and outpatient pulmonology follow-up with PAL as prior to hospitalization.  Prior to discharge, all questions were answered and patient and his son expressed understanding, appreciation and agreement with the discharge plan at this time.

She responded that she is immunocompromised and wants to receive more than 2 doses.  She understands in other countries they are giving 3rd and 4th doses to patients similar to herself.

That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barr� syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring>quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.

She was to stay 30 minutes due to her immune issues, and she immediately felt like a ripple of a headache from the top of her forehead going all the way back and down her head.  She waited 25 minutes and went home.  She laid down and the headache never went pounding until the next morning.  She was weak and tired on Wednesday.  That night she saw the red infection around her left leg.  She was laying down and her hand dropped to her leg and at the top of her left thigh she looked at it and it looked like a wide ribbon that went all the way around the leg was pinkish red.  Then she went to sleep and when she woke up at 4:30 she almost fell.  She sat back on her bed as she was dizzy and from then on was dizzy upon sitting or standing and had to take her time.  She then couldn't turn to the left or right without spinning out and falling.   At the same time she was talking to people who stated that she was weird sounding and that she was not on the topic they were discussing, and she started calling her several times a day to check on her.   She had red eyes and conjunctivitis.  On Friday morning her friend came over to check on her and told her that she didn't look good and took her to the ER.  She could barely walk and took her to the ER and as she started to walk they told the ER that she needed a wheelchair and had to put her stuff on a conveyer belt and put her in a wheelchair.  He took her to the unit due to her adverse reaction to the vaccine.  She was still very dizzy after getting to the bed, and showed the infection on her leg.   It had blistered and it was starting to clear.  She was tested to see if she had a stroke and was in the ER for 4-5 hours, and the gave her no treatment, and determined that she was fatigued.  She was having a pain from her rib cage to her right hip that finally went away after 3-4 days.    She went home and was supposed to go feed some friends cows and horses and remembers slipping off the road to the right, and slowed down and then she went home and fed her cows and horses about 4 miles away and then let them back out of the barn.  She did some sweeping, and thought she could hear someone talking through a microphone audio and she could hear him say ""what is she doing"", and could only hear it in one spot.  She then continued cleaning and then saw the owner of the property coming at her with a woman and a horse and then saw him rubbing a horse and the woman was taking pictures.  She then found out that none of this happened and that she was having hallucinations.  This she found out by talking to the owner who said that  nothing that she thought happened did not.   She went home and was slipping off the road again and realized that she should not be driving on Friday after her ER visit.      On Monday she had the day off and realized that she had been hallucinating on Friday and was talking to her friends.  She went out Monday  night and had dinner with her and tracking her moves.  She was supposed to get the 2nd vaccine, and her friend told her that she should not have the 2nd one, and she was advised by her doctors not to get it.  She then went into the and informed them what happened and they took a report from her.   They told her that she was not hallucinating but lucid dreaming.     Following this she knew that she was okay and trying to figure out if she was hallucinating, and was back to somewhat normal by Tuesday.  She has lost completely of what happened yesterday and has to think about her actions and has to think carefully about what her actions are and that is slowly coming back.  She  used to have a good memory and since the vaccine has to catch what she is supposed to do and feels that this is not her usual and is going to a rehab center and ask for some assistance to get her brain back in gear.   She has to have alarms set to remind her of what she needs to do as she cannot remember what her next steps are.",,,,,,,,,N,03/24/2021,03/24/2021,0,,PUB,,Xanax.,None.,"Neuro auto-immunodeficiency, hypoglycemic.",,,2,05/21/2021,,,Y,"Penicillin's, most antibiotics, Codeine's and Hydrocodone's."

I believe that the shot caused an immune reaction, like it should, but also triggered an asthma attack that lasted several days but progressively reduced as time went on.

As of today (May 21), the shingles rash is blistering on my left forehead, eyelid, and scalp and is mildly painful, and I have a few swollen lymph nodes, but the shooting nerve headache comes back intermittently and is still very uncomfortable. I feel that this should be reported because if people could be more susceptible to shingles after the vaccine, there should be public information about this.

Please refer to separately reported ECG report from the same day regarding ECG and hemodynamic findings. PROTOCOL: Patient was injected with 24.7 mCi of Rubidium 82 at rest. Resting images were obtained concurrently. Patient received 0.4 mg Regadenoson after which 24.8 mCi of Rubidium 82 was administered. Repeat images were obtained concurrently. CT attenuation correction images were obtained for rest/stress perfusion interpretation, due to underlying subdiaphragmatic attenuation and uninterpretable for extracardiac structures.  RESULTS: Image quality was good. Images demonstrated normal LV size, and normal tracer uptake in the lungs. RV tracer uptake at stress was normal. Semiquantitative analysis: The scan results are normal and demonstrated no evidence of ischemia Transient ischemic dilation: No.  Gated PET: Demonstrated a post-stress LV ejection fraction of 74%, end-systolic volume (ESV) of 28 mL.  Quantitative HYPEREMIC Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF) and Myocardial Flow Reserve (MFR): Quality good Global MBF (mL/min/g)/MFR: 3.7/4.01 Explanation of values: - A global hyperemic MBF of more than 2 mL/min/g and MFR of more than 2 reliably exclude the presence of high-risk angiographic CAD (negative predictive value >95%) - A global MFR of less than 1.5 should be considered a high-risk feature on MPI PET and is associated with an increased likelihood for multivessel obstructive CAD or microvascular disease - A severe reduction in hyperemic MBF (<1.5 mL/min/g) or MFR (<1.5) in a single vascular territory in a patient with normal MPI PET results by semiquantitative visual analysis should raise the possibility of flow-limiting CAD. IMPRESSIONS: 1.  Negative PET/CT myocardial perfusion study for ischemia with normal global myocardial blood flow and myocardial flow reserve. 2. Normal left ventricular function (LVEF >55%). 3.

1337296,05/21/2021,IL,65.0,65,,F,,"On August 29th, 2019 I went to Dr. office for my two year physical for work. The Doctor completed his examination and then told me that I was due for a pneumonia injection. I hesitated and reminded him that I had a serious reaction to the flu shot in 2011 and that was added to my allergy list. He said that the pneumonia vaccine was completely different and I probably would not have a reaction from it.   As soon as I got home from work that night my right upper arm was swollen twice it?s size, very hot to the touch and red in color. I also had a temperature starting which was a little over 100�. I was feeling very ill and went straight to bed. I was sick and very uncomfortable all through the night. When I awoke the next morning on August 30th I called off work because I was so sick I couldn?t get out of bed. My fever had gone up to 102� and I lost use of my right arm. I had to put it in a sling in order to get any comfort. I had no feeling from my elbow up.  As soon as the doctors office opened at 8:00 AM that morning, I called Dr. office and talked to a nurse and told her what my symptoms were. She said that this is quite common for some elderly people to have reactions from certain vaccines and told me to take some ibuprofen and put ice on my upper arm. That was on a Friday and the doctors office was closed over the weekend because it was Labor Day weekend. I suffered all weekend not able to use my right arm and I am right handed. I called the doctors office once again on Tuesday morning, September 3rd. I had an in-service training day on that day but I couldn?t go in because I could not set up or conduct the training at all. I still could not use my right arm.   I talked to a nurse at the doctors office once again that day when they opened at 8 o?clock in the morning and told her that I was still having a very bad reaction. She reminded me to keep taking the ibuprofen and that Dr. did not have any openings until the end of the month but if I continued to react and it caused breathing problems to go to the emergency room. I did not have breathing problems but my arm continued to hurt and is still hurting to this day.  I still cannot lift my right arm above my shoulder without pain. My right shoulder hurts so bad and has been hurting for almost 2 years since the pneumonia injection. I want to scream at times when I have to take my tops or dresses off when I have to pull them off over my head. Sometimes if the neck opening is large enough I pull them down over my body. Many times I?m in tears getting dressed and undressed. I had to adjust my duties at work because I cannot lift children anymore onto the diaper changing station. I was a director at a childcare center and needed to work in different aged classrooms at times. It has interfered with my personal life at home. I can?t reach up to put my dishes away without having a lot of pain. I live on the second floor in my apartment building and carrying up groceries is so painful. I have never had any problems with my arms or shoulders until this pneumonia injection was given to me on August 29th, 2019.   Doctor ordered the MRI on my shoulder. He told me it was possible that I could have inflammation still from receiving that vaccination. I had the MRI on January 23rd, 2020. The reason I was so late getting the MRI was they didn?t have any appointments available until that date.  Because of my position at school, I was covering other classrooms which included very young children. I actually injured my knee twisting it while trying to place a baby down on the rug because I was losing grip with my right arm. So now I have a tear in my lateral meniscus and it has caused fluid to build up behind my kneecap with a cyst. That injury has caused me to be out of work permanently and it is still not better. If my right arm wouldn?t have been injured, I am sure I wouldn?t have lost grip of that child and my knee injury would not have happened.   After Dr. read the MRI results he suggested that I see an Orthopedic doctor ASAP, which I immediately made an appointment. I saw the Orthopedic doctor on Wednesday, January 29th  who?s name is Dr. and he told me that it was possible that the pneumonia injection could have caused the injury to my right shoulder. I actually saw Dr. on January 15 before the MRI. He recommended physical therapy for twice a week which I scheduled at that time.   Unfortunately my torn meniscus on my knee turned into a major situation causing blood clots and I have been in the hospital three times in the last 13 months. I had to stop my therapy for my shoulder and take care of my knee. Dr. did give me a Cortisone injection but it did not help it only lasted about three days and then it went back to hurting again. I have finally started back in March with Physical Therapy and it is improving somewhat if I am consistent. I have seen an orthopedic surgeon Dr., But they cannot do anything more for me because they cannot do surgery. I am on too much blood thinner I am taking Xarelto and Plavix for my lifetime. I do not want any more injections going into that arm. I had to take the Covid injection but they put it in my left arm.",,,,,,,,Y,N,08/29/2019,08/29/2019,0,X-rays and MRI,PVT,,"Methiphenidate 1, 20 mg ER daily Tramadol 50 mg as needed",None,Back issues Diverticulitis,Flu Vaccine,,2,05/21/2021,,,,Cipro  Erithromiacin

1337362,05/21/2021,CO,38.0,38,,F,,"I am a nurse practitioner, so as a healthcare worker, I received a very early vaccine. I have had little time to report what happened to me but not that it remains an issue I think I need to do so.  I had a very serious initial reaction and am now having chronic problems likely related to my vaccine. I received my first dose of Moderna 12/27/20 at POD lot# 025J20A and my second dose 1/24/21 at POD lot#029L20A.  After the first vaccine within a few hours I had significant injection site and arm pain. By the time I went to bed that night I could barely lift my arm over my head it was so stiff and warm. The arm was very painful, and I required Ibuprofen 800 mg TID for 3 days to control the pain. I did not have systemic symptoms from the first vaccine. After the second vaccine, within hours I had systemic symptoms of fatigue, generalized aches in my muscles and severe arm pain in the injection arm. I received the vaccine in the afternoon. I went to bed that night and woke up suddenly at 3 am, about 14 hours later. I had severe myalgias and rigors. I was barely able to move. I was not able to walk or perform fine or gross motor tasks without difficulty. I was unable to dress myself or get up to go to the bathroom. I required almost fulltime care from my husband for three days. On day 4 I developed severe headaches nausea and vomiting. The muscles still ached but I was able to walk and move again. My fine motor was still impaired for a total of 7 days. I was out of work for 8 days and did not feel 100% well for 12-14 days after the vaccine. As the symptoms started to resolve on day 5, I believe I had a mild case of Rhabdomyolysis as my urine was very dark almost brown and there was sediment in the toilet. There was no blood in my urine and no dysuria. I did a urine dip at work and it had protein and ketones but no bacteria. The specific gravity was very concentrated. I did not check my renal function at that time. My renal function a few weeks later was normal Cr 0.88. GFR 85. The dark urine and sediment lasted for about 2-3 days. I was drinking lots of water through this time-period and during then I was very ill. I was not seen at a hospital and rather I treated myself at home. During the above week was the first time I ever had neck or back pain. It did subside but I still had a dull aching in my neck after all of this. I had two episodes, one in late January and one in mid-February of left neck being very sensitive to touch, felt warm, and my ear was very hypersensitive to touch as well. It felt almost like shingles but there was never a rash and I took Acyclovir 800 mg TID for 3-5 days without relief. It subsided each time after about 7 days. This was on the same side of my body on the left as the vaccine was. In the end of March 2021 I began with left trapezoid pain in the same side of the body. I had some numbness in that arm as well so I saw orthopedics and received an MRI of my left brachial plexus which showed C3-4, C4-5, and C6-7 disc herniations that had not been present before. If the herniations were present in the past they were acutely inflamed by the inflammatory process the vaccine caused in my body. The MRI also showed significant and specifically left cervical and left axillary adenopathy this being the side of my vaccine. The pain spread beyond my trapezoid and become progressively worse into my neck and upper back only on the left side. The entire left side of my spine both cervical and thoracic was painful but the right side unaffected. It was very sharp nerve like pain shooting and running up into my head and anterior neck. Another MRI was done of the full cervical spine this time confirming these same herniations, but the discs appear to be pulling to the left with isolated left inflammatory process. The nerve pain became so severe that last week I began having numbness in that left arm and numbness into the left side of my face. A stat MRI of my brain only shows T2 flare pattern consistent with sequela of an inflammatory process of unknown origin. The foraminal stenosis at these spinal levels are very mild and do not explain my symptoms very well. Spine specialist reports that there can be symptoms of this nature but usually not with this mild of a pathology. The facial numbness has been identified as a trigeminal neuropathy of cervical origin but is rarely documented in medical journals and not seen by these spine specialists. There is a very significant amount of left sided nerve over stimulation, inflammation and adenopathy that is not explained. I have never had any spine or neck pain in my life before this and I have no history of traumatic events to explain this sudden change in my condition. I truly feel that ever since I received the Moderna vaccine and had that very severe reaction, my body has been in a constant inflammatory phase and there has been nerve pain in and around only the left upper side of my body where the vaccine was placed. I am scheduled on Monday for epidural spinal injections as I have been unable to find pain relief with any other therapies including dry needling, physical therapy, traction, tramadol, muscle relaxers, oral steroid bursts, etc. I know this may be a very strange and unique case, but I can say confidently that I believe the vaccine stimulated this entire cascade of events. If someone could please contact me related to this, I would appreciate it.",,,,,,,,Y,N,01/24/2021,01/24/2021,0,see above,PUB,,"Lamictal  300 mg daily Cymbalta 30 mg daily Zyrtec 10 mg daily Sinuglair 10 mg daily Vitamin D 3,000 iu daily Ambien 10 mg nightly PRN",None,Trigeminal neuralgia,,,2,05/21/2021,,Y,Y,None

1337868,05/21/2021,OR,33.0,33,,F,,"May 8: In the mid-afternoon I developed a blister on my right elbow at an outdoor gathering. It did not hurt. I thought I had perhaps been bitten by a bug. Once the blister burst it was moderately painful, and it has been slow to heal (I still have the scab). I don't think it's related (wrong side of the body, appeared before the back pain, etc.) but only mention it because it was similar in appearance to the first large blister on my left breast (except smaller, maybe 1/3 the size), and that is why I initially brushed off the blistering. May 12: I began having intermittent back pain between my left shoulder blade and my spine. I had fallen off our hammock the day before and attributed the back pain to that.  May 13: I woke up with a large (1.5"") blister on the left (outer) side of my left breast. I often sleep with a heating pad, and thought that I must have burned myself. However, I found it strange that it did not hurt at all. I thought perhaps I had touched a poisonous plant while gardening, and had then touched my breast putting my phone in my bra, or something. I even thought it was maybe a weird spider bite. None of these seemed to fit because the area didn't hurt.  May 14: the back pain continued intermittently and I took naproxen sodium to control the pain. The blister remained painless. May 15: It was hot that day (80 degrees) and we went to a local garden and did a lot of walking around. When I got home that night I had a slightly irritated patch of skin on my left side - right at the level of my bra strap and I assumed I had heat rash. The bumps were surprisingly tender, but not connected (stand alone little dots). My back pain had worsened - it was hard to pick up and hold my children, it was tender from the walk, and I kept on a strict schedule of naproxen sodium every 8 hours to try to control the pain. May 16: It was hot again and we went to a couple more local gardens and walked around. My back pain was pretty bad, but manageable when I wasn't carrying the kids. At the end of the day when I got home I saw that the ""heat rash"" had spread in a line under my left breast. It was now very tender to the touch, but felt fine if you left it alone. I was concerned that I had some sort of breast inflammation, and again, did not connect it to the back pain. May 17: My back pain was unmanageable, and I had to take several breaks from work to lie down. In the evening I discovered that the small dots on my left side were not pimples/ irritated skin, but rather tiny individual blisters. After looking into it more, I thought that I possibly had shingles since I had had chickenpox as a kid. May 18: My sleep was interrupted by the bad back pain, and I woke up several times. When I woke up the rash had spread to my sternum, and around my side onto my back. It was incredibly painful to the touch, and instead of being standalone dots there was now red inflammation connecting the blisters. My back pain was incredibly bad. I called and tried to get an appointment to see my doctor, but could not get scheduled until the morning of May 19. May 19: Did not sleep well due to pain. Doctor performed a visual exam of the inflammation and listened to the symptoms and diagnosed me with shingles with complications (the nerve pain). I had two pin prick red dots on my left wrist, and one itchy red bump on my left leg and I was concerned that it was spreading to other areas of my body. Prescribed the retroviral valacyclovir 1 g three times/ day for 7 days to try to reduce the length and severity of the illness, but advised that I had started treatment ""too late"" since I had not realized I had shingles and was past the 72 hour window so it may be less effective. Prescribed gabapentin 300 mg three times/ day for 7 days for nerve pain. Recommended using lidocaine and capsaicin cream 3 times/ day, too. I started treatment with all 4 of these right away. Dr. also advised me that she did not think the shingles were per se caused by the covid vaccine, but because it appeared in close proximity to my dose #2 (and I had side effects for several days indicating a strong immune response) that I should report it to the CDC just in case - which is why I am filing this report.  May 20: Rash on my back continued to spread all the way to my spine. Rash on chest worsened/ turned bright red. Back pain was extreme and not controlled by gabapentin. Pin pricks on wrist never turned itchy/ into blisters - I think they actually were heat rash from my watch. Bump on my left ankle appears to be a bug bite. I started getting periodic (every hour or two) sharp pains in my left ear, but no tinnitus. Periodic sharp pains in left side, left shoulder, and along my spine. Constant deep ache along my spine, and tenderness on my left side. Extremely fatigued. Taking gapapentin, valacyclovir 3x/day, and administers capzacin cream + a lidocane patch for areas of pain that do not have open wounds. May 21: For the first time the rash appears to be the same, or maybe even slightly improved from last night in terms of appearance. The back pain and skin tenderness is the same. Ear pain is more frequent - almost like I have an ear infection, with periodic sharp jabs multiple times an hour, but no tinnitus. Taking gapapentin, valacyclovir 3x/day, and administers capzacin cream + a lidocane patch for areas of pain that do not have open wounds.",,,,,,,,,N,05/02/2021,05/12/2021,10,"May 19: Visual exam/ medical history/ diagnosis, I have a follow-up appointment on May 24 to assess how well I'm responding to treatment, and potentially extend the valacyclovir, gabapentin, or both.",PHM,,"Prescriptions: Advair 250/50, montelukast 10 mg, Vyvanse 40 mg, ursodioL 250 mg, Levothyroxine 150 mg; OTC: multivitamin, Zyrtec, Flonase, Magnesium 400 mg, probiotic",None,"Asthma, obesity, hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, ADHD, gastric sleeve (surgery date: 12/07/20)",,,2,05/21/2021,,Y,,"Environmental allergies (indoor - dust, dog, cat).

I have tracked my periods on an app on my phone for years, and I have never been this late in my entire life. I am not exceedingly stressed, I am not strenuously exercising, I am not taking part in any sexual activity that would lead to pregnancy- I am not doing anything I can think of that would make my periods late.
