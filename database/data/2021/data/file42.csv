I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening.

I stayed in bed all day Sunday, 03-28-21   My bowels have been affected - off + on. (03-29-2021)  Because of the Emergency Care visits and test ,  my family dr. wanted me to come in. She was sort of dismissive about there being anything to do when on gets the covid-19 virus.           The Emergency Care Dr. (Privacy) went over symptoms, gave me 4 pages of information and had done the blood work, strep test because my throat seemed like it was blistering,  my chest hurt and with a lot of coughin.  for weeks,  he did a chest x-ray.  After 5 covid test and all coming back negative , the blood work showed I had had the virus but my antibodies due to my low immune system , tried to fight it off. The dr says I'll be one of the Long Haulers , so I do not know what symptoms  I'll have to come. I just feel tired and listless with all of this going on with my whole body system. Continues where I had gotten my inhaler filled (never had to ever use it after 10 years of allergy shots - everyone here seems to have allergies but over the years I have not been affected until after the 1st shot.)  I only heard a little wheezing at night at bedtime and sleep on 2 pillows for elevation and due to acid reflux.     My kidneys and bowels continue to be affected. The fibromyalgia 1 nervous system had affected both. Now, the kidneys go to much or not enough, and my bowles are constipation to much diarreah.     (3-30-21)  Woke up and just not feeling well all over. I am a optimistic person and do well in public or during this pandemic.  I always find much to do around the house, but it takes me days to do a single task.  I do crossword puzzles daily to keep mentally active.

Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting, she had a little infection and inflammatory markers come back positive. Concomitant medication included probiotics, vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) and vitamin d [vitamin d nos] (VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS]). The patient previously took flu for influenza immunisation and experienced peripheral swelling, tetanus vaccine for immunisation, amoxicillin, and experienced drug hypersensitivity, flagyl [metronidazole] and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient reported adverse events associated with her first Pfizer COVID vaccine shot. She experienced swelling in the upper breast area, swelling and pain in the neck, swelling in the armpits (for about 7 days) that got very itchy for 3-4 days but has since disappeared. She thought on whether to get the second shot of the vaccine considering these side effects since her doctor did not know why this was happening according to her. She thought she would report some side effects after one shot of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. It was strange. She did not read the symptoms until seven days out. Then she saw some have reported a lot less. After the shot, that night she had swelling in her upper chest. She thought it was lymph nodes in the breast and chest area on the side she got the shot. The next day her arm that she got the vaccine in got very large. Then, she does not know if it was related, two days later she had itching on both of her feet. It was the tops of her feet and only for a couple of days. She is not counting that. Day five after the shot has been the main problem. Her armpits started itching like crazy. It was severe itching and swelling in her armpits. The itching lasted for three to four days. The lymph nodes in her arm are still swollen. It was five days after the shot. It was both armpits. The night of the shot she had a lot of neck pain and she thought it was probably the lymph nodes in the back of her neck. That has lasted and was slowly diminishing. The patient was not planning on getting it. There was an agency that for assisted living for people that need help. They were giving it and had extra doses. This guy in charge at the assisted living house offered it to caller and caller's husband because her and her husband run a behavior health counseling. He offered it to them as healthcare professionals. He was given a batch for the residential agency but had extras. She was going through menopause or has been through menopause. She has hot flashes and has hormonal issues. The first week of December she started with a bizarre virus. She got tested for COVID and it was negative. It was not a rapid test it was a sendoff. Through that illness she had a whole lymph node response which was super unusual. The doctor said it was really strange. It was lymph nodes in her neck, arm pits, and groin. Every two days she would have lymph nodes reacting. She had recovered from that and was back to normal. Four days before she got the shot all of that had resolved. Prior to getting the vaccine she had been tested for Lymphoma and it was negative, and she had a little infection, and her white blood count was normal. She had inflammatory markers come back positive prior to getting the vaccine. She went to the doctor on 27Jan2021 and asked if she should get the shot. The doctor said to do it because if she got COVID it would be worse. She was going to have a follow up with doctor for the ongoing stuff and he might do more test. Never in the course of any of that did she have itching armpits or swelling that lasted all this time. She never had chest swelling. The shot in the arm and it moved across her chest. It was reported that, back in the 90's, in 1993 or 1994, flu shots caused her arm to swell really large and stayed swollen for three months. That was the last three flu shots she got in the 90's. Then the doctor said not to get them. No one said why. She doesn't have allergy to eggs or anything that she knows to cause that. She has gotten all other vaccines and tetanus within the last 10 years. Her arm would kind of react but not like that. It went away in a reasonable amount of time. She didn't get a fever. The patient does not have NDC, lot and expiry for flu shots, other vaccines or tetanus to provide. When her kids were younger, they all had to be vaccinated for rabies. She did not have any reaction at all with those vaccines. She has allergies to antibiotics. She does not have lot numbers, NDC, or expiry for the antibiotics she was allergic to.

She took another Benadryl at 04:00 on Sunday and she took one the previous night at 12 o'clock and the swelling has diminished a lot but it was not gone away all together. She was concerned because of 2 reasons, one she was due for another shot in a couple weeks and another reason was she wanted to know if it came from the vaccine. She clarified that the swelling was on her lips, mainly the left side pretty much of her lips. It started with the bottom lip and it was kind of so now that it was the top and bottom, it was both lips on the left side. She gave a lot of thought to this and that night she did have some frozen blueberries and bananas. She never ate blueberries on their own she usually puts them in oatmeal or something like that, so she thought maybe it could be the results of the blueberries since she has never had that.

I applied an ice pack to my neck and heat pad to the top of my head and rotated a third ice pack between my hands, under my jaw and in my armpit. It was the most severe body pain I?ve ever felt.

When I awoke on 2/11/21 I felt worse as the day went on until I had complete flu like symptoms.  On Friday, 2/12, I went to my primary care doctor and they did a COVID-19 test which was negative.  Hence, I just waited for the reaction to go away,  I was not better and able to resume normal activity until 2/15/21.

The ER doctor ran a CT scan with contrast and the result was a blood clot in my right lung and pneumonia in my left lung along with pleurisy. I was then admitted to Clinic on 3/4/2021.  I remained in the hospital until 3/7/2021.  There I was treated with IV antibiotics, warfarin, Lovenox (80mg), and pain medication for the pleurisy. I was also on a full time heart monitor and my heart was checked several times. Since returning home, I finished a dose of two antibiotics and am using an inhaler to help with breathing.

By Thursday April 1, 2021 it had gotten more sore and more painful to move and rotate my shoulder to get dressed, do my hair, hold my children and just do normal everyday activities.  Friday April 2, it got worse to where I did not even want to move it and could not reach my arm past my side to reach around and sleeping that night was horrible. Every time I would move the pain would radiate through the joint in my shoulder and I would have to try to brace it to move. I looked up shoulder pain after vaccine this morning April 3, 2021 and realized this was not normal. I also discussed my husbands reaction since he got his the day after mine. He said soreness at site but nothing in his actual shoulder and moving it.

Cat scan and labs done. Nothing odd was noted. Doc decided it was parethesia of left leg and nonintractable episodic headache event.

COVID vaccine manufacturer was Moderna. Given in the left deltoid, IM. Patient did stay an extra 30 minutes post vaccine b/c she has lots of allergies. About an hour After the vaccine she experienced pain in her left arm and up into her neck on the left side. Symptoms are very simulair to something that she ingested and had an allergic reaction to in the past. Felt okay the first day, second day (2-27-2021) she had chills, fatigue, aches and pains. Started to feel like she was improving on Monday around the 28th of February 2021. Fever was down.  Still felt fatigued. Nose felt like it was runnng, itching. Experienced dry eyes, started using the eye drops more frequently. Ear canals were itching. She noticed a tickle in her throat later. Not conscious of everything all the same time, she just didn't feel well overall. Vagina and anus were itching. Started to use the estradiol compound daily hoping that might help. Itchy all over and then realized that the reaction was sort of the same reaction she had in the past with the statin medication. Few days after that had abdominal bloating and cramping, also loose stool and finally diarrhea. Around that same time she reports that she was very dizzy and saw stars, had to sit down, did not actually faint. Denies any fainting episodes, but felt faint. Resolved after 5-10 minutes of sitting down, did not feel clear headed after that for several days. Did do her daily walk, starting on 2-28-2021, felt like she had less stamina.  Feels more tired in general still now. Does regret getting the COVID vaccine now. Took some benadryl at the time of the reaction and at hs PRN, benadryl makes her feel drowsy. Takes zyrtec, flonase daily and singulair. Pt's husband is a physician, and he prescribed a Medrol dose-pak, which did not seem to help. At the time was taking all of her prescribed medications amlodipine, benazepril. Has taken pepcid for heart burn in the past, was not taking it as the time.  Taking prn omeprazole. Denies experiencing any wheezing. Experienced Generalized swelling of eyelids, face, hands, feet. Tongue is kind of swollen today, and she feels like it has been swollen on and off since the vaccine. Prior to the vaccine she felt pretty good overall. Went out for a few days and went skiing with her family. Has a place out of town that she deep cleaned, felt like maybe she over did it, but she recovered after she rested briefly. Was due for the second vaccine last week. She held off until she could discuss with her doctor, and they discussed that she should not have any further doses. Physically she felt that she should not receive the 2nd vaccine. Continued  symptoms include itchy throat (tickle), vaginal and anal itching all day every day. Itching has become a little more like soreness of the tissues.  No bruising. Patient has not had the shingles vaccine (Shingrix), thinks she should not get it now. She has pretty much avoided getting vaccines throughout her life b/c she has had poor reactions to flu shots in the past as well.  One year, we tried a ""half-dose"" regimen of the flu shot, giving 0.5ml IM , waiting one month and repeating 0.5ml IM.  She did tolerate this well with no reported adverse outcome and did not get influenza that year though it was very active in the community.

Approximately 3 hours later, at about 3:10pm, I started seeing bright flashing arcs of light in my upper left vision.  I wondered if these were precursors of a migraine coming, but mine normally are crackles of primary colors in the center of my vision.  I remembered the vitreous detachment in my right eye 5 years ago.  This seemed similar, but not very similar.  Around 6pm I noticed a largish donut in my left eye vision, which I've never seen before.  About 7:30pm I called the consulting nurse, who told me to go to Urgent Care.  Got there about 8pm.  The MD thought it was a vitreous detachment, but wanted to get an OD on the phone. Additional floaters appeared in my left eye vision while I waited.  OD via phone thought it was a vitreous detachment and set up an appointment to see me on Mon. 3-15-2021.  Flashing arcs/donut/floaters continued through the next day.  Last flashing arcs were about noon on Mon. 3-15-2021.  In total the flashing arcs lasted about 45 hours.  5 years ago, in the right eye, flashing lights lasted only 5-10 minutes. On Mon. 3-15-2021 had eye exam. OD said posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).  Wanted second opinion about my retina.  Second OD performed exam, agreed on PVD and that my retina looked okay.

I went back 2 days later because I didn?t see an improvement.  They gave a medrol dose pack of steroids. Later that night it continued to get worse so I went into the ER.  Was treated there with solumedrol, and benedryl by IV.  Left that night but returned again to the ER the next day because of unbearable pain in stomach and violent throwing up that wouldn?t stop.  They treated me with pain medication, solumedrol, benedryl and epinephrine. On March 24th I was able to see the allergist Dr and he treated me with 2 antihistamines  and steroid.   3 days later I was worse so he saw me again and gave me injection of dexamethazone steroid shot.  That helped me get through the weekend. So by the next week he dropped to taking 6mg if dexamethazone and continuing this whole time with the antihistamine regimens he prescribed.

He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black ""coffee grounds-like"" fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE).

His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).

I went back to bed with ice. A few hours later, a family member called their doctor's office and was told yes, I could safely take triptan.

(Johansson ED, Nunez M. Acute Hepatitis B Surge: Opioid Epidemic Implication and Management Challenges. Open Forum Infectious Diseases 2020; 7(6):  .)  DOI:10.1093/ofid/ofaa190.  Concurrent medical conditions included hiv infection.   On an unknown date, the patient received Hepatitis B vaccine. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Hepatitis B vaccine, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant) and chronic hepatitis b (serious criteria GSK medically significant). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure and chronic hepatitis b were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure and chronic hepatitis b to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure, in a patient more than or equal to 19-year-old of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with Unspecified Hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.   The patient was a part of a retrospective study whose primary objective was to examine the number of patients with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection managed at a campus from 1st January 2015 to 31st December 2018, as well as their characteristics and serological and clinical outcomes. A secondary objective was to evaluate the diagnosis and treatment at the institution, based on national standards. No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient received unspecified Hepatitis B vaccination (administration site unspecified, dose number unknown; batch number not provided) upon diagnosis of HIV. The age at vaccination was not provided. [In this study, out of the 5 patients born after 1991, when the recommendation for universal HBV child vaccination was issued, only 1 confirmed having been vaccinated]. On an unspecified date 1st January 2015 to 31st December 2018, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was noted with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The patient had either jaundice or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels more than 100 IU/L without alternative explanation; either an acute illness with a discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (eg, fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) without alternative explanation or a documented negative HBsAg within the prior 6 months or a positive hepatitis B core (HBc) IgM antibody. The patient was diagnosed with acute Hepatitis B infection initially and later developed chronic HBV infection. [In this study, defined a case of acute hepatitis B with the following criteria: (1) a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and (2) either jaundice or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels more than 100 IU/L without alternative explanation and (3) either (a) an acute illness with a discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (eg, fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) without alternative explanation or (b) a documented negative HBsAg within the prior 6 months or (c) a positive hepatitis B core (HBc) IgM antibody. Outcome measures included clinical course, use of anti-HBV treatment, and progression to chronic infection, using the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria. A protracted-severe course was defined as either more than 4 weeks of an elevated INR (more than or equal to 1.5) or total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dL (or direct more than 1.5 mg/dL) or clinical evidence of encephalopathy or ascites. The lack of these criteria defined an uncomplicated course. Following AASLD guidelines, indications for anti-HBV treatment included protracted severe course, and acute liver failure was defined as an elevated INR (more than or equal to 1.5) with evidence of altered sensorium in a patient without preexisting cirrhosis. HBsAg positivity for at least 6 months after the initial HBsAg positive result defined chronic HBV infection. 36 cases of acute HBV were identified during the study period, 8 in 2015-2016 and 28 in 2017-2018. A history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) was identified in 8 patients, and all of these had acute hepatitis B in 2017 and 2018. Two patients reported vaccination against HBV several years before the infection. One of them was vaccinated upon diagnosis of HIV infection. More than half of patients did not follow up after diagnosis of acute HBV, and therefore their clearance status could not be determined. Seventeen patients had follow-up HBsAg testing, and 1 developed chronic HBV infection. This patient was co-infected with HIV, and his antiretroviral regimen included lamivudine as the only drug active against HBV. One patient with Crohn's disease, who was on treatment with mesalamine at the time of the infection, cleared the HBsAg by the 14th month after acute illness]. The case was considered as suspected vaccination failure being dosing schedule and time to onset unknown. The case was considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure. Treatment was unknown. Outcome was not reported. The authors commented ""Our data suggest that IVDU has contributed to an increase in acute hepatitis B cases in our community at least since 2017. This coincides with a national uptrend in drug abuse, an epidemic ongoing for more than a decade. In the HBV vaccination efforts, new ways of identifying individuals at high risk and additional venues to deliver the vaccine could be considered. On this regard, in our study one-third of the patients had used the hospital emergency room within the prior year, and more than half had psychiatric disease. Limited vaccine effectiveness constitutes another barrier in the fight against HBV. Thus, 2 of our patients became infected despite prior vaccination, 1 of whom was HIV-positive. As HIV infection is not only a well-recognized risk factor for poorer response to the HBV vaccine but also for developing chronic infection, including tenofovir as part of the HIV treatment can confer additional protection. The patient who developed chronic HBV was infected with HIV, an association that is well recognized, with an estimated risk up to 6 times higher than non-HIV hosts. Interestingly, we observed spontaneous HBsAg clearance after 6 months in 1 patient with Crohn's disease. Itis unclear if this delay was related to Crohn's in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy."".   The authors concluded ""In summary, our study confirms that the IVDU epidemic is implicated in the surge of HBV cases in our community, and it highlights the importance of additional efforts for vaccination targeting at-risk individuals at all possible levels of care. We identified opportunities to inform and prepare our health care providers while the opioid epidemic continues in order to better align the diagnosis and management of acute HBV with national guidelines"".

She says she has had headaches all last week, and she took Advil and Tylenol which sometimes helped. She says she finally saw her doctor last Friday on the 22nd because she felt that was a long time for her to have headaches as a result of a vaccine and her doctor had her do a CAT scan to be sure, since she is 76, to check if she might be having a stroke or something. She says she has continued to have headaches, though not as bad as last week, and she was reading the material they got at the hospital because they are supposed to have the second shot 06Feb2021. She says she would like to know, have they had people report having headaches that long. She says she took both Tylenol, clarified to being Equate brand Acetaminophen, and Advil. Equate brand Ibuprofen 200mg: She says she normally doesn't take Advil. Equate brand Acetaminophen: She says she has two bottles one of which she keeps in the bedroom, so she doesn't know which bottle her doses came from. She says both of the Equate brand Acetaminophen bottles are extra strength, 500mg. She says when she took these two medications she was careful not to overtake or take too much, but she can't really tell how much she took. She says she thinks she first took one Tylenol and one Advil, then later that night when it really bothered her, she thinks she took maybe two Advil's and one Tylenol, but she didn't write it down. She says now her headache is not nearly like it was last week. She says that she spoke to her doctor on Friday because she was starting to get concerned about it, but it was not unbearable all day long, she would wake up with it then take something, and during the day it was better, then at night it would be worse. She says this week it mainly bothered her that it was at the back of her head and neck area, since she does have problems sometimes with headaches at the back of her head after she had a car accident in 2009 where she got hit from behind that caused issues with her neck. She says she doesn't have sinus issues, so the headache behind her eyes was odd, and since the information said side effect, it is too big of a coincidence that she got the shot Saturday and she had a headache on Sunday. probably in 2009, and she started taking Amlodipine 5mg then, and then after she retired from teaching her doctor decided she didn't need it and she stopped taking it.

Medical history included A Fib, the patient had a light stroke in Apr a year ago, and she was put on another medication that did not agree with her. But caller has been on Eliquis for over a year now. Her eyes are so bad that she does not read a lot. She has allergies, and the 1 degree fever is normal with her allergies.

The patient stated she is 89 years old, received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She said she didn't read the Fact Sheet until last night and went through the list of side effects of the vaccine. She explained that on Friday and Saturday, her 'nose ran all day and night too' of a 'clear liquid'. She added she had a sore throat. She said she had no fever or chills but had a temperature at '98.3', which is a fever for [her]' because 'at 97 that's [her] normal'. She added she 'developed a dry cough, not an allergy cough like having mucus in [her] throat'. She pursued saying she 'doesn't know about the shortness of breath' and sometimes she 'feels a little tired' but isn't sure if it's related to the vaccine, due to her age. She said regarding headaches, she thinks it was 'not a bad headache' because '[she] remembers putting something on her head'. She added she 'had some congestions so [she] took an allergy pill'. She lastly described she had 'trouble sometimes with nausea' but did 'not vomit' and had no 'diarrhea'. She then said she is concerned with her 'clear runny nose' and her 'dry cough', which she also qualified as 'out of the ordinary'. She then mentioned that last night, her room was 'too cold' and therefore she had a 'scratchy throat and the sinuses came'; she said she took a sinus pill. She asked if it is normal to experience a 'clear runny nose' and 'dry cough' after the receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller asked if she should receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine after her reaction to the first dose. Caller explained that while having her symptoms she was exposed to her son who will get married ""on the 28th"". She expressed her concern on potentially being infected with COVID and its impact on her son. She asked if you can get COVID from the COVID-19 vaccine. She also asked if she should get tested for COVID given her experience. Caller had her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan2021. By Friday night, caller had a dry cough, was tired, had a little headache, and a runny nose. Caller is wondering if she had a light case of COVID but caller is hesitant to leave her home to go to the doctor's office for a test because of the cold weather. Caller had her first COVID vaccine on 28Jan2021 at pharmacy and caller stated that the Pharmacist said that she might gets chills and kind of like a fever, but caller did not get that. But, caller states that a couple of days after receiving the vaccine, caller looked at the facts sheet that had been given to her. Caller states that she didn't previously read the facts sheet, until last night, as her eyes are so bad that she does not read a lot. Caller states that she has had a 1 degree fever, but she has allergies, and the 1 degree fever is normal with her allergies. Caller states that her fever is 98.3, so it is not considered a fever really, but she normally runs 97 degrees. Then caller states that few nights ago, Friday night maybe, she got a dry cough, no mucus, just a dry cough, and she coughed for a couple hours but she was in bed, as it was nighttime. Caller states that she was also tired for a few days, as she is 89 years old. But caller states that she is in reasonably good health, and she lives alone and takes care of herself. So caller just had the tiredness and had a little headache, but she did not lose her taste or smell. Caller states that she had a sore throat, and some congestion, and her nose ran for two days. Caller states that her nose was running like clear water for two days, and then it just stopped. Caller states that it is cold and the weather is bad where she is, so she thinks her allergies are acting up again. Caller states that she is wondering if she had a light case of the virus and overcame it, or she is seeking advice about if it would be necessary for her to go out and get tested. Caller states that she can't tell if she got the virus or not, and she does not want to drive and go out in the cold to see her doctor. Caller states that a telehealth appointment is not possible because she got a new laptop but she does not like it, so the laptop is all wrapped up and set aside ready to be returned to (courier name). Caller states that she has two sons who could come over to help her with a telehealth appointment but she does not want them to get COVID, if that is what she has. Caller states that she is also concerned because her granddaughter is getting married on the 26th, and she does not want to give anyone COVID. Caller states that the symptom that really got her was that she had clear water running from her nose for two day and then just stopped, as the caller does not get this symptom with her allergies. Caller also has the sore throat. Caller is wondering if these could have been a side effect from the vaccine. But to be honest, caller thinks that what she has now, she is pretty sure is just her usual allergies. Caller states that she has just been staying home so that she would not get the virus, and so far so good. Caller just keeps herself busy around the house. Caller had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Caller states that she has A Fib, but she has not been to her doctor in over a year because of the Virus she has not gone out. But caller states that she has not felt bad or anything, she just has not kept up with her yearly visit. No Investigation Assessment.

Additional Information for Concomitant Products Lomotil, cholesterol and one for blood pressure: Reporter declined to provide any further information for medications such as when her mother began taking these medications, the dosages, or further information related to the medications. Reporter was calling for her mother. Her mother had her initial shot on the 8th, 08Feb2021, and she got up the next morning and was complaining of itching and had some areas of redness and bumps that went around the nape of her neck. She has small bumps around her neck, under her chin, on her chest area going down mid-line- from her chin- and then down under her breast. It itches and she didn't have that before. Clarified with caller that the shot being discussed is the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Reporter said areas of itching and bumps are still there today, she wanted to wait a little bit to see how it was going to be, but her mother still has it. Her mother does have a sensitivity to medications. You know, a lot of oral medications she can't really tolerate, it bothers her stomach. She's not really allergic to anything in particular- caller asked her mother, ""are you mom, no."" She just wanted to clarify that information.

The patient put something on that eliminated some of the bumps and every now and then the itching and scratching will feel like she's bleeding, but she is not bleeding anywhere. The bumps are still there. They are still red, the bumps are not red, they are an irritation. Conflicting information obtained in regard to bumps, unable to clarify or obtain further details due to the reporter not wanting to complete the safety report. Some areas of redness: Reporter says it is not really red, it is more off an off-color, pinkish. Reporter states that she can tell there's an irritation on the patient's skin from itching. Up all night: The patient was up last night 10Feb2021 when she went to bed. Reporter mentioned that her mother doesn't always relay information correctly. Company agent is unable to clarify if the inability to relay information correctly began prior to receiving the COVID vaccine or after due to the reporter not wanting to complete the safety report.

And I was scared to get this thing anyway, I already didn't want to get the shot and I did it.

But I guess what I am afraid of, in less than 3 weeks, I have got to take this vaccine again. The patient had the virus in November, and I did test positive at some point for the antibodies and when I looked up something, as I was running a high fever. I started looking up stuff and it said if you already have a pre-existing immunity which I did due to the antibodies. I believe it's still there because it has been 4 months, but you might get. It says you will get side effects worse; you will get side effects. People that have never got exposed and have antibodies, don't get the side effects but I got them. So, I guess what I am afraid of because now I am like, I know it's a reaction to the medicine. And now I got ulcers on my tongue. And my eye, yesterday it started with the stye thing, and I never get them, it was swollen. I know this was a reaction from that vaccine, I know it was. I don't have fever and none of that no more, the body aches have left me. It was pretty bad, but it left me. But I am scared to get that next vaccine. Consumer stated, my 'eye' also started getting kind of sore and now it's swollen and I know this was a reaction to that because my body did not like that's all I can tell you. I am afraid if I get the next vaccine which was on 02Apr2021 (later confirmed), am I going to get, I am scared that something worse is going to happen to me. Because everybody knows if you had the vaccine, any of them, nobody and they say with the first vaccine usually you don't get anything, it's the second one. Well, I know, it was going to happen to me, and it did happen to me. So, I am scared what's going to happen with the second one. If my body still has antibodies from the virus, it did say or I read, maybe it's not true but what I read, it said 89 or 87% people that have already been having pre-existing immunity which would be me because I had the antibodies, you won't get the side effects more than people that never had the antibodies or had the virus. I didn't have a taste because I was having a high fever initially when I had the virus. It was weird. I cannot explain the feeling. I was laying down that night, that Saturday night, I thought let me check my temperature and it was like 99.5 and then maybe an hour later 100 and at 1:30 in the morning, it was 101 and then a couple of hours later, I checked it and it was like down to 100.5. I was calling a Pharmacist when I started freaking out on that. And they said no, nothing was going to happen. On Sunday morning, it was 99.5 and then when I checked it yesterday, I had nothing, no more fever. But then I started with ulcer and I looked it online and it said that it could be due to the stress and I was very stressed out because of getting a shot. I didn't want to do it and I did it but one of the things, it said a sensitivity to foods and drugs can cause ulcers in the mouth and I know it was that and then my eye, I don't know about the eye, it's swollen underneath. I know this was a reaction, I know it was. Eye was a little worse. I guarantee you, it's due to the shot. Shot stressed my body. That was just my reaction to that shot because it started all the side effects. And then 3 days later, it started with an ulcer in eye. And I guess that it's just too coincidental. It just stressed my body bottom line. The eye was a little bit worse today. The ulcer was going to go away, but it is at its peak right now. I am worried about the eye. It started sore yesterday and then today it is more puffy and I kind of put my contact lenses on it. It's not in the eye. It's on the tissue of bottom lid near the edge of the eye. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test which showed okay, everything was okay. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of ulcer on the tongue included had a mouth wash that she used and had done great to my teeth. The ulcers are going to go away, but the eye was. I am just kind of watching it if it gets like whatever tomorrow. I might go to emergency room. It's not in the eye. It's in the lower lid. It's very tender and close to eye."" Consumer further stated, ""I want to know an answer. This is really important to me because this time, I have to take a nerve because as soon as they put the needle in me, my nerves, I just had a panic attack. I was scared.

A 69-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6206 and Expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 12Mar2021 10:45 (at the age of 69-years-old) as 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, seasonal allergies (He controlled them with Zyrtec), hypertension-mild and pollen and grass allergies. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included amlodipine/losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for high blood pressure. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12Mar2021, 13:15 the patient eyes began to water and itch, slightly blurred vision, discharge in both eyes, sensitive to light, substantial fatigue. The patient had 2 major side effects. Both occurred about 2 hours after getting the vaccination. Both worsened as the day went on. The patient had involuntary squint because of itchy and watering eyes, dried discharge closing eyes in morning upon rising. They got significantly worse the following day. His eyes began to water and itch, and vision got slightly blurry. He attributed that to his eyes watering constantly. He does not wear glasses and has close to 20/20 even though he was old. He looks at computer and reads a lot. It got worse until Monday, then it abated slightly. It was still substantial. The right eye was worse than left. Two hours after watery and itching, he did not notice any blurry vision. That was later in the afternoon. As he was writing documents on computer and reading printed material was when he noticed it. There was enough discharge from the watering and tearing that when you wake up, you feel your eyes are glued closed. It has improved slightly in one eye. But it was the same or worse in right eye. Sensitivity to light began around 2 hours after the vaccination while he was in the car driving. Substantial fatigue got worse that night and was moderately bad Saturday, Sunday and Monday. It had abated moderately yesterday and then was worse yesterday and today, but better than the weekend. IT comes and goes and is not continuous. He has never had malaria but thinks it was the same feeling of overwhelming fatigue. He does not have any previous pre-existing conditions. It began with the vaccination. He was not a person of hypochondria and was not particularly worried about this. He was not worried about dying. They are simple side effects with any vaccine. The patient was disturbed when he looked it up. He did not see any symptoms being advertised about eye problems and he was very educated about it. Then when he looked it up, he saw others that had the same thing if not worse. He does not have any information for people that experienced the same thing that he read about online on the internet. Many symptoms that people were reporting were much more severe such as: eyes puffy, face swelling and eyes itchy and crusty. He must have seen 30-35 on two websites that reported and many more on websites on the internet. He then said it could have been 35-40 that he read carefully. Everyone in his family had the vaccine. His son had first dose and experienced no real symptoms. His wife who is a nurse had it 3 weeks ago and only a mild twinge in her arm. She experienced some fatigue yesterday for second dose. It was not really important and nothing that has not been reported. He did not wish to complete report. He was the healthiest person in the family, and he was surprised that he got these side effects. After he got the eye issues, he took Visine. Visine Advanced only clears were up for 10 minutes and then it comes right back. He only used it a few times because it was useless. If the vaccine had not blinded him, he could see the lot number easier. Lot is JJB0300 with expiration Sep2021. It was a total size of 0.284 ounces or 8ml. Visine Advanced gets rid of bloodshot eyes like for drunks. He does not drink though. He would not be willing to send a sample and it was sealed and intact. The patient uses the cetirizine (tablet, 10mg, Lot: 0EE27118 and Expiration date: Jan2022) oral from 13Mar2021 at 10mg twice a day taken for eye problems related to vaccine.

I had a quicker reaction with the second dose than I did the first one but I still had some lingering effects from the first dose when I got the second. How long do these side effects usually last?"" The patient had second COVID 19 vaccine and also had first one. The first dose was on 09Feb21 and she had swelling in arm after shot and has been using a cool cloth on it and was better by the next day. The patient still feels it though and it has been five weeks. The patient tries to turn arm and can still feel it but it was not bad. A day later she had her first skin reaction which was a red rash under both armpits. The patient waited because she wanted to see what reactions she would have with second dose. The reaction from first dose happened for three weeks. The patient has been taking liquid Benadryl everyday sometimes during night and also cold wet compresses in armpits has helped with inflammation. The primary care doctor and talked to the patient to see if she should try some other medication before second shot and the nurse recommended she should not get second shot that she should see an allergist. The patient got second shot and talked to nurse there. The nurse told the patient she would have to come back at least four days after the second shot was due or it would not work together. The patient went ahead and got the vaccine and it has not been life threatening as of now. The patient saw an allergist three days after second shot. The patient had rosy red inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly bilateral armpit and then sometimes ears would get hot. The patient would take Benadryl. The physician told the patient to try to take Allegra 24 hours but the patient stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. The patient took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for her for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra but the Benadryl seemed to help. The allergist felt she made the right decision since her events are not life-threatening since it is not respiratory. The allergist saw her armpits agreed the children Benadryl was working and that she should stick with that. The patient stated, it is not going away been like this the whole time since 02Mar2021 and still having a reaction in her armpits. The patient stated after the second shot the flare up was quicker because first shot was already in system still. It was not a flare up like when someone can not eat seafood and stuff like that. The patient still has a rosy armpit. The patient has not seen her doctor since last year when she had a physical. The patient would inform her doctor about these events. The patient stated she is really blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters and her skin is dry from being inflamed all this time. She squeezes a rag under her armpits and that it is better during the day than at night, it is worse at night. The patient was only taking 20 mL of Benadryl in the morning and then evening before bed. The patient stated, ""the first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose."" The patient hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. The patient was noticing since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face. The second shot she asked the nurse to give in her back upper part of bicep in arm muscle since it was a better location and it did not swell up and it did not hurt. Caller stated the nurse the first time gave the shot like when you see people getting shots on tv they put it really high up in muscle. The patient considered the event as medically significant and that it is ongoing and has worsened. The hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit. The past couple of days her skin has been dry. She has used hand cream but is afraid to put anything else on it because of reaction. Just annoying. The patient will probably put cream on it so it does not crack, it is very dry and it has not been dry like this. The patient has been putting water on at night which could have dried it out. Some days is worse than others more red. This is persisting. Soreness in arm happened right after first shot. The shot was given in the proper way but seemed like more of a reaction. The second shot is much better and that she does not feel it at all. The patient can still feel where the vaccine went in left arm. It was annoying but it does not keep her from moving her arm and it has been five weeks. Since it is not going away it is serious. The patient was not taking Benadryl in middle of day like before but it is itchy so she is going to go out in the cold and work in yard. Before first week or two she would use cool compresses all day and take Benadryl during day and then at night it petered out. The patient was hoping it will fade out eventually. The patient did not want to double up on Allegra as she is not sure what the reaction would be. The medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. The patient only took one pill as it did not work. 24 hour Allegra, 180mg antihistamine 15 tablets per box. The patient was taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. The patient usually takes Zyrtec for seasonal allergies like dust. She took no Zyrtec at all for either shots. She felt the Benadryl worked better and quicker. The patient was at the Allergist she asked what is in this vaccine like what chemical. She looked up the ingredients but did not understand. Her friend told her Polyethylene glycol was in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine. The patient had rosy red, inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly her bilateral armpits and then sometimes ears would get hot. The patient stated her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours.

There were a handful of reports with minimal additional details alluding to a male who passed away in Dec2020 from brain hemorrhage following the Pfizer vaccine-these could be describing the index patient. There were a handful of reports with minimal additional details alluding to a male who passed away in December from brain hemorrhage following the Pfizer vaccine-these could be describing the index patient.  In summary, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have the potential to trigger de novo ITP (including clinically undiagnosed cases), albeit very rarely. Distinguishing vaccine-induced ITP from coincidental ITP presenting soon after vaccination is impossible at this time.  No follow up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information currently provided (plausible time association), it cannot be fully excluded that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination might have played a contributory role in triggering the occurrence of thrombocytopenia complicated by bloody diarrhea leading to blood loss requiring blood products infusion.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021353705 same reporter, different patient, same suspect , different event;US-PFIZER INC-2021014534 same reporter, different patient, same suspect , different event;US-PFIZER INC-2021344239 same reporter, different patient, same suspect , different event; Reported Cause(s) of Death: passed away in December from brain hemorrhage",Y,,,,Y,5,,,U,,,,Test Name: hemoglobin; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:8.7 g/dl; Test Name: platelets; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:60 x10 9/l; Test Name: platelets; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:improvement to 101 x10 9/l; Comments: was discharged 5 days later,UNK,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Diverticulosis; Hypothyroidism; Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (recent),,USPFIZER INC2021353725,2,04/02/2021,,,,

Later 1st day and for next 5 days, EXTREMELY fatigued and tired; VERY hard to concentrate. Sinuses felt a bit congested during this time. Also had difficulty staying asleep first 3 nights after injection. Tiredness and fatigue took approx. 2 1/2 weeks to resolve completely.      After 2nd day I began to experience joint pain and swelling, including elbow and knee. I do not normally have any problems with this. I could barely bend my knee. These symptoms lasted over a week. During this time I also had episodes of mild dizziness and nausea, but nothing that hindered my daily activities.        Redness at injection site, which at one point was 4 - 5 inches in diameter, lasted approx. 2 1/2 weeks before it completely disappeared.  DOSE #2 (03/30/2021)       No problem sleeping after 2nd dose.      Much more pain/redness at injection site.      Again, experiencing extreme fatigue, feeling exhausted, difficulty concentrating.  This time joint pain/swelling is minor.      With the 2nd dose, I also am experiencing swollen lymph nodes (left side, underarm), and a odd taste in my mouth 24/7.      I expect this too will resolve after a few weeks.   In addition to the allergies listed on page one, I do have many other allergies and sensitivities (too many to list on this form). I cannot have wine due to sulfites, processed meat due to nitrites and nitrates, I stay away from most processed food, am allergic to cats and dogs, and have severe reactions to wasp/bee/bug stings and/or bites.

I can not eat or drink anything with artificial sweetener. The list goes on...  So, I am not surprised I reacted like I did to the vaccine.

She ended up getting a cardiac catheterization while she was there which was normal.   The day prior to this she had actually received her second Covid vaccination in her left arm.  She noticed achiness and soreness across her shoulders bilaterally into her chest and into her neck.  She had some subjective fevers and chills and felt generally fatigued.  She also had a lot of swelling in her left axilla and she ended up getting a CT scan during her workup which revealed some left axillary adenopathy.  She returned to the ER on 3/16: while brushing her teeth, she developed right facial paresthesias that marched over approximately 20 minutes to involve the right arm and the right leg.  She went to the hospital.  She was seen in the ER.  They felt this represented possible ischemia.  They gave her tPA.  She had a hemorrhagic nosebleed.  Did not develop any other signs of bleeding. Her symptoms had not resolved.  She was discharged from home.  She had a headache at the time of her visit to the ER.  Her headache had resolved by the time she was discharged home, but she continues to note paresthesias in the right side of her body, right face, and notes over the last day or 2, she has had increased dysarthria, dizziness and slurred speech, brain fog, a sensation of heaviness and inability to think.  She states she currently does not have head pain per se, but she does note that she just feels generally poorly.  She feels like her brain is working faster than her mouth muscles are.  She is in today for neurologic followup, concerned about these ongoing issues.  she continues to struggle with her speech feeling quite slow and deliberate, she feels like it is difficult for her to concentrate, she is forgetful, she still has intermittent episodes of paresthesias in her face, arm, and hand, she feels like she becomes heart and flushed and she has some heart rate variability with her heart going slow and fast, and she has significant disequilibrium.

Able to return to work.  The abdominal discomfort was improved, maybe due to constipation.  Friday of that week, I was able to get to see my primary provider, who is in Omaha, NE to review the situation, and we agreed a liver biopsy was needed.       A week later, Friday, Jan. 29, I had CT guided liver biopsy at  hospital in Omaha. 16 cores taken, and no malignancy found, but significant inflammatory cells, especially lymphocytes.  Meanwhile I have felt fine.  Decided to do a follow up MRI of liver, which was done Friday, April 2, and all the areas have resolved.    There is an entity called ""Inflammatory pseudotumors"" of the liver, and my condition fits with this.  It is very rare.     A consideration would be whether it would be possible to stain the biopsy to see if the lymphocytes carry antibodies to the corona virus.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/08/2021,01/13/2021,5,"normal cbc, cmp, elevated sed rate, MRI  and CT as described.",PVT,,lipitor; pepcid; vit B12; folic acid; vit C: vit D,none,hyperlipidemia; prostate cancer 10 years ago,,,2,04/04/2021,,,,none

I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20+ years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.

I waited 15 minutes and I tried to wake up back again wash my face and I close my eyes and your eyes and my blood pressure played around again and ran to the bed and went back to sleep.

Every time I would be watching TV I would be sleeping without knowing. So basically all throughout the day I fell asleep. I felt very weak  And could not walk at all. The headache would not go away. I felt like I had a cold I felt hot but no fever at all throughout the whole day. My shoulder pain got really bad and my neck but then at the end of the night all that subsided and I got better that was way at night at 8 PM. I then went back to sleep Took a muscle relaxer to make sure that I would sleep throughout the whole night I woke up the third day and I still feel not myself but much way better.

So I just diverted my attention to something else. 2 weeks after at around 12:30pm-1:30 pm I was working that time at the hospital, I felt my left eye felt weird so I ask my co worker to look in my eye. I had a bloodshot. My charge nurse told me to check my BP and it was 158/85. I called my doctor and spoke to the office clerk. I went to eat lunch and at around 3:30-4pm, I rechecked my BP it was around 173/95. I called my doctor and was prescribed with clonidine.

By about 2 pm, I was feeling some soreness and stiffness in my arm.  By about 6pm, the pain in the arm and increased and I was having some loss of range of motion.  I use my computer mouse with my left arm (same as where I got the shot), and I was having trouble moving the mouse.  By 9 pm on the day of the shot, I could not move my arm.  It hung along my left side and would hardly  move more than an inch.  I never lost feeling in that arm, but it wouldn't move. It was as if I'd suffered a stroke.  I had to pick up my left arm with my right arm in order to move it.  For example, in order to undress so I could go to bed, I had to physically lift my left arm and prop it up on a shelf in my bathroom so I could get my sweater off over my head with my right arm.  In addition to loss of all range of motion, I had intense, severe pain in my left arm.  No position was comfortable.  Even lying on my back in bed with my arm at my side made my arm throb horribly.  I usually sleep under a weighted blanket, but I couldn't stand any weight whatsoever on the arm.  The pain (even without the weighted blanket) ran the whole length of my arm, from my shoulder through  my wrist into my fingers.  I'd heard that you shouldn't take anything for pain for the first 24 hours after the shot because it might interfere with the immune reaction, so I didn't take anything.  The next morning (Friday  morning), my arm was still severely painful and unable to be moved.  I couldn't drive because I couldn't lift my left arm enough to grip the steering wheel.  Moving the arm with my right hand still caused horrible pain.  I basically slept or read on the sofa for all of Friday.  By that evening, about 32 hours after the shot, I began to be able to move my left arm a few inches vertically (like a hammer curl) and horizontally (out from my side).  That night, I was able to bear the weight of my weighted blanket on my arm.  By Saturday morning, the pain was drastically reduced.  Saturday morning I could lift my arm to my waist.  By Saturday evening, I could lift my arm to my shoulder.  Sunday I was almost back to normal.  I had only some stiffness and the occasionally twinge if I moved the arm too far too quickly.

No recently fall or injury in last 24 hours.  History of Present Illness    A very pleasant 75yo M who presents to the ED today for evaluation of weakness and left arm pain. He reports that about a month ago, he tripped over his dog and fell, hitting his left shoulder against the box spring on his bed. At the time, he reports he did not have pain in the shoulder, but did have low back pain. He went to his PCP's office on 3/16/21 for evaluation and was not having left shoulder pain at that time; an XR of the lumbar spine was performed which revealed chronic degenerative changes. He was prescribed tramadol and went to PT. Since then, he reports progressive pain in the left shoulder, and gradual loss of mobility in the left shoulder. He also has some swelling in his left hand and wrist. Denies numbness or tingling in the left arm. Today, he was more weak than he has been, and was unable to get up out of bed, so called EMS for assistance. He denies chest pain, dyspnea, cough, headache, lightheadedness or dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, recent illness. Reports he has been eating and drinking normally.   His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, depression, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, OSA on CPAP, morbid obesity with BMI 44, history of PE in 2013 after hernia surgery that was treated with warfarin x 1 year, and history of PSVT s/p ablation in 2013. He received the second dose of his COVID-19 vaccination about a week ago. He tells me he lives at home with his wife, and uses a walker for ambulation for about the past month or so, at the insistence of his daughter after his gait has become increasingly unsteady.   In the ED today, XR of the left shoulder revealed a displaced proximal left humerus fracture. CXR is negative for acute process. Incidentally, he tested positive for COVID-19 today.
