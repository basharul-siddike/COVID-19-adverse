The tightening sensations in my left bicep and tingling in my fingertips became stronger. Then I began to experience pain in my bicep that moved up to my shoulder/clavical area.

The x-ray showed some slight compression of the vertebra in the neck. My husband requested that I be checked for a blood clot. The NP ordered an ultrasound and I returned later that day to have it done. A blood clot was found in the subclavian vessel on the left shoulder/clavical area. I was immediately given Eliquis.

I could open a drawer and it would be dark and that would trigger this minor panic, I was able to close the drawer and think of something else and be just fine. Similar things, triggered by different mundane things kept happening. Then on May 2nd at night I was talking and a similar event triggered what I can only describe as a full blown panic attack. I was lying down and I had to immediately stand up, my mind was full of panic. One thought lead to another and the panic was growing. I have never experienced anything like this before. I had to start walking could not even stand still. Probably a few seconds in I started to do breathing exercises to start to calm myself down. It would work for a few seconds and the panic would creep back in. For what felt like the next 1-2 hours I kept using breathing and meditation techniques to get my mind in control and them was finally able to sleep. Today is May 4 and although the intensity is less I am still experiencing periodic ?panic attacks?. I can look at something mundane and that can trigger the ? I don?t know what to call it - ?anxiety?, Panic, unease and I have to start focusing on something else. There have been periods where I have felt better and almost back to normal and then it triggers again. I do not have a history of any such feeling nor do I ever remember feeling this way. I have never had an event where my mind was not stable, never had it be this disturb ever in my life. I do not believe there have been any other events that may describe this. The vaccine seems like the only change. I have been taking polyethylene glycol 3350 for probably many months, I don?t know if this interacts with the polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. I read that it can cause such neurological issues in children or prolonged use of it can cause loss of minerals which can cause similar issues. I don?t know if the combination of it with the vaccine did anything to exacerbate its effects? My doctor does not seem to think so. He seems to think the power has no such side effects. He says it is possible for the vaccine to cause such symptoms but he cannot be sure. He wrote me a prescription for Paroxetine 10mg ? I am afraid if chemical prescriptions/vaccines have caused this, then if they will really fix it. If I get a full panic attack again I will take it. For now I am trying my breathing and meditation exercises to calm myself if this happens ? it is difficult. My doctor has advised that if this is because of the vaccine the second dose might amplify these issues and to delay the second dose by a week if possible. I am trying to do that. I have looked at forum posts on websites detailing the general sideeffects and in the comments other people have listed similar experiences with anxiety attacks. If you search covid vaccine or Pfizer vaccine and panic attacks or anxiety you will find them. I am submitting this so that you are aware of this experience and can look at it if warranted. That experience was very difficult to get through and if it is caused by the vaccine it has to be addressed. If there is something to find and fix I wish you are able to do that.

1285640,05/04/2021,CO,38.0,38,,M,,"On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.",,,,,,,,,N,04/02/2021,04/02/2021,0,4/5/21 - Went to ER for blood tests and MRI to rule out stroke.

An EKG showed no coronary issues yet at 7 am I was taken to the cardiac catheter lab where it was discovered i had a 100% blockage. A stent was implanted and i was released around 4:30 pm the afternoon of 3/20. The morning of 3/22 I once again experienced severe chest pain and called an ambulance. I was told by the EMT my heart rate reached more than 200. I was rushed back to the same hospital where a 2nd cardiac catheter was performed. It was discovered that the stent implanted 48 hours earlier had a 100% blockage. It was opened and several additional stents were implanted. I was kept in the ICU for 2 days for observation and then released. No one I've spoken with since can verify what caused the 2nd episode. Several people at the hospital speculated the cause for the 2nd attack may have been a single dose of Brilinta that had been missed Saturday evening because by the time my wife got me home from the hospital and settled our pharmacy was closed. She picked up my prescriptions first thing Sunday morning and I took everything as directed. My cardiologist agreed with  me that missing 1 dose should not have caused such an adverse reaction.,,,Y,,Y,5,,,Y,03/18/2021,03/18/2021,0,Check with Health Center,UNK,,"Pravastatin, Motrin, Clobetasol",Heartburn,None,,,2,05/04/2021,,,Y,Penicillin

She had not cut her hair in over 4 years.  She started getting blisters all of her body and her body started turning red.  She lost all her nails on her hands and her feet, very very painful.  She couldn't touch anything, could not walk to the bathroom and had to get a bedside commode and for 3 months she had to wear diapers as she did not have the strength to get out of bed.  She is down to 176# right now ,but weighed 210# at the time of the vaccine.   She has to moisturize her skin every 2-3 hours as she had scales and the dryness was so bad that her skin was cracking and she could see her under skin.  She could not shower as the pressure of the water felt like she was being cut in half.   She went back to the doctor at that time and she refused to help her and told her that the vaccine could not have done that to her, but she had not had any reaction like that before the vaccine.     She has had skin problems her entire life but never had a reaction like this until the vaccine.    She would have to fill the tub with more cold than hot and used aloe vera shampoo and body wash mixed and sit in it and try to run water over her body and it would cause her skin to fall off.   She would have to shower with the lowest setting, and then moisturize again.  She could not bear the feeling of the wind on her skin as it would start to scale and had to have a blanket at all times due to chills.  She still gets blisters a little but moisturizes to make sure that it stays under control.   She is in a lot of pain due to this reaction.  She has gotten to a new doctor who is treating her with Benadryl and steroids, which finally after 5 months has started to help her and improve.    Her skin continued to scale off and if she does not moisturize for 6 hours then she will start to react the same way.

Client presented to the vaccine site today, 05/04/2021, for her second dose appointment. As the vaccinator conducted a health screening, some medical concerns came up. As a result, nurse was called over to consult. Client expressed that while she was waiting in the observation area after her first dose, she developed lower jaw discomfort within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine and it lasted for a total of 30 minutes. Client reported that the discomfort was rated as a 3 out of 10 on a pain scale and since it resolved, it has not come back. Client also reported that the following day, she developed a rash around the injection site. The rash lasted about a week and the client described it as being itchy and that it would exacerbate about 2- 3 times a day. The rash has since resolved, but there is still a slight, bruise- like area at the injection site. Client denied any past medical history and denied any current medical diagnoses. Client is not currently taking any medications and has anaphylactic reactions to Penicillin, IV contrast, Prednisone, and anesthesia. The client reports having a primary care provider, but stated that she did not consult with the provider regarding the symptoms experienced after receiving the first dose. Nurse requested a medical consult and the medical doctors recommended that a set of vital signs be taken. If the vital signs came back within normal ranges, we could proceed. The client would receive the second dose and then wait in the observation area for 30 minutes. Vital signs were taken by medic, at 1224, while the client was sitting: blood pressure: 128/80, heart rate: 76, respiratory rate: 14, and skin was warm, dry, intact, and normal. Vital signs were stable, so patient received the 2nd COVID vaccine (Pfizer, Lot #: EW0167 and expiration date: 08/2021) on 05/04/2021 at 12:21 PM.

He did get COVID vaccine, his first one (4/1/21 at Imaginetics) about a week to a week and a half before admission. He said shortly thereafter is when his symptoms began. The rash is pruritic. He had no breathing troubles whatsoever. No throat closing or tongue swelling, etc. No mouth lesions and in fact the rash over his torso and his back is pretty minimal, looks more like a sunburn type appearance. In any case, also had a petechial type of purpuric rash on his legs and I did show this to Dermatology who felt that it did look like vasculitis. He was placed on                                                                                                                                                                                                                      steroids. He did SOLU-MEDROL while here and this was converted to prednisone on discharge for which he will continue with for the next few weeks. Slow taper. Rash had improved over his stay here. His LFTs were also up somewhat as well, but these did improve while he was here and multiple imaging studies were done including ultrasound, CAT scan and abdominal Doppler all were negative for any kind of                                                        pathology. Suspect probably these elevated LFTs could have been from vasculitis and that is also improving now with the steroids. He is tolerating diet well. He has no abdominal pain.

He was hospitalized for rash suspected to be vasculitis and elevated LFTs-started 2-3 days after his COVID vaccine. Etiology of elevated LFTs unclear. Liver US and CT were negative. Hepatitis, viral testing, and ANA negative. Received his first COVID vaccine on 4/1. Still on prednisone taper for rash. He is feeling better, still somewhat tired. Rash is almost resolved. Current complaints sore on the left side of his tongue for the past 11 days. Initially hurt when he would eat, is better now. Is back at work. Denies abdominal pain nausea, vomiting, stool changes, dark or light stools, yellowing of skin, swelling in abdomen or legs. Does not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. No history of liver issues. Normal LFTs 7 months ago. Follow up appt at Allergy/Immunology on 4/29/21: Plan: Patient had a delayed reaction to his 1st dose of Pfizer vaccination that included symptoms of arthralgias, rash as well as elevated liver enzymes.  His symptoms don't meet criteria for type 1 IgE mediated reaction so skin testing would not be beneficial.  His symptoms required hospitalization and improved with tapered steroid course.  His symptoms did not fit DRESS syndrome criteria as he did not have peripheral eosinophilia, fevers, sloughing of skin/oral mucosa or blistering.  We discussed how there is not much data or case reports about how to proceed with completing vaccination for COVID.  I would recommend he get Johnson & Johnson vaccination since it is a different class of vaccine and he may not have the same reaction but again this is not guaranteed.  There is a small chance of clotting with Johnson & Johnson vaccine as well.  He should pre-medicate with cetirizine 20 mg po qday for 1 week before vaccination and 2 weeks after.  I would also suggest he get a steroid course to have on hand from his PCP in case rash starts again after vaccination.  It may be beneficial to have him get lab work several days after vaccination as well (U/A, CBC, CMP) to evaluate for any inflammation.",,,,,Y,3,,,Y,04/01/2021,04/03/2021,2,"Bilirubin Total:  4/12/21 - 2, 4/21 - 1.3, 4/28/21 - 1.4 Bilirubin Direct: 4/12/21-105, 4/21/21-0.7, 4/28/21-0.7 Bilirubin Indirect: 4/12/21-0.5,  4/21/21- 0.6, 4/28/21 - 0.7 Alkaline Phosphatas,/ e: 4/12/21- 159, 4/21/21- 131, 4/28/21- 125 ALT  - SGPT:  4/12/21-229, 4/21/21- 83, 4/28/21- 56 AST-SGOT: 4/12/21-180, 4/21/21- 26, 4/28/21-25",PVT,,None,None,Diverticulosis,,,2,05/04/2021,,,,None

Fever of 100.4, resolved after 1 day. Nausea, increased blood glucose. Continued fatigue and muscle pain/weakness. Following day my scalp, upper back/shoulder blades down arms to finger tips were burning as though I was on fire. This has been relentless. Beginning the second week, it has spread to my ears, several inches down my torso and includes the front of my body as well. Extremely sensitive to touch, including clothing and increased temperature (standing next to someone/ walking outside). There is immense pressure/pain that comes and goes in all of these areas as though they are in a vice. It is at its worst in the evening and first thing in the morning depending on how I slept (ie: if I lay on my stomach, my entire abdomen has so much pressure and pain for the first hour or two I literally can not stand it ? same if I sleep on my back, etc). It is increased by even minimal exertion such as walking around the house. I have missed an extensive amount of work at this point because I am sent home almost every shift. For the first two weeks I had additional worrisome symptoms that were fortunately relieved with an increased, second course of prednisone. The first being intermittent difficulty with reading comprehension, basic math, spelling, following directions, etc. I am still mentally sluggish but it is not alarming as it once was. The other major concern regarded my heart. Particularly at night, with no apparent arrhythmia, I could feel a sensation that led me to believe my heart was not functioning properly. There was an unusual sensation accompanied by slight discomfort, seemingly exacerbated by the muscle relaxer I have taken nightly for at least a year. My anxiety and irritability worsened 24 hours after injection but to be fair I am unsure if that is related to vaccine or the symptoms themselves.   I have been to the ER and have seen 2 additional physicians, including my PCP twice. I have tried three courses of steroids, one at 20 mg x 7 days, two at 30 mg x 5 days.

I moved around as instructed by my doc, and after 15 minutes went back to my car.  I noticed after another several minutes that my pulse was still elevated so opted to go back in and talk to a health care professional.  Pulse was 120.  Paramedic wanted me to lie down in waiting area but I didn't want to be in such a potentially  germy environment, and the guy next to me who had fainted earlier was just getting up himself.  She walked me back to my car, where I agreed to wait, listen to a stress relief hypnosis audio and see if my pulse rate would calm down.  She came back out w/ a BP cuff and said my blood pressure was 210 over 130 (or some number over 100; I don't recall which) and she said I needed to get in an ambulance right away and go to the hospital.  I said I would make my own decisions about my body and I wanted to try a couple of other things first, promised not to leave, contacted my doctor, naturopath.  (Note: I did not have any other worrisome symptoms -- blurred vision, dizziness, etc.  My head was a little buzzy, but whether out of fear or in reaction to the shot I didn't know.  I was a little flushed).  He asked me a bunch of questions, said my body hadn't had time to mount an immune response to the vaccine and that I had likely had a histamine reaction to a preservative in the vaccine (or similar), which a couple of his other patients had experienced.  He asked if I'd been drinking fluids (yes, plenty), had eaten recently (no, so he suggested I have some food; I had some nuts, a little cheese and some Cheez-Its so had that), asked if I had an antihistamine around -- I did, but I don't do well with Benadryl and didn't have Claritin, but after looking through my bag found some Allervive, an herbal product he compounds.  He said, ""That's perfect.""  I took two of the three capsules and hung up.  Staff were checking up on me in my car every ten minutes or so, by the way, very kind and professional as I had been quite upset at the whole ""get in an ambulance"" scenario.  He thought some of my reaction was probably also stress-related, and I noticed before the shot that I was teary, not from anxiety but the kind you get when you feel relief after a long ordeal.  I didn't feel anxiety, really, until the first blood pressure measurement.  He also let me know that if the bottom number didn't drop below 100 they couldn't let me go.  After eating, drinking some more water and taking the Allervive my BP was down to 138 over 75 in just a few minutes.  I agreed to stick around and make sure it stuck.  We re-tested again about 15 minutes later, perhaps longer, and it was the same.  I had been a little flushed but that had gone away too.  I left and went for a light walk and eventually drove home without incident.  I had symptoms after the shot that could have been related to my body fighting off the allergic reaction or to the vaccine itself, but they were pretty mild (fatigue later that night; occasional heart rate elevation sometimes after eating or with very mild exertion -- not unusual for me if I'm ""fighting off"" something; sore, itchy, red blotch sized between a quarter and a half dollar at vaccination site -- it is still a little tender today and appears a bit bruised; a bit sinus headache-y for three days, especially when I bent down to tie my shoes or something like that - also not that unusual as I often seem to ""cleanse"" through my sinuses when I have a bug or am fighting something off).    In hindsight, I think the symptoms I had after the first shot, which lasted about 9 hours, may have been fighting off the allergic reaction and not a reaction to the virus vaccine itself.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/28/2021,04/28/2021,0,,OTH,,"Montelkast, Spironolactone, herbal hormone tincture compounded by naturopath, herbal thyroid supplement, herbal liver cleanse supplement, mood support, compound hormone capsules, progesterone cream, vaginal compounded estrogen cream, Albute","Not ill, but exposure at home to chemical spray (inside bathroom ductwork and outside on deck) from downstairs neighbor that is an asthma trigger has created a LOT of stress; also exposure to weeks of dog urine on patio below from same neighbor.

She went to bed and noticed that her breast was hurting in the night, but she was too tired to get up at that point, when woke up and took a shower she lifted the left breast and saw a massive, bigger than pancake, rash. It was on the bottom of the breast and it ran down to the stomach, it also had white lumps on it, this just frightened her. There was severe redness before, but that has started to fade, it was still dark brown right now, like she can see outline, but it was going away. Before when there was redness, she could press the spot and it would turn white, it would be red again. When read the instruction that came it says there could be a side effect of a rash, but it would be all over the body not localized. She does not know if the vaccine was responsible for it. Then just quickly she started having heart palpitations on Sunday, just a few, but on Monday it was like a 100 of them. She called doctor, at this point that she also has a history of thyroid cancer in 1982, they removed 2/3rds of her thyroid and since then she has been on Synthroid. When her thyroid was not working properly, she had a TSH done. She got lab work done just to see if it was the thyroid. The doctor said it could be from the shot. The Heart Palpitations were fading, she stopped taking Synthroid for 1 day and it went from 100 palpitations to 50, to like 6-7 now. The heart palpitations were going away and that was after stopping the Synthroid for 1 day. The Light headedness only lasted for 20 minutes but started 5 minutes after getting the shot. She clarified that it was not lightheadedness she means to say that she was a little foggy and had a different feeling. The tingling in the Left Breast began, it was for a couple hours, she thought it was different. Normally she doesn't have that. She has had 6 breast operations, so she has very little feeling in that breast normally. Her left breast began to hurt when she was sleeping, she was too tired to get up and look, she rolled over felt something was wrong. This was at 2-3AM on and it subsided when she took shower and patted all around, she dried it and kept an eye on it, the pain started to go away easily. She did notice that she started to feel a little bit of an itch, but that went away quickly too. She had the rash and lumps, it was during the shower she lifted the breast and saw it. She has a picture to provide. It is Not ongoing, it has started to fade, it is still dark reddish brown, but she can tell it was going away. The heart palpitations started late at 4 or 5 in the evening, she has not had that for years.

Why was the patient taking Concomitant Products Centrum Silver for people over 50 years (Verbatim): Multivitamin Patient History: No Investigation Assessment: Yes Additional Context: This consumer is the patient who has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines. About 8-11 days after first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out. About 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning. He clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8-11 days.  Consumer is not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. He does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can't figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines.   Patient: Age at onset: Over the age of 65 years. Reporter: Address: Unknown. Primary: Further address details/Email: Unknown. Very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out: Onset about 8-11 days after first dose was administered, maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021. He went to the emergency room on the date of event onset and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00-18:00 the following day. While in hospital he had EKGs of his head-verified this information with caller repeatedly; MRIs of his head; CTs of his head; and echocardiograms of his heart. All of those tests came back ok, nothing abnormal on results. They recommended he have a stress test done which was not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning: Onset was about 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. He has never had vertigo in his life before event. He went back to the emergency room on date of onset of this event, but was not admitted to the hospital at that time; was only in the emergency room about 5-6 hours. While in the emergency room he had CT scans of his head, MRIs of his head and EKGs and everything looks good, nothing abnormal on results. Outcome: He still has ongoing very lightheaded episodes for a good part of the day. Those episodes usually last about 30 minutes and occur multiple times daily but are not really severe like the 2 initial events were following the first dose and then the second dose. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: First dose: 26Jan2021 Lot: EL9263 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 Second dose: 15Feb2021 Lot: EL9267 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 - verified with reporter that details were same for both first and second doses. This completed his prescribed therapy. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions caller reported he really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. Regarding other testing/investigations done relative to these events:  He had a nuclear stress test and exercise stress test, both performed on 10Mar2021 he believes and results of those tests were they both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. He has gone to the ENT-ear, nose and throat doctor where he had a balance test done which he referred to also as a VNG test-Videonystagmography done on 17Mar2021. He will get results of balance test on Wednesday, 24Mar2021.  He had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3-4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. He is not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit.

It's # (Hence follow-up was checked). Well I have been having some strange things that I don't know if its Covid shot related but it's symptom like I never had before. After I had received the first shot, I had almost a very light headache where I almost fainted. We went to ER, they were sort of testing, it might be stroke like symptom and they did a MRI of my brain and they did CT scan of my brain and CT scan contrast. They did micro cardiogram, some EKGs and work. All of those come back normal. So I spent the night in hospital, they sent me the next day. I continued to have some light headed symptoms but nothing real bad but continued to have symptoms which was not normal for me. After I had my shot about 10 days after the second shot, I had another episode. This was much more vertigo like or the room is spinning and the walk and things are moving. I did go back to ER again just in case there was something going on. They tested again another CT scan and EKG and everything looked normal and they said it sounded like a vertigo related. I told him I had shot about 10 days after each shot, the symptoms hit me. Because of the first episode my family doctor ordered some other testing done, and they did stress test of my heart, a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test of my heart and both came back normal. But I am continuing to have the light headed, the episodes just about daily. Sometimes they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes I have a good day but I have those light headed episodes and I never had it before I got the shot. I am also going ENT- ear, nose and throat doctor to check on vertigo stuff and they did some testing last week and I am supposed to get the result tomorrow on what they found about vertigo test but I never had vertigo or light headed or anything before the shot. So I don't know if anybody else is reporting this but I had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them 10ish days after each shot and I am continuing to have light headed episodes but not severe as those 2 but I had light headed dizzy episodes daily, since the Covid vaccine. I want to report it, so you guys have a report file and other people reporting it. I guess I sort of want to know if you guys were having any other report or something like this. So that I know it might be related to the shot. I am still working with my ENT and I tried to figure out if it's vertigo. If it's not vertigo then they have really run all sorts of test and if it's not vertigo we don't know if Covid shot triggered the vertigo or not. Let me know, we don't know. So they have ran 30,000 dollar test on me and so far all my tests are coming back normal."" Consumer was informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety and Pfizer Medical Information.

We went to ER, they were sort of testing, it might be stroke like symptom and they did a MRI of my brain and they did CT scan of my brain and CT scan contrast. They did micro cardiogram, some EKGs and work. All of those come back normal. So I spent the night in hospital, they sent me the next day. I continued to have some light headed symptoms but nothing real bad but continued to have symptoms which was not normal for me. After I had my shot about 10 days after the second shot, I had another episode. This was much more vertigo like or the room is spinning and the walk and things are moving. I did go back to ER again just in case there was something going on. They tested again another CT scan and EKG and everything looked normal and they said it sounded like a vertigo related.""

She said she was so so sick, she thought she was going to die, it happened the next day 13Mar2021, exactly 24 hours after getting the shot. She got the shot 12Mar2021, the next day 24 hours after exactly was when she got sick. Caller reported that right now, she doesn't feel sick, but there were days when she felt strangely tired, unusually tired, but she was normally a very high energy person. On the 13Mar2021, she felt good, her arm was hurting a little bit, she felt herself, she went to do her errands, and while she was in the supermarket, that was when she started to feel lightheaded. There were moments when she still feels lightheaded. So that day she finished her shopping, she decided she was not going to continue, she just got a couple of things, and she directed herself to pay because what she was feeling was unknown, strange, an unusual sensation. She felt that something was not right. She went to car, drove, all of a sudden, halfway, about 10 minutes before she got home she felt that she was missing air, she couldn't breathe well. Everything started at 2:30 pm, and she knows that because the shot was given to her 12Mar2021 at 2:30 pm. Then immediately she started to get dizzy, nausea, badly nauseous, her body was freezing, she started to feeling like her blood was going away, she felt like she was frozen, she was shaking, she got to the parking lot by a miracle and she was doubting how she was going to get home, she felt like her head was going to explode. All this time she was having these symptoms, she was wanting to throw up really bad. She was frozen, and doesn't know how she made it home, she lived on the second floor, she got straight to the bathroom, she felt like she wanted to throw up so bad, she tried and tried, nothing come up, she felt like she was gonna die. Finally she threw up bile. She had no strength of anything, she couldn't even move her hands, she was holding herself by the toilet, she laid down in the bathroom, she felt like she was going to faint. She didn't know if she was going to die or faint, she took a deep breath, laid down in bathroom, couldn't move, and then later on she crawled to her bed. She was able to crawl, but every time she moved, everything was moving around her, she was extremely dizzy, no strength, she says thank god her bed was very low. She called her son and she told her son that she was feeling very sick. Her son said he was going to call the number, he is a nurse, call these number so they can tell you what you can do. It was some number to call if someone was having a bad reaction from the shot. Her son told her that she was supposed to feel this way. She wondered how could that be. Patient stated that her son told her that feeling would pass in couple hours, and to just rest. Her son was checking on her every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes, and then she fell asleep for 3 hours. When she woke up, she was not feeling so bad anymore but her head felt tight, it was not a not clear headache, her head was like if someone blew up a balloon, tight tight tight in her head. At that time, when she woke up, it was almost 11pm, and she was feeling just a little tiny bit better. So she moved her feet, she wondered if she could make it to the refrigerator to get water? She got to fridge, opened it, smelled food, went to bathroom to throw up again. She says also, her body aches. She was miserable that day, 13Mar2021, and after that she exhausted for about a week, she was lightheaded, had a little bit of vertigo and was all tired. She went to bed early because she was exhausted. She was scheduled to get second dose on the 2nd. She was going to talk to her doctor.

Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus.

She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn't swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red.

As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn't catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn't see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

Patient had major aches in muscles (legs & arms) and hip joints-muscle pain, joint pain, tiredness after the first vaccination. Before her present health issue began after her first Pfizer vaccine shot, patient had never been tested for possible autoimmune problems. Within a week (I believe the timing), she began to feel migrating pain and stiffness around her body and was very lethargic. She had aches and often stiffness in her legs and arms, a dry cough, and night sweats. Her mouth became parched. Her eyes had suffered from dryness in the past and became even more acute. At night she had trouble sleeping because of the increasing pain. Again, the pain was strange in that it migrated around her body. At first, her primary care physician, Dr.(name) did not recognise her symptoms, didn't order any tests, and sent her to physical therapy. After a month (after the second vaccination), when the body pains and tiredness got worse, and her ankle swelled, she sent her for blood tests at (name) Diagnostic on 23Feb2021. The result came back positive for Sjogren's, a disease she had never heard of before. Later a Rheumatologist ran a confirmatory test with lab corp. With the same result in return.

About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn't tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn't want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn't used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn't want it to get worse.

A female patient of an unspecified age received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, enquired have people died from the vaccine or not. Enquired what do you know about the news in the media about reports of death in nursing home elderly patients. Response: Pfizer and BioNTech are aware of reported deaths following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine . We are working with the (withheld) to gather all the relevant information. (Withheld) Authorities have prioritized the immunization of residents in Nursing Homes, most of whom are very elderly with underlying medical conditions and some which are terminally ill. (Withheld) confirm the number of incidents so far was not alarming, and in line with expectations. All reported deaths would be thoroughly evaluated by (Withheld) to determine if these incidents are related to the vaccine. (Withheld) Health Authorities have now changed its recommendation in relation to vaccination of the terminally ill (Clinical Frailty Scale 8 or higher). Our immediate thoughts are with the bereaved families. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety subcommittee met virtually on Tuesday, 19Jan2021, to review available information and data on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals who had received the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2 (hereafter, BNT162b2). Experts invited from the (Withheld) and the (Withheld) provided an overview of deaths reported in (Withheld) and in the WHO global database (VigiBase) following vaccination with BNT162b2."" Based on a careful scientific review of the information made available, the subcommittee came to the following conclusions: The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2. Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events. In view of this, the committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of BNT162b2 remains favourable in the elderly, and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of this vaccine."" Enquired what was the efficacy after one dose. Caller had a terrible experience after her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine.

Caller was upset and disconnected the call before some of the answers were given. Caller also asked the following questions: Has there been deaths reported from the vaccine or not, what was the efficacy after 1 dose, any guidance on getting the second dose after having side effects after the first dose. Response: Proposed response : CONS-Blood clots. Caller said ""this was ridiculous"" when I tried providing her with a long website with more information. She feels like we are withholding information from the public. She thinks the deaths should have been on the media. Caller hung up. Enquired do you have any guidance on getting the second dose after having side effects with the first dose. I had a side effect after the first dose of the vaccine. Should I get the second dose or not. Caller disconnected before agent could provide response. Response: Proposed response: As noted in the Fact Sheet for Recipients, you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason could not be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection.

I just went on vars reporting system and it says if shots were over six weeks ago I could not participate, but I just read that adverse reactions can happen after that date. I also have a possible second theory on my adverse reaction that happened to me last week, went to my primary, mentioned it to pharmacy where I got second dose of shingles and needed up at hospital Er, and mentioned reporting...but no one seemed to decide to report from their end and if they did, I was not told. I had my first Pfizer shot at shopping center 2/3/21. Only mild symptoms mainly at shot arm. Second COVID same place 2/24/21. I did have fatigue that started that evening from a morning shot and had a headache that lasted the second day after shot. I had my first Shingrix shingles shot in Oct 2020. Normally one gets second shingles in six months. With COVID hitting I concentrated on that...the COVID shots listed above. After second COVID I asked pharmacist about when to get second shingles. They suggested I wait at least two weeks. I was told second shingles shot is tougher by them, and many retired friend I know. I am an active adult, finally getting back to the gym after COVID shots and playing some tennis. I decided to wait a little longer and had my second Shingrix shot 4/5/2021. This hit me hard. I was in bed for four days. Fever, chills, adverse stomach pain, headache...flu symptoms. I do go to a Dr. I have Barrett?s esophagus and take famotidine twice a day. The stomach pain got severe. I went to health clinic and the nurse practitioner put me on Dexilant for two weeks only. I have bad osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.....inherited. Along with my career in the school system I was a certified fitness instructor, aerobics, weights, step, water...up until age 52. After my cervical fusion I stopped teaching, but continued as always to work out in the gym and play league tennis. I?ve gone to pain management since then and keep my cortisone shots to a min on my hip, hands and cervical because of bone density. Saturday 4/22 my mouth started feeling sore. By Sunday it was burning pain. Could hardly eat and brushing my teeth was excruciating. Monday I called my dentist to cancel my six month teeth cleaning. I started reading about delayed COVID adverse reaction and shingles shot adverse reactions. On Tuesday morning 8am I went to my primary Dr at Medical center. The inside of mouth all red. My lips and face were swollen, even my tongue had numbness.Talked about shots, also herpes....which I have never had. One partner and husband for 45 years. They put me on a prednisone pack and told me to take Benadryl. I was also having cramping in my right calf. Figured I was dehydrated at was working at drinking a lot of water. By 3pm husband was not home. Cramping in right calf got worse. Drove myself to Hospital ER center across street. They did a sonogram to make sure I was not getting a blood clot. It was negative and went home to continue prednisone regiment. Woke up Wed morning with a sheath of blisters in my mouth. It was painful and it seems I had broken out with a case of shingles in my mouth. Obviously I called the Dr. I was making sure it was not going to my throat or affecting my breathing. Now a week later my mouth is better and off prednisone. My personal theory is either I had a delayed reaction to COVID shots, or a severe reaction to second shingles shot or a combination of my immune system being overloaded with work producing antibodies that by the time I got the second shingles shot five weeks after second COVID at age 65 it was too much. I want to be contacted on both reaction accountability for COVID and Shingrix...and possible new thoughts as to how hard having multiple vaccinations so close together. I also feel that the adverse reaction to severe stomach pain and swelling ...etc seemed to be shingrix related with a combination of immune system overload.","Please read entire context. Had both Pfizer COVID shots first 2/3/21 second 2/24/21 then second shingles Shingrix shot 4/5/21. Read entire synapse.

Literature Citation:  A study participant (age, gender not reported) received the anthrax vaccine (date, dose, lot not reported) and cited several problems that occurred following injection including muscle control issues (PT: muscle disorder), GI symptoms (PT: gastrointestinal disorder), and severe headache (PT: headache). The time to onset and outcome were not reported. No further information was provided.  Literature Abstract: Most people have no problems when administered vaccines; however, as with all drugs, reported adverse effects (rAEs) do occur. There is a need to better understand the potential predictors of reported vaccine AEs (rVaxAEs), including modifiable (environmental) predictors. Individuals who have Gulf War Illness (GWI) report increased experiences of drug experiences of drug and chemical rAEs, extending to rVaxAEs. Individuals provide an opportunity to examine the relationship between their reported exposures and rAEs. Forty-one individuals with GWI and 40 healthy controls reported exposure and rAEs to exposure, including 14 vaccines. Individual and summed vaccine exposures, rVaxAEs, and reported Vaccine AE Propensity (summed rVaxAEs / Summed vaccine exposures) were compared in cases vs. controls. Exposure-outcome assessments focused on individuals, using a multivariable regression with robust standard error. More designated vaccines were reported in cases than in controls: 9.0 (2.3) vs. 3.8 (2.3), p<0.0001.  The fraction of vaccines received that led to rAEs was ten-fold higher in cases: 0.24 (0.21), vs. 0.023 (0.081), p<0.0001. Multivariable assessment confirmed that radiation and pesticides remained significant statistical predictors of reported Vaccine AE Propensity. Exposure tied to excess rVaxAEs in individuals may contribute to, or underlie, the reported link between rVaxAEs in individuals and later ill health.  Company Comment:  The information received from the article is not specific and refers to a multiple vaccinations that included anthrax vaccine as the most reactogenic and most with reported reactions comparing to other vaccines. However, there was one subject that reported headache and unspecific term of gastrointestinal and muscle disorder post injection. Headache is a known phenomenon that occur post BioThrax injection. Nausea is the only gastrointestinal disorder that has been recorded in clinical studies and postmarketing reports. The report of muscle control issue is too general to define its meaning. Just because the report says that the occurrence was post injection, it is assumed that it was temporal relationship, therefore headache is considered probable but the gastrointestinal and muscle disorder are considered possible, although being an unspecific term the relevance is missing.; Sender's Comments: The information received from the article is not specific and refers to a multiple vaccinations that included anthrax vaccine as the most reactogenic and most with reported reactions comparing to other vaccines.

During the same time, blotchy rashes appeared all over my face, neck but a different hive-like pattern of rashes appeared on my chest and minimally on my thigh.  I also developed severe dermatitis on my fingers.  They swelled until they blistered and cracked.  The burning and itching was tremendous.  I had never experienced such fatigue either.  I had to wrap my fingers for weeks.  Throughout these symptoms, I went to Urgent Care and was placed on prednisone... it cleared up for about 3 days then returned full blast.  So then I went to dermatology who did an extended prednisone taper (& prescribed hydroxyzine).  Before that treatment course was even completed, symptoms were coming back so I saw a different doctor through my PCP office.  I was given an expensive steroid cream and a long-lasting steroid injection with benedryl.  Finally, the rashes across my face and chest were cleared up.  I was feeling like myself again having normal energy level, but that ended 3-4 days later.  I had a return visit to dermatology where a biopsy was completed (came back as an allergic reaction to either a medication or contact dermatitis).   A friend who's son battled severe eczema then had me try 2 creams for my hands which helped to heal the deep cracks and lose the callused skin; however, it's May 5, 2021 and my hands are flaring up (swollen to the point that 3 fingertips are turning maroon, starting to callus and I imagine will crack open within days again).  My energy levels are no where near my baseline.  I consume an awful lot of caffeine and sleep 10-12 hours a day/night in order to get through work and other tasks.  No one has been able to successfully treat me for 3 months now.    I will add that after my 1st vaccine on 1/7/21, a WEEK later, I had lip, tongue and throat swelling.  I took OTC allergy medicine around the clock for a week and symptoms subsided.  I reported this at the time of my 2nd injection and was told to proceed as it was ""delayed"" versus anaphylaxis.  I had no health issues prior.  My only known allergies/sensitivities over 38 years was penicillin (hives), cheap metals (rash) and cats... none of these have even came close for comparison of what I suspect the vaccine did to my immune system.  I work in a hospital and am very fearful I will have similar reactions to the flu vaccine now or worst, the COVID vaccine will be mandatory.",,,,,,,,,N,02/04/2021,02/07/2021,3,3/31/21 biopsy done on chest for this particular rash,OTH,,depo injection,none,none,COVID19 (Moderna) 1st injection,,2,05/05/2021,,Y,,penicillin

I tried Benadryl before I went to ER but it made me overly tired. At the ER the doctor diagnosed me with allergic reaction to the shot. He prescribed a course of Prednisone to calm the rash. I had a very active rash for OVER two weeks between April 12 to the week of April 26, and there is still remnants of the rash today, which I hope do not reactivate at any time.

Because I was having continuous pain, I was given morphine but it didn't work. So they upped it and gave me dilaudid and that took the pain away. It was in the doctors best interest I get transported to a facility with a good cardiatric team. Upon arriving to the new facility, they further drew my blood and ran more tests. I got admitted as an in patient on the cardiatric floor. The cardiologists ordered for me to have an echocardiogram done, another CT scan with a special protocol to view my heart, and an MRI done of my heart.   After my echocardiogram and CT scan came back fine, the doctors said they'd be surprised if the MRI DIDNT show something. When that result came back, it did reveal my heart was still inflamed.   After ruling out all other possibilities they concluded that the 2nd Dose of Moderna COVID vaccination I'd received was the culprit behind my diagnosis. My diagnosis being, a case of myocarditis as well as a mild heart arrhythmia.   For the next several months I am kn a medication called metoprolol 25mg, 2 half tablets a day, to correct my heart arrhythmia and relieve stress from my heart as well as minimize the amount of stress I encounter each day.

Next morning I felt pretty fatigued but nothing I haven?t felt before. Sore arm was still there. Pretty manageable. Had to pick up groceries and that was a mistake. Had to take deep breaths and my knees were in a lot of pain as I got out of the car and walked through the store (I injured them years ago and now have Baker's cysts). Wife brought me home and I had rigors on the ride back.  I got home around 11:45 or so and I put on a blanket. I felt so hot I started to get a little bit delusional and very sad/started getting teary. Took off blanket and couldn?t get off the couch or walk without help. Knees now felt like about to fall apart. Wife takes temp shows 107, makes ice bath, I get in and it goes down to 105 a few minutes later. Temp went down to 103 over the next 15-20 minutes and stayed there. Got out with her help and still couldn?t stand up or walk without help.  Sat upright in bed rest of the day. Fever ranged from 98-103, mostly 101-103. Took a very cold shower later in the day but temp still stayed in the same range. All other symptoms mentions else stayed the same. I also now had no appetite and felt nauseous. Stomach felt rock hard, and I didn?t feel too with it. Finally fell asleep later at night and woke up feeling way better but still awful. Monday and Tuesday I had to take off work I felt so fatigued. Both of those days I had no fever, it went away from Sunday night into Monday. I can walk by myself now and just feel a little fatigued today. I have my appetite back now and am back to work.  I should mention that I took Tylenol which didn?t help.

On 4/12/21, I was scheduled for my 1st dose of the Moderna as well as having a first trimester NCIT testing being done. At that exam, my provider was able to find a fetal heart rate (177), he was dated to be approximately 12 weeks and 6 days, and there were no concerns at that time regarding physical abnormalities or brain deformities. Additionally, I was sent out for bloodwork to rule out Trisomies and determined gender of the baby. The results of that lab work came back as negative and we were expecting our first son October 19, 2021. However, yesterday, 5/4/21, I attended my monthly prenatal appointment and the provider informed me that she could not find a heartbeat. She used a doppler scanner and then the in office ultrasound machine; neither of which detected a heartbeat. I was sent out to Radiology for a formal scan to refute or affirm the findings. Sadly, the results came back that I had lost my child. There was no heartbeat found and the results showed that my child stopped growing and remained 12 weeks in size.

It lasted for about 2 hours, subsided, and then happened again around 8pm. Once the 2nd round of pain came on, I checked myself into Labor and Delivery to make sure everything was okay with the baby. They ran many tests and could not find an issue. They made me leave without resolving anything. The following day I called my doctor about what happened and she scheduled me to have an ultrasound looking at my gallbladder. The following week we found that I had gallstones so I met with a surgeon and he suggested I have surgery to get my gallbladder removed. I cannot do this until after I give birth. I was out of work for 5 days because of the pain. When talking to my doctor, she thinks the trigger of the gallbladder attack was the glucose drink and not the vaccine.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/26/2021,03/02/2021,4,Ultrasound on gallbladder - 3/5/2021 Results of gallstones on 3/8/2021,UNK,,Prenatal and 2 baby aspirins everyday,none,none,,,2,05/05/2021,,Y,Y,none

ED note: Signed (Electronic Signature): 4/1/2021 5:15 PM  Signed By: MD     ED COURSE & MEDICAL DECISION MAKING   Pertinent Labs & Imaging studies reviewed. (See chart for details)   Labs: Laboratory studies are essentially unremarkable.    4:17 PM: Patient initially assessed.    4:20 PM: I consulted neurology.    5:05 PM: Patient reevaluated and updated after neurology evaluation and head CT. She endorses right-sided throbbing head pain and increased strength in her right side. Her mother was on the phone during this evaluation. The patient's father was updated, as he walked into the room during the evaluation.    5:12 PM: Radiologist confirming CT scans are negative.    10:17 PM: Patient reassessed and updated. We discussed plans for discharge and she is in agreement.    Patient is a 20 y.o. female with a history of pituitary adenoma and migraines who presents with right sided weakness and blurred vision after receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine. On initial exam patient's vital signs are stable. Patient's physical exam was notable for mild weakness to right side of face with forehead preserved and left extremity strength 5/5. She is alert and oriented x3. The patient has right extremity strength 3/5 in arm and leg and her light touches are in tact, but subjectively abnormal on the right. Clinical considerations include, but are not limited to, stroke, CVA, atypical migraine, medication side effect, brain mass, aneurysm, ICH, increased ICP, and seizure disorder.    On arrival the patient did have clear right-sided weakness concerning for acute stroke, therefore I ordered labs, a chest x-ray, a head and neck CTA, a head CT, and a brain MRI. I gave 324mg ASA, Benadryl, and compazine. A chest x-ray reveals no acute abnormality. A head CTA reveals no CTP evidence of core infarction or ischemic penumbra. A head CT reveals no acute intracranial abnormalities. A CTA of the head and neck is negative. The patient was seen by our neurology team who felt the presentation was consistent with a complex migraine.  The patient did develop a headache during her ER course.  Because of the concern for complex migraine patient did receive Benadryl and Compazine and an MRI was ordered.  A MRI shows no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm.   The MRI showed no acute abnormality, the patient states her headache is better and her symptoms have resolved.  This indicates there is no evidence for acute stroke, and is likely complex migraine.  Given the patient's marked improvement she is safe for discharge to home.  She does have a neurology specialist, I will refer her back to that specialist.   FINAL IMPRESSION   1. Hemiplegic migraine without status migrainosus, not intractable      DISPOSITION Discharged to home. The patient was asked to return to the emergency department for worsening illness or if needed.

Initially, she did not require any oxygen, but did require 2 L nasal cannula at night on the second night, at which time remdesivir and convalescent plasma were administered.  She was also given dexamethasone, but had marked rise in her blood sugar to greater than 400. The dexamethasone was tapered and stopped.  Glucose regulated with insulin.  The patient initially had severe anorexia, poor oral intake, but this slowly improved.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis has shown the small nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  There is some ascites and mild pleural effusions.  The patient had been receiving some IV fluids, and we would discontinue the Lasix because of low blood pressure.  There was no other obvious explanation for her poor oral intake or abdominal pain. The patient had IV access problems and eventually, despite the PICC line and midlines being attempted, we were unable to complete a successful IV to finish her CAP antibiotics or the remdesivir. The patient seemed to be doing better, oxygen is 98% on room air, blood pressure 98/63 and 116/60.  We are holding the Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.  The glucose has been running at 213, 154, and 202.  BUN at 35, creatinine 1.4.  WBC 11,700 and hemoglobin 11.5. The patient was seen on the day of discharge at 1100 hours, doing quite well, and will be discharged home with her family.  We have offered visiting nurses, but she feels that the family is there 24 hours a day.  She does not need any visiting nurses.  We have made some changes to her medications, and she will need to follow up with her primary doctor in the next week to see whether we need to restart Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Will be hydrocortisone 15 mg a.m., 5 mg evening, venlafaxine 37.5 daily, venlafaxine 150 mg at bedtime, rifaximin 550 mg b.i.d., Bactrim DS 1 daily, multivitamins daily, insulin glargine 35 units at bedtime, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, NovoLog 20 units before meals.

1289925,05/05/2021,AL,34.0,34,,M,,"Event: In February, 2018 I received (in my right shoulder); my 5th anthrax shot.  The initial part of the day was typical (burning, soreness?) however, when I was traveling home my arm developed a fever. Around the injection site I developed severe swelling to the point that it looked like I had a golf ball under my skin. My arm was hot to the touch, itchy and painful. I had a large red area on my upper arm maybe the size of a softball. It remained swollen for more than 12 hours. I applied a cool rag to help with the fever. I assumed that this was not normal and I contacted the flight doc. He mentioned that it was a possible side effect and that I should continue to monitor without great concern. After about a week the area seemed to be back to normal but had a tightness to the skin. Although it was not sudden my right pinky was numb for some time and my right shoulder joint remained achy.  Fast forward 3 months later: Now at the location my arm randomly swelled up at the injection sight and became feverish again. I went and reported to the flight doc and he said again it?s normal to have reactions to the shot although it seemed odd that it was so long ago. After about 6-7 hours the sight subsided. I thought it was a one-time event.  Fast forward another 3-4 months, now post. I was at on leave and the sight became inflamed again. Although I have not been able to retrieve the picture; I remember taking a picture and sending it to the flight doc. He said it probably was not the shot but something else that I was having a reaction to.  Follow on: Pretty much 3-4 months sometimes a little longer my right shoulder will randomly get raised and itch. To the best of my knowledge I have not found any ?triggers?. The last time it happened it was a very small area maybe the size of a flat pea and the skin around the area got blotchy red and itched. Almost like when bitten by a bug.

The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.

The patient received her second Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. She had experienced tiredness, low grade temp and coughing for eight weeks at the time of the report. She had side effects from the COVID vaccine. She could go through a report but the thing she didn't think any one knew but she had a reaction 45 minutes after the second one and she was still having symptoms post 8 weeks out. She had read where it could happen post 6 weeks out but she was perfectly fine before getting it so she could not figure out what was going on. She called her work and they told her she needed a note to come back to work and she was frustrated going through a whole process and going to the doctor and no one knew anything. She needed to know what she needed to do at this point. She would like to know had this happened to anyone else, she did not think they know, the vaccine was just like the virus no one knew, and she was curious, but she thought it was just like, no one knew what was going to happen if you got it. The second dose date was 29Jan2021. She got the shot then she told the nurse she was going for a walk, and the nurse told her to hydrate well so she got a bottle water, 20 ounce and drank it on the ride home. Then on the way home, she clarified it was about 30 minutes after because she was almost home, she got nauseous. She came home, she just went straight to bed, she had body aches, headache, fever, nausea extreme fatigue, she confirmed that was the same day as the shot. Then that went on until, she had to go to Monday, so it began on that Friday at 7:30 in the morning, on Sunday she was feeling better but she was not herself. Monday morning she went to work, she wasn't having fever or nausea so she went to work, she felt pretty okay for a little bit. When asked if the symptoms were ongoing, she said it was really sporadic, which was frustrating. She said that would put her in to first week of Feb, she was not sure of the exact timeline but she was feeling pretty good. Then she was telling her dad she was having symptoms. She was having pain in her sternum randomly, it was happening multiple times per day, it had happened twice where the pain was radiating across her chest like someone was lifting her chest out of her body, it took her breath away. She was supposed to have a colonoscopy on 19Mar2021 and she was trying to decide if she should go in for that, she had no fever no other symptoms. She had to have a colonsopscopy because she had IBS with constipation and they wanted her to have a colonoscopy before they would give her medicine for that, they were going to give her Lunesta. No further information provided. She clarified the IBS was an issue for her prior to receiving the vaccine. She went in for that and she was fine that was Monday 22Feb2021 then at 9:30 that night she was laying in bed and she got severe chills, fever of 101.5, she had to take 1 Motrin and then another 2 Aleve, she thought she didn't remember for sure if that was what she took but she had to take 2 doses of medicine to get it down. No further information provided. Then the next morning she was fine. So this was still ongoing, off and on, she had had to miss work then on 31Mar2021, she was going to work everyday that previous week but the next week she was tired. She was coming home on Wednesday 31Mar2021 she was coming home from class that night because she was in school too and she was tired, her throat was hurting, it hurt to swallow, her head hurt and then, everyone was different but her temperature was 99.5, normally her temp is 97.5. She knew there was debate over whether that was a fever or not a fever not but it was not her normal. She had been taking her temperature for so long because of COVID and going to work they take temperature every day. So she was just feeling bad, she felt so bad, so she didn't go to work that day, she went to the urgent care and when she went back at the urgent care she told them she felt like, she told them she had no body aches, it was just from the neck up, like she had strep throat with a sinus infection combined and since she had gotten the COVID vaccine and the flu shot they did not think it was that but she decided to test her for strep and flu, they did not think it was covid becuase she works at a hospital she did not think she had it either but since she was presenting with symptoms they tested for that too and all that was negative so she thought maybe it's viral, they do have a lot going around and it is the season for allergies with pollen or it maybe a viral sinus infection, that was on Thursday, she slet Friday Saturday and still Sunday and the whole time she was still having like a 99.5 fever by the end of the day so Sunday she was supposed to go back to work. The 31Mar2021 she started feeling really bad and she went to the urgent care 01Apr2021 and had those tests done that were negative and she was home Thursday and the weekend she was not back to herself she was tired but she was not having symptoms COVID but like with her sinuses allowed to use Afrin for 3 days 3 times per day and then stop so she did that then developed a dry cough and by the end of week Sunday she couldn't talk without coughing every time she opened her mouth and air touched her throat she would cough. She didn't know date of that it was not this past Sunday, but the Sunday before she went back to urgent care and they did a chest x-ray and retested for covid, they gave her an Albuterol treatment, they told her there was nothing in her chest and wrote script for a Zpack if she needed it. No further information provided. Then Monday of last week she called her allergist and went to see the allergist and she told her she was not breathing right there was something in there like a bronchial spasm was what she called it and she said everything looked angry, like her ears and her throat. She was not sure why. Her allergist gave her a Z pack, nothing against urgent care but she wanted to get the prescription from her doctor. This had been going on so long so last Wednesday she got the z-pack she left work early at 2 PM and slept for Wednesday through Friday, she did not shower at all she was just exhausted and she was just not feeling well. The cough did get better with a prescription cough drop that she could use 3 times per day for 10 days and her cough was a lot better not totally gone but nothing like it was that Wednesday night. Saturday she was better enough and took a shower and got up and did not feel horrible, she was still tired still, but then Sunday, yesterday, she had a low grade fever at night and was tired and had pain. She said they gave her Prednisone at the urgent care too when she got the chest Xray and on Prednisone didn't feel any aches at all like her knees did not hurt. She went to see the allergist and she was off the Prednisone and everything started hurting, her jaw, her head. She said they told her it was not very much Prednisone but she could find the information. She said it was the 5 day pack. She had to get her glasses. She said it was in a box, its the tapered one, where you do 5 tablets. Yesterday she was still not herself. She took today off again. She was going to call over the weekend they weren't open. But they told her at work she would need a note to come back and she told them her concerns and they said that was not possible and she told them they didn't know, no one really knew. It was a hot mess because she had been getting fatigue and tired and having a low grade fever. She saw 9 patients in a day. She had not called out, she had the flu 5 years prior to the report and she had not been out sick since then so something happened. They told her to go to her primary and she just did not know.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6198, vaccine product manufacture date 24Feb2021 ) intramuscularly in arm (for route of administration: Caller stated the shoulder, caller forgot whether left or right, clarified as shoulder muscle. Caller thought it was in the left shoulder muscle but stated don't hold him to it. Caller said he was picturing himself sitting down, but didn't remember if its the right or left arm) on 17Mar2021 13:20 at age of 75-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, two bouts with cancer, heart attack, pneumonia years ago (He said it was 3 or 4 weeks in the hospital when the caller had pneumonia, Caller clarified he was in the hospital for at least 4 weeks and home for 3 or 4 weeks, that's how bad caller's pneumonia was. Also the fact the caller is 75 years old, so basically caller's age and immune system) and a lot of health issues. Other medical history included gastritis. When relevant family medical history was queried caller said it was just like caller said, the pain was just constant. He could not take any kind of Aspirin, Advil or anything like that because caller has severe gastritis. Caller may try something topical cream to see if it would help or not. Caller stated he had Atypical Neuralgia and had not taken anything for the leg pain. Caller's stomach was extremely sensitive to any type of medication. The only medication the caller took is for blood pressure. If he took any medication it hits his gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal and central nervous system so he didn't take any prescribed medications other than Atenolol for blood pressure, once a day. Caller took Valium as needed for severe costochondritis, stated between the ribs was cartilage, the Valium was taken as needed. No further information provided. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Prior vaccinations included: the patient has had Prevnar 13 shots and had other, been a long time ago, had vaccinations in past for tetanus, Prevnar 13, pneumonia, normal flu shot every year that kind of stuff. Caller confirms he has not had any adverse event after a vaccination. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Caller stated he knew better than to have any other vaccinations. It was days before that, it was like on a Sunday, caller got an allergy shot, but they said allergy shot was not considered a vaccination. It was an allergy shot for dust, mold, histamines. Caller stated he may have skipped the allergy shot, confirmed caller did not receive the allergy shot. Shot was for mold, histamines and pollen, not a vaccination. No vaccines for flu or Pneumonia or anything else. The patient had problems a week after the first shot of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, which was already reported to Safety. She had severe muscle pain, soreness and weakness in both legs from thighs to calves all the way down to ankles; not just the typical muscle pain, tiredness, nausea that lasts a day or so. On 24Mar2021, she started experiencing muscle pain and it has gotten progressively worse. She was not sure if she will get the second shot but she would beyond the 42 days; it's been about 6 weeks and didn't have an appointment with her rheumatologist until June.The patient talked to a nurse in the FDA. The nurse said there was no time limit to receive second dose Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Although, when the vaccination first came out caller was told the second dose Pfizer COVID Vaccine should be given no more than 6-8 weeks and the nurse was telling the caller the second dose could be given months later. Caller's first question, if caller decided to go the second dose Pfizer COVID Vaccine was there any time frame between doses that the caller would have to start over again with the Pfizer Covid Vaccinations. Caller received the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 17Mar2021 and was not sure if he will get the second dose because he was experiencing a little bit of a problem and was not sure if it is related to the Pfizer Covid Vaccine dose one or not, caller stated he would get to that. He has a couple doctors appointments, so if they rule it out. Severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs: Caller reported he was having severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs began about a week after receiving first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine. He knew most of the shots they say that you may experience muscle pain nausea and all that. That's basically it. Caller stated it is a throbbing, sharp pain that was 24/7 and it begun happening within a week after got the first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Experiencing muscle pain in both legs, to thigh to calves to the ankles, 24/7, not coming and going. Caller stated ever since a week from 17Mar2021 this has been happening from 24Mar2021 to the date of report. Severe muscle pain, soreness, weakness in both legs. If caller bends down, he had to put his arm on something to pull himself up. Sharp pain, throbbing, sore and if you pressed down on leg, made it even worse. If the leg was touched anywhere it was just really sore and tender and kind of like a sharp pain. Sharp pain wasn't as bad as the soreness. Extremely sore and tender 24/7 and hadn't stopped since 24Mar2021. About the time period it started and hasn't let up since then. If caller did any kind of work, trying to get muscles back in shape with exercise helps, but if caller did anything putzing around and pulling weeds, bending down exacerbates the problem. Any kind of activity exacerbates the problem greatly. Caller never had this kind of muscle pain. Severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs: Caller reported he was sore in his legs especially the thigh and calf area, down around ankles not too bad. But the thigh and the calf muscles are extremely sore and painful. Caller sated has not gotten any better, if anything may have gotten a little worse. Same or maybe a little worse, honestly, when first came on just felt like a little bit of muscle pain. Initial onset to now it has gotten worse, it hadn't gotten worse in the last few weeks. The pain was bad lets put it that way. Caller guesses the biggest thing it has a major impact on is his quality of life. Caller has gotten different surgeries and stuff and been able to move on. However, with this the caller was lucky to be able to do anything for half an hour to an hour and then he just has to sit down. Caller stated it was having a major impact on caller's quality of life. Caller like to have gone but doctor ordered blood work, didn't want caller to be exposed. Caller was holding off going to emergency room, didn't want exposure of going to the emergency room.

Medical history included cancer from 2018 (started out with BCG treatments, where they insert bacteria into the bladder); Had another form of immunotherapy that didn't work too well for him and the cancer kept growing chemotherapy; Had a couple of operations and surgeries where the doctor removed it all but it came back. Best reaction was chemotherapy (It stopped the bleeding and was working on the cancer). Last one was 15Feb2021. Was getting blood work for every treatment. Had to miss one of the treatments due to low platelets. Has a chest port for treatments and blood work.  Was very conscious before having chemo. It is kind of a rough thing to kill cancer but also kills good cells too. Definitely worked on killing the cancer for a while; the last treatment was 15Feb2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo.

Wife had no symptoms, maybe a bit of a sore arm and he had the same reaction. Was a very mild sore arm in 2021. On day 2 or 3 on the right side of the neck, had felt a little nagging in Mar2021 and slight pain, especially when he moved and felt it around his back. It is just starting to go away now at 3 weeks. Around the back, around the perimeter and when he coughs in Mar2021, he can feel it in his chest. He is scheduled for the second shot. Is wondering if the second shot will have those symptoms. It's not like it is anything severe, it is just nagging. What worries is him, is that it lasted this long. Is a cancer patient and had last chemotherapy 15Feb2021. His oncologist said to go ahead and take the shot because he really needs the protection. It was asked what if he has the same reaction again. Will go on website but wanted to find out what other people are experiencing and whether or not to take the second shot. Wants to take it for protection. Really wants to take the shot on Tuesday. Pain in neck and back: Only when he coughs, is more of an ache. Started day 2 after vaccine on 28Mar2021. Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck in Mar2021. Was probably the lymph node in Mar2021.  Pain in chest: When he sneezes in Mar2021, there is a sharp pain, all around the perimeter of his chest. Is gone as soon as he stops coughing. Feels when muscles are contracting in Mar2021. Started day 3 after getting the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer, which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system. Wants to be put on immunotherapy but can't until he is finished with his shots. If he gets the immunotherapy and if he has a reaction, would have to use steroids and they do not want to do that with the vaccine. The doctor wanted to start him earlier on the immunotherapy but thought it was important to get the vaccine first, that taken care of.  The pain is only sharp if he lifts something. Otherwise, it is just dull. He knows it is there. It is not completely gone. This morning was the best that he had. Really got good sleep last night. The best since it has happened. When he sneezes, he can kind of feel it around his chest, just around the perimeter of the muscles. Treatment: The first couple of days, just put up with it. Took Tylenol one day and then on another day. Takes at bedtime. Does not like taking Tylenol because it effects his liver. If he doesn't need it, he doesn't take it. In the last week, every night he has been less and less bothered by how he slept. Last night he didn't even know he had it, the pain, and slept really well. Have not taken any meds, just Tylenol on day 4 and 5 to help sleep. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events.
