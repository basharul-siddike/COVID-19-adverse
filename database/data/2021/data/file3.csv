I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this.

I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen.

0933101,01/10/2021,OH,29.0,29,,M,,"Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.",,,,,,,,Y,N,12/31/2020,12/31/2020,0,"MRI SHOULDER RIGHT - Details  Study Result Impression 1.

I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.

Proceeded through my day and it persevered.  After lunch, still felt short of breath. Contacted Infection Control nurse and was advised to leave work as it was also a COVID symptom.

Bump at injection site gone completely (I massaged it Thursday and Friday). Minor discomfort with breathing; barely noticeable. In the afternoon time around 2pm, sudden and urgent diarrhea that lasted into the evening hours at bed.  Top of stomach burning (inside body). Diarrhea stopped, but nausea remained.

It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn't sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it's GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue.

This case involves an 85-year-old female patient who was not feeling well, had no energy (asthenia) was being exhausted (fatigue), had abdominal problems like diarrhea (diarrhoea) and discomfort in the stomach (abdominal discomfort) and later was diagnosed with possible colitis (colitis), after she received INFLUENZA QUADRIVAL A-B HIGH DOSE HV VACCINE [FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE QUADRIVALENT].  The patient's past vaccination included influenza vaccine (first flu vaccine) and she experienced the injection site swelling to the size of a tennis ball and the arm stayed swollen for 4 days. She did not had a reaction since the first flu vaccine.  The patient's past medical treatment(s) and family history were not provided. The patient had no other vaccines.  At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing lactose intolerance and had to avoid rich cream sauces.

The patient wanted to know possible side effects from getting Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent due to the adverse events she experienced. It was reported that this pharmacy gave people over 65-years of age the Fluzone High dose and did not tell them. The patient would have preferred the standard dose due to being sensitive to medications. The colitis may be due to other factors and the caller was just tracing her steps. She had recently moved into a new retirement community and was now getting served meals which consist of foods she had avoided in the past, the foods consist of fried foods that were usually not in her diet.  No laboratory data was provided.  Final diagnosis was possible colitis.  It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.

The patient's historical vaccine included influenza virus vaccine in 2017 after which the patient developed severe flu symptoms and was under a lot of stress at the time (see case 202009088).   On 07-Nov-2020, the patient was vaccinated with Fluad Quadrivalent vaccine (influenza vaccine, inactivated influenza virus surface antigen (subunit), egg-derived, mf59; route of administration: intramuscular, anatomical location: right arm, dose and indication: not reported). The batch number reported was 279796.  On 08-Nov-2020, one day after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, the patient experienced hives, welts at the injection area (red, sore, hot to touch area about size of a hand), pain from elbow to shoulder. She had no fever; body temperature was 98 degrees Fahrenheit. Size of redness increased over time and pain progressed to wrist and to top of the neck.   On 10-Nov-2020 in the evening, the patient went to urgent care and was given a prescription for cephalexin for 10 days and told she had cellulitis from the flu vaccination being given too low on the arm (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine administered at inappropriate site').  On 11-Nov-2020, the next morning, the patient saw primary care physician (PCP) and would follow up with PCP after finishing course of antibiotics.   At the time of initial reporting, the patient had not recovered from the events, as she had taken two doses of cephalexin and symptoms remained.   The reporter did not provide a causality assessment, but the urgent care stated that the cellulitis was from flu vaccination.   The event of 'cellulitis' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  The case is linked to the case 202009088 (the same patient).  Company comment: A 74-year-old patient was administered Fluad Quadrivalent. One day after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, the patient experienced hives, welts at the injection area (red, sore, hot to touch area about size of a hand), pain from elbow to shoulder. The patient went to urgent care and was given a prescription for cephalexin for 10 days and told she had cellulitis from the flu vaccination being given too low on the arm. Vaccine administered at inappropriate site is assessed as not related per company's conventions. Causality is assessed as possibly related for vaccination site urticaria, urticaria and cellulitis. Per Brighton collaboration criteria, presented information correspond to level 2 diagnostic certainty for cellulitis at injection site.; Reporter's Comments: The urgent care stated that the cellulitis was from flu vaccination.; Sender's Comments: A 74-year-old patient was administered Fluad Quadrivalent.

In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and ""buzzing"" throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled.

He got the vaccine after waiting three and half hours in line and they went off, last night that would be Sunday night, several hours later he noticed an odd sensation and did not really take a look at it, he thought he had a mosquito bite perhaps as they live in (place name withheld) and they live in the land that has lots of mosquito, so he didn't pay too much attention to it. Approximately four hours after the injection, he was going to go to bed and removed his shirt and found that the area on the opposite side of his body, on the left hand side he noticed that there were several small pustules, the area was raised it was red it was warm, it was on the opposite side under his arm on his chest he was extremely uncomfortable. It was very, very itchy and the area felt like it got itself swollen and he shared with his wife, the wife suggested that he contact the physician of course he didn't contact, his primary physician said he can see a dermatologist and sent images and yesterday he went to see a dermatologist, so prophylactically he took the 25 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and also 2 acetaminophen (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and he treated the pain and itching with ice. He slept with an ice bag and woke up just in morning and in New Year they were able to see a dermatologist, he thought it was dermatological. He was concerned but not overly concerned with the area pretty swollen. He saw a dermatologist yesterday, and gave him a topical treatment, the dermatologist gave him three different, naproxene (NAPROSYN), the other one is Triamcinolone Acetonide cream now the irritation he got the MUPIROCIN ointment now as the dermatoligist told him to do, continue what he was doing as he was comfortable, The dermatologist took some specimens from the pustules and send them to lab and she (doctor) is not sure whether or not he might get a staph infection, a viral infection he was not sure. Initially there was an area under his left arm which is very swollen it appeared to be filled with fluid of some type, he was not sure what was it. He thought it was edema but when he popped it, it felt very much like fluid not like blood but it is some type of fluid filled area most likely his wife said the size are greater and less that it was yesterday and that seems to go down over the last night but not all the way it's decreased by what 20%, 30%, 40% he can't tell, alright 50% but now he has it under under right arm, it's probably impacting his lymph system and he put a call into his cardiologist.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021.

Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there's tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don't have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn't feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn't leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn't tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn't feel right.

Both were from multi-dose vials and providers I established care with following the reaction believed I likely had a reaction to a preservative. I?ve received single-dose flu vaccines with no issues since then. When I received the Moderna covid vaccine on 1/8/21 I had some right-sided throat swelling about 15 minutes after injection. It did not worsen and I was monitored for 1 hour after shot time. I went home and the feeling in my throat resolved after about 4-5 hours with no medication or intervention needed. I did not have any other symptoms until 3pm on 1/9/21. Started with mild abdominal pain, an hour and a half later I had chills, headache, fatigue and fever around 100.8F. No medication taken. The fever resolved within about 6-7 hours. On Sunday 1/10/21 the abdominal pain worsened and was a constant pain around umbilical region that felt as if it radiated outward, LLQ slightly worse. It was severe, directly affected normal daily functions. I could not walk, move, eat or drink room-temp water without pain increasing.  Walking 20ft at one point even caused me to crumble to the floor and cry, had to stay there for 5 minutes before even attempting to get back to the couch. No diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, no nausea. I did have loss of appetite. The pain continued through the night and was constant. I could not find a comfortable position to lay in and tossed and turned most of the night. At 0430 on 1/11/21 I got up out of bed to pee, abdominal pain was so bad it kept me awake for about an hour after. Pain finally started to improve and I was able to sleep from 0530-0930. When I woke up on 1/11/21 around 0930 my abdominal pain was very mild and continued to improve as the day went on. Currently (1600 on 1/11/21) my abdomen feels about 90% better, I have no other symptoms.
