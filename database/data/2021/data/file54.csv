I tried 4 Advil and 2 Tylenol at maximal doses, simultaneously, for the last 2 days and it has barely helped.  Last night, 4/18/2021, the headache was so severe I got nauseous but never vomited. I was shakey. I took my blood pressure with a wrist monitor and it was 160/105. (My normal BP is about 120/80). I took my BP four times and it was about the same, around 155 or 160 systolic over 110-105 diastolic.  The headache was so severe I nearly went to the ER.   Today (4/19/21) I took 2 Excedrin Migraine tabs at about noon. It might have helped a little. I'm VERY concerned about getting the second vaccine. I have postponed it from the originally-scheduled date of 4/23/21 to 5/8/21 in the hopes that the headaches will ease up. I spoke with my doctor (an MD), a relative who is a DO, and two pharmacists. Everyone agrees that postponing the second vaccine might help. One pharmacist suggested that I might consider not getting the second vaccine; however I want as much protection from Covid as possible. I am very concerned, though, that the headaches and accompanying lightheadedness could last a long time.  A further note: when I started HRT in Sept 2019, I got severe headaches and had to discontinue the meds after just one week. The headaches lasted SIX FULL MONTHS after discontinuing the hormones.

The caller had a known allergy to thimerosal. She had an allergic reaction to a flu vaccine but does not know which manufacturer's vaccine it was that caused the reaction. At the time, it was thought her allergic reaction happened due to her thimerosal allergy because even though the outer package of the vaccine she received indicated ""thimerosal free"", it was later found in the package insert that the product contained a millimicron of thimerosal. She did not have information about what presentation but thinks it was possible that it was from a single dose vial. She summarized that she had only reacted to two types of vaccines in her lifetime. She had reacted mildly with itching to DTP vaccines. She did not receive any more flu vaccines until in 2007 and at that time went into the hospital. She avoided reactions because that entire time she thought it was thimerosal she was allergic to, and as long as she would avoid thimerosal, she thought she was okay. But she did note that her allergist did not believe that thimerosal causes allergic reactions of the type that she experienced.  The details of laboratory data were not reported.

He stated he made sure to have something to eat and drink beforehand and was aware that it may happen following this vaccine as well. Prior to administering vaccine, I verified details with patient on previous episodes and discussed risks with patient, who understood and wished to proceed anyways and was okay staying additional time beyond 15 mins post vaccination to ensure no serious reaction. Immediately post-vaccination, I asked the patient how they were feeling prior to sending him to the designated waiting area. He stated repeatedly that he was fine and okay to walk to the chairs on his own. Moments after sitting down, a technician alerted me that he had collapsed off the chair and fell on the ground before anyone could get there to catch him. I immediately called 911 and attended to the patient who had already regained consciousness while I was on the phone with emergency services. He informed technician that when he sat down he felt a little queasy and the next thing he knew, he was on the floor. Fortunately there happened to be an EMT in the store that came over to help while waiting for additional paramedics. We provided the patient with an ice pack and a bottle of water, but instructed him not to drink anything until paramedics arrived. We checked the patients blood pressure and found the reading to be low and patient was tachycardic, expected following a syncopal episode. Myself and the EMT got patient to lie down on the floor and elevated his head. We noticed that the patient had suffered a small laceration to his head resulting from falling off the chair onto the ground. Store management also got involved to assess the situation and take statements. Upon arrival of paramedics, care was transferred over to them. At first, patient refused to be transported to the hospital but asked that we contact his mother.

Per the patient, after she had left the site, she began to feel short of breath and instructed her husband to drive her back for evaluation.  Patient complained of intermittent tightness in her upper chest and brief periods of difficult breathing.  Report below per physician on-site.   4/19/2020 11:48am  This morning, I attended a 43 year old accompanied by her significant other. They returned to the Center after she received her 1st Moderna Covid-19 vaccination here about 40 mins prior. She complained of an intermittent tightness in her upper chest and felt she was having brief periods of trouble breathing. She denied tongue swelling, wheezing, pruritis, or rash. She did not take any medications after her vaccination. She noted a distant (20+ years ago) of a food allergy to ?seeds? that required transport to a hospital and what sounds to me that she had epinephrine administered at that time. She has not had another severe allergic reaction since but notes seasonal allergies and takes Allegra and uses an inhaler PRN. She does not have these medicines with her. On exam, she is sitting on the cot in the EMS tent. She is in no acute distress and is speaking in full sentences. There is no urticaria, no tongue swelling, no stridor, and no voice changes. She is not tripoding and there is no increased work of breathing. Her left radial pulse is strong, steady, and not tachycardic nor bradycardic. Her pulse oximetry was 95-98%. I informed her that at the time, I feel that close observation in warranted and she and her significant other agreed to stay to be observed. Shortly after this, she was observed to sit up, hold her upper chest and cough with slight stridor. This only lasted a few seconds and then resolved. Several minutes later, this happened again. I informed her that I felt that caution was advised with her history of a severe allergic reaction and intermittent upper airway signs. I recommended that she be observed in a hospital setting for her safety. She agreed and the Fire Department was contacted through 911.  When the paramedics arrived, she stated she was feeling much better. There were no longer any upper airway signs/symptoms. She declined transportation by ambulance to the hospital. I observed her for an additional ~10 mins and she continued to be asymptomatic. She was again offered transport to the hospital by ambulance and again declined. She sated she would like to go home with her significant other who would be with her to watch for any worsening signs//symptoms. I strongly recommended that if developed any upper airway signs such as feeling her throat is closing, tongue swelling, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms she should immediately call 911 as these may indicate a life-threatening emergency. She and her significant other indicated that they understood my instructions and agreed to abide by these recommendations.  I asked her to discuss her reaction with her primary provider before receiving another dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

I feel it important to inform you of this event in order to prevent this event from happing to others. We feel your form is not user friendly and does not lend itself to the reporting a COVID Vaccination event. It does not address reporting both dose information and does not provide sufficient space to describe a complicated event. I will attempt to fill in the items that were left blank as follows: Patient and My Thoughts:  We believe my vascular occlusion was caused by my Phizer vaccination, the time line and other problems of blood clots caused by other manufactures led me to believe so. When in the hospital some doctors thought it might be true, and many of my medical friends also agree with me. I am in the process of making an appointment with a hematologist, and hope that he may have insight to my blood clot problem. I feel you should investigate my event in order to save others, I am lucky to survive this event and do not know what future issues lay ahead for me. Regards:  Patient Time Line of Events Vascular Occlusion April 1, 2021  February 13-First Dose Coivd 19 Vaccination Phizer EC9269 at County Clinic Site  March 3 -Second Dose Covid 19 Vaccination Phizer EN6198 at County Clinic Site  March 11- Pedicure-Complained that it hurt, later that evening had pain in right hip and down leg to calf, pain became progressivity worse.  March 20- Pain in the right leg. Went to walk in Clinic, advised doctor of past pulmonary embolism. Because it was Saturday, they were unable to x ray, suggested we go to emergency. At the emergency we asked the doctor if there was a possibility of a blood clot. His reply was no, a very small percentage chance, less than 1% chance because of taking Elquis. The doctor stated he could order a ultura sound test for blood clots, but it would be a waste of time and money to do so but he could do so if we wanted. We requested he do the test, we wanted to know that there were no clots present. After the test, the doctor stated I told you so, no clots present. A cat scan was made, herniated disk present, a condition we knew was present. The problem was diagnosed as scintica nerve issue. Was given a shot for pain, prescription for steroids and Lidocaine patch written. Discharged with instructions for treatment. When at home the pain continued and progressively became worse, decided that I needed to return to the emergency site.  March 29- Returned to emergency. Doctor suspected that I had a herniated disc (sciatica) after hearing all my systems. The doctor stated the only way that he could be certain of his suspicions would be to have a MRI, I elected not to have it done today. The doctor encouraged me to follow up with my primary care physician (I did not have one) for further treatment. Also suggested that I could make an appointment for pain management. I made a appointment Internal Medicine for April 1st. Prescriptions written for acetaminophen, cyelobenzaprine, naproxen, discharge instructions given and discharged.  April 1st-In the morning, preparing for my appointment with internal group at 11am, after my shower, I could not walk on my left leg, I felt the pain was at a 10 level. like my leg was in a vise, the pain was higher than 10 if possible, maybe a 30, then I told my husband that he should call 911. My husband was like a deer in a head light, very confused, I had to tell two additional times before he did so. The 911 Fire Truck arrived in approximately ten minutes, ambulance shortly after. I was transported to the emergency facility. Upon arrival the doctor examined me and felt that I might have an aneurysm. Meds were given, I was then transported by ambulance, right light and siren to the Hospital Emergency, the nurse from the emergency facility traveled with me.  Upon arrival I was examined immediately and was given a CT Angiography, and it was determined that I had vascular occlusion with a white foot. Dr., a Vascular Surgeon told me that I needed immediate surgery to remove extensive intraluminal thrombus in the thoracic, proximal abdominal aorta as well as in the bilateral profunda femoris artery, as well as the femoral arteries, superficial femoral arteries, popliteal arteries with single vessel runoff present to the right ankle and no definite flow identified in the left runoff vessel. After a 4 Hr. surgery and recovery I was transferred to the CCU unit staying there for two days, transfer to a normal room and discharged on April 4th. My care throughout stay and treatment was excellent, beyond my expeditions, the staff and doctors are great! Hospital is exceptional.  Additional Thoughts of Husband- My wife has been very healthy throughout our marriage of 57 years. The discovery of Brest Cancer in 2018, successfully treated, and her Pulmonary Embolism in 2019 and near-death experience also successfully treated as an eye opener to me. When the events of April 1st happened, I was overwhelmed, what is going on, I thought wife's sciatica diagnosis could be causing pain, but not to the extent to call 911, maybe I should take her back to Emergency. Thank God she was correct in telling me to call 911. The issue I have is why did she have Vascular Occlusion? Blood clots can not happen when taking Eliquis, I have been told that by Medical friends in addition to physicians. All of these opinions have ruled out blood clots in my mind and could have caused me to be responsible for my wife's death, thank God again.  I wonder if the COVID-19 Vaccination could be a cause. I have searched this thought and found many articles stating blood clots a side effect with people with Covid. Also there have been blood clot side effects with vaccinations such as in AstraZeneca. My fear is will blood clots return. I wonder will we ever know what caused wife's issue. I would encourage physicians not to discount the possibility of blood clots being present no matter what medicine is being taken. I feel we were in the right place when this event happened, thank God that were. The Doctors, Nurses at the hospital have saved my wife's life, and I am grateful for their care.  April-4 Discharged Hospital. Discharge papers written 11 pages.  April-6 Home visitation. Field ed out paperwork and took vitals  April-9 Visited Dr DO at Physician Group. Described the events of 4/1/2021. Doctor examined, took vitals, and wrote prescriptions. Patient and I were very comfortable and pleased with her deminer and knowledge.

The tinnitus alternates between loudness of 2-7, at worst its a high pitched ringing noise, at best its a hissing noise. Often also a whistling noise, crackling noise, sleigh bell noise, occasionally pulsatile.  Also have increased anxiety due to the tinnitus.

The patient's rheumatological symptoms were controlled by a combination of methotrexate weekly and rituximab every six months since 2008.

In 2017, the patient was referred by an otolaryngologist for an immunological evaluation because his chronic pansinusitis did not resolve with septoplasty and bilateral sinus surgery followed by several rounds of clarithromycin.

Needed to use the bathroom and try to move to improve circulation and had to think about moving my body. I was not uncoordinated but my steps and balance were deliberate vs. unconscious and automatic. I was able to walk down the aisle to the lavatory without any problem but my vision did not immediately improve as I had hoped.  I went into the lavatory and leaned against the side (I'm 6'4"" and it was the rear lavatory on a 737). I was not dizzy and my lightheadedness began to clear up slowly as I urinated. The color was also coming back slowly as I finished up and walked back to my seat, again, I had to think about each step and my balance, although I was okay walking back. As soon as I sat down, I began sweating profusely. It lasted about two minutes or less, not long at all and I didn't get wet from the sweat. As suddenly as the sweat came, it went. My eyesight went back to normal and I felt nothing had happened. I am sure I was awake, aware and lucid the entire time, although it felt like what I imagine a psychedelic episode would be like (I've never used any form of hallucinogen, however). I was back to normal when I disembarked the aircraft, felt no adverse or lingering effects either.

Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.

I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.

By midnight, I felt much better and assumed everything was over.   03/29: Woke up feeling fairly tired. As I was trying to do my normal morning routine of cleaning up, taking out trash, etc. I noticed a shortness of breath. No fever or other symptoms from the night before. I checked my SPo2 levels with 3 different oximeters, and all gave readings in the 93%-94% range. My heart rate, which is usually in the 80s and 90s when moving about, was in the low 70s, bottoming at 72. This was nerve racking. This along with intermittent dizziness persisted for 24 hours. I got COVID tested and it came back negative. Flu came back negative, too. A consult with a doctor inferred that ""everyone has different vaccine side effects."" Not helpful.   This shortness of breath/fatigue/low blood oxygen saturation continued persistently for the next 48 hours. I was essentially advised to stay home and rest. I noticed some lymph node swelling, too.   By day 4, I was feeling much better. My heart rate had gone back up into the 80s, and my blood oxygen sat. had increased to 96-97%. I was still somewhat tired and got winded very, very easily.   It's been over two weeks since my second shot upon writing this. I didn't want to report, but I can't make heads or tails as to why this happened. The only change in my health was taking the vaccine. I don't have any blood clots, asthma, or underlying issues. However, these side effects, if they are as such, need to be discussed. I know others who got the Moderna vaccine with similar anecdotes.

1232654,04/20/2021,CA,54.0,54,,M,,"I had previously had COVID during the first week of January 2021 and recovered.  During that time, I had lost about 80% of my sense of smell which I still have not regained.  But at time, I never has any loss of taste.  However, immediately after receiving the vaccination I noticed an altered sense of taste.  I would describe it as almost all of my sense of taste is gone but actually everything I eat has a rancid taste.  Some foods cause the bad taste more than others.  Some foods I used to love now bring out the worst after taste such as peanut butter.  The more bland the food usually results in less ""bad"" taste.  But overall I can't really taste the actual taste of any food.  And to make it worse, before when I couldn?t smell, it was bearable, but now most of the same foods that taste bad also have the same rancid odor I smell also.  So to summarize, I now can?t really taste or smell anything except for the rancid taste and odor the food has.  It is amazingly challenging as people don?t understand when I describe it to them that almost all food smells and tastes bad since that isn?t just loss of taste.  As of today, it has now been over 3 weeks since my vaccination and I don't see any improvement yet.  I did recently (about 2 week ago) have full lab work done as part of an annual checkup and all results came back normal.  So now I have reduced smell from COVID and loss of taste from the vaccine.  I don?t see any other explanation than that the vaccine caused this new phenomenon.  It could has something to do with the fact that I previously had COVID.  I am hesitant to even go to the doctor since I am certain they will have no idea what to do.",,,,,,,,,N,03/29/2021,03/30/2021,1,None,PVT,,Atorvistatin,None,None,,,2,04/20/2021,,,,None

The 911 operator continued to ask questions about the patient's status and stated to not give any water or medications. I continued to assess the patient's symptoms. Her vision improved; however, she continued to feel light-headed, nauseous, and having trouble breathing. A member of EMS was in the store and came over to assess the patient. He had the patient sit up but she continued to have the same symptoms. He assessed her IMZ site. She was not feeling itchy and had not developed any hives. The ambulance arrived.

I saw a PA in my primary care physician's office. She looked at my arm, the injection site, and compared both of my arms to see if it appeared swollen. She said everything looked fine, told me it was okay to take ibuprofen and alternate with Tylenol, and said the pain should go away in a week or so. The pain never went away, but honestly I kept holding out hope because after insurance I owed $124 for that doctor visit and it wasn't very helpful. I couldn't spend any more money for another pointless visit.  But the pain has increased. Simple things like removing my shirt without assistance almost brings me to tears. Using my left arm while driving has become more painful, and I struggle to move in certain directions.

My arm had and dead weight feeling to it and I could barely move it I started panicking. I tried to calm down but I couldn't stop thinking how abnormal it felt. I have tried to relax it because I was theorizing it could be from inflammation (sort of like a trigger finger affect). It's very upsetting because the feeling hasn't gone away. I can move my arm and hands and fingers better now but I still have this tingly feeling in my funny bone radiating to my armpit and down to my finger tips especially my pinky and ring finger. My muscles keep tightening in my forearm. I will see a doctor as soon as possible.  To go into more detail: It feels like there is a rubber band around my funny bone area, like my funny bone is constantly being hit. A constant buzz. It is hard for me to move my pinky and ring finger on my hand, the best way to describe it is sort of like a numbness and those two fingers move together more now. My coordination is off.

The patient noted that the arm just kept getting worse (continued progression of swelling with small itchy bumps that popped and oozed fluid, developed pain in left elbow with severe swelling. Lesions were painful to touch). Was visiting with her PCM every Monday and saw her multiple times who gave her an ?antibiotic cream? which the patient reports she could not use because it was too large of an area.

She had taken two doses of doxycycline and three doses of Atarax before heading to the ED once again on 15MAR2021.   15MAR2021: Came to the ED again after noticing at work that her face was red and her tongue was swelling in the back of the throat. She was driven to the ED by her husband. She was given an EpiPen in the ED quickly. Her heart rate became fast, she reported, but the EpiPen resolved her itching of the face/neck, the redness dissipated, and her tongue felt ?back to normal.? She also received Solumedrol 125mg IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and 1L normal saline. Several hours later, her tongue swelling and face itching and red rash returned, and she received an additional EpiPen IM injection and then Valium 5mg PO which resolved her symptoms and helped calm her down. She was then admitted for 2 nights in the step down for observation. She reports this was an unremarkable admission and she felt fine after the second EpiPen injection. The only symptom she reported was a bad headache the whole admission which was not relieved well with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. She said she had some peeling of skin on her left arm as well.   17MAR2021: Discharged home, headache persisted. Rash on face/neck and tongue swelling was completely gone.

Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn't feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities.

Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Chest X-ray 3/20: 20:22 Lungs: Lung volumes are low. There are bibasilar opacities, compatible with atelectasis. No focal consolidation. Heart/mediastinum: Cardiac contours are obscured, but likely top normal in size. Pleural effusion: None. Pneumothorax: None. Osseous/soft tissue structures: Normal. Included upper abdomen: Gas distended bowel loops in the left upper quadrant are partially imaged.  CT angiogram 3/20 22:48 There is somewhat suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary arterial system. Scattered areas of subsegmental pulmonary embolus seen in bilateral lower lobes, for example right lower lobe at series 2 images 122,112 and left lower lobe at series 2 image 130. No large central pulmonary embolus. No right heart strain. Heart is normal on this non-gated CTA study.  The lung volumes are low. There is a triangular shaped subpleural opacity in the anterior right middle lobe (series 3 image 64, series 401 image 95) likely representing a pulmonary infarct. Scattered areas of linear atelectasis also seen in the lingula and anterior aspect of left upper lobe. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. There are at least 3 bilateral lung nodules identified as below: 1.5 mm oblong nodule in the right upper lobe, better appreciated on sagittal images (series 401 image 68, series 3 image 29). This appears to be along the bronchovascular bundle. 2.5 mm right peri fissural triangular nodule (series 3 image 51) 3.5 mm left peri fissural nodule (series 3 image 48). 1.7 x 1.1 cm subpleural bleb in the posterior aspect of right lower lobe (series 3 image 70). Pleura: There is minimal right right apical pleural thickening (posterior aspect of right upper lobe series 3 image 33). A small right and trace left pleural effusions are seen. Large airways are normal. No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is seen. Few prominent bilateral axillary lymph nodes seen measuring up to 10 mm on left side (series 2 image 52). Visualized thyroid appears normal. r A small hiatal hernia is seen. Otherwise visualized portions of the upper abdomen are normal. Osseous structures are normal.  Lower extremity U/S: 3/21 18:46pm All visualized veins are patent, without intraluminal thrombus. Spectral Doppler imaging demonstrates normal venous waveforms.  Upper extremity U/S: 3/21 FINDINGS: Mid and distal third of right subclavian vein (mid and lateral aspect of right subclavian vein) is seen as multiple vascular channels which could represent collateralization.  Two discrete channels identified in the location of left internal jugular vein which also could represent collateralization. Rest of the visualized veins are patent, without intraluminal thrombus. Spectral Doppler imaging demonstrates normal venous waveforms.    IMPRESSION: 1.Questionable lateralization of the mid and lateral aspect of right subclavian vein and also left internal jugular vein. Consider CT/MR or conventional venogram to assess for characterization and confirmation. 2.No acute thrombus visualized in the rest of the upper extremity veins.  Echocardiogram on 3/22: ? Technically difficult examination due to suboptimal echocardiographic windows. ? No right ventricle dilation and no evidence for elevated right ventricular pressure though right ventricular pressure cannot be  estimated due to insufficient tricuspid regurgitation. ? Qualitatively normal valve function. ? Qualitatively normal left ventricular function. ? Right ventricle not seen well enough to assess function but short axis images suggest that mildly reduced systolic function may be  present.

Within about 5 seconds, I started feeling nauseated and light headed like I was going to pass out.  I asked to just sit there for awhile because I did not feel stable to stand up and go to the waiting area.  I stayed seated for about 1-2 more minutes then the paramedics took me to the Medical area in a wheelchair.    The paramedics checked my vitals.  My blood pressure was 135 over ?? I don't remember.  I told the medic my BP is normally 98/58.   She said my BP was elevated.   My pulse was in the high 80's.  My temperature was 98.6 and my oxygen was 100.  I started getting pain and pressure going up the back of my neck, into my head, eyes and ears.  It was very painful and throbbing pressure.  I felt dizzy and really high.   It felt like I was floating on the top of the ceiling and the people were off in a distance.  I was really woozy.    I then got diarrhea.   The nausea continued but I did not throw up.  At times my thinking was spacey, so I talked to the paramedic to help me stay grounded.  I narrated what was happening in my body.  They did a glucose finger prick test because of my spaceyness, but it was normal.   It was like my whole system was freaking out.  I was there and then not there, feeling like I was floating.    These symptoms continued for about 90 minutes and getting worse.  The paramedics offered me to go to the hospital, but I thought eventually I would be fine.  I did not want to go to the hospital and have a huge medical bill.   At around 90 minutes, I started having pain in my heart left side, under my left breast on my left shoulder.  The paramedics did an EKG and did not find anything but some irregular heartbeats.  The heart beats felt like BA BOOM, then my heart would do a cartwheel.  BA BOOM and another cartwheel.    At this time, my husband arrived and took me to the hospital emergency room because the pain in my heart was getting worse.  I stayed in the hospital emergency room until around 5:00pm on April 15th. They did another EKG and some lab work and did not find anything but low thyroid.  I continued to feel drunk, nauseated, pain pressure and throbbing in my head neck, ears and eyes, diarrhea, and like I was High and going to pass out.    The chest pain in my heart was off and on.  It felt like muscle cramping in my heart, under my left breast and the left shoulder.  I also got a pain in my left groin area, then behind my left knee.  It was a sharp and throbbing pain for about an hour in each location, but eventually went away.    While in the Emergency room, they tried to give me Ativan.  I asked what it was for and they said Anxiety.  I said I wasn't anxious; I was just having a reaction to my first Covid 19 vaccine.  I said I did not want it because my body was already struggling to handle the Covid 19 vaccine.  They said the doctor prescribed it.  I said I had not seen a doctor, and they said it is protocol.  The nurse then came in and wanted to give me a shot for nausea and I said no, I don't want any more chemicals in my body, it is really having a hard time already with the Covid vaccine.    I went home, was wiped out, still feeling drunk/woozy/high, also nauseated, diarrhea, very dizzy, had a hard time walking.  The pain, throbbing in my head, neck, ears and eyes was still there.  By this time, I could not find clear thoughts, and could not make sense of things.   I was very agitated and at the same time exhausted and only wanted to sleep.    DAY TWO April 16, 2021 I woke up with a smashing head ache, neck ache, back ache and general feeling like Crap.  The nausea and diarrhea were still there and had woken me in the middle of the night.   I felt like a truck had hit me.  I stayed in bed all day and tried to eat and drink as much as I could.  I drank a lot of water that day.  I felt horrible, but was able to stand without feeling like I was going to fall over.  Had trouble finding clear thoughts at times.  Still felt out of it and had chest pain off and on.  Also had the BA BOOM heart beats and cartwheels in my heart.    DAY THREE  April 17, 2021 Very similar to day two.  I felt weak, nauseated, diarrhea, pain all over, jittery, not able to have clear thoughts at times.   It felt like my body was still on RED ALERT!!!    I also had very shallow breathing on day  2, 3, 4 and 5.  It tired me and I panted just getting up to go to the restroom.  I am able to eat fine and keep food down.  BA BOOM hear beats and cartwheels in my heart have lessened.    DAY FOUR April 18, 2021 I felt a little better and made the mistake of thinking I was getting over the reactions and did too much.  Shortness of breath.   DAY FIVE April 19, 2021 I feel horrible again, Nausea is really strong as well as the diarrhea.  I am feverish, sweaty and shaky.  Shortness of Breath. Tight in my chest. I just took my temperature and it is normal, although I am hot, sweaty, feel feverish and shaky.  I am exhausted.  The headache is still here as well as the pains in my neck, ears and eyes.   The aches in my body are still here.  I have no energy.  A wave of emotions is also here and I am weepy and crying.    This is no fun.   I am able to eat food OK and drink lots of water to counteract the diarrhea.    DAY SIX April 20, 2021 Shortness of breath, very tight in my chest, having to take Benadryl and use my rescue inhaler to keep my breathing open.   Feverish, chills, shakey, hot.

I chose the Pfizer because the research showed it had the lowest degree of people having a reaction in their studies.    I was surprised I had such a bad reaction and continue to feel so bad.

Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed.

I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.

The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.

His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS.

Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 >2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable.

She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm.

Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead.

Of note, patient had received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 4/10/2021.  She had scheduled this primary care provider appointment due to waxing and waning blurred vision of her right eye, with associated right-sided headache that had been ongoing over the last week.  Patient reports that on the day of arrival she had not felt well, felt slightly weak and fatigued, but denied shortness of breath, chest pain or heart palpitations.  Per ER notes, patient was instructed on vagal maneuvers while she was in the ambulance, and had converted to sinus rhythm by the time of her arrival to the emergency room.  Per review of her telemetry on the day of discharge, patient did have one short episode of PAF on 4/15/2021, spontaneously converting to sinus rhythm, as well was intermittent PACs.  Her home lisinopril was changed to Coreg, without further episodes of RVR and with good blood pressure control.   In regards to her headache, patient underwent an MRI of the brain, which was negative for acute findings; she had no temporal tenderness, and ESR was within normal limits.  She did improve symptomatically with administration of Tylenol and Zofran for her corresponding nausea/vomiting.  On the day of discharge, patient was feeling much better, and stable for discharge.  An appointment with doctor of ophthalmology was offered to patient for 4/16/2021, however due to transportation issues, this was rescheduled for 4/20/2021.

For the rest of the day, the left side of my face felt very different from the right-side.  There was some pain around the temple.  The next day, and even through today, 5 days later, the problem has been mainly around my eye.  My eye often feels irritation when I blink and there is some muscular quivering of my lower eyelid. After speaking to my brother who is a radiologist he decided that it was unlikely to be an allergic reaction, and because the feeling of my face on the left side was reminiscent of the feeling I had a year ago when I had shingles around my left eye, he thought the reaction could very well be related to shingles.  In other words, there was a activation of a response that resembled my shingles episode.  This was bolstered by my speaking with my neighbor who also had the pfizer vaccine who said she had a very similar reaction affecting her face that lasted several days, and she,years before, had shingles on her face (as well as the shingles vaccine).",,,,,,,,,N,04/15/2021,04/15/2021,0,none,PUB,,none,none,none,,,2,04/20/2021,,,,none

On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite.

We want to reassure you that we do not believe anyone vaccinated at the  Clinic should be worried about their safety. Through our review, it has been determined that all patients who received a single COVID-19 vaccine at vaccination clinic should be offered revaccination.

If you received one dose of Moderna vaccine at a vaccination clinic, that dose is considered invalid and you should receive two additional doses of Moderna vaccine according to the time frames below: Additional dose of Moderna 28 days after your initial invalid Moderna dose was received at clinic, and Final dose of Moderna 28 days later (e.g., 28 days after your repeated valid dose) If you do not know which vaccine you received at a vaccination clinic, you should receive two additional doses of either Moderna or Pfizer vaccine according to the time frames below: Additional dose of Moderna or Pfizer 28 days after your initial invalid mRNA dose was received at clinic, and Final dose of Moderna or Pfizer 28 days later (e.g., 28 days after your repeated valid dose). We invite you to schedule your appointments for vaccination at another enrolled COVID-19 vaccine provider. There are many sites in County and elsewhere. People needing assistance finding a vaccine site near them or scheduling an appointment can call our 24-hour hotline that is available to answer questions in multiple languages.

She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were ""numb and tingly"" starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females <50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count <150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See ""Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"" and ""Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"", section on 'Terminology and HIT variants' and ""Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"", section on 'Role of IVIG'.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were ""all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination"" this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient's symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says ""Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are ""unlikely cases"".  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson & Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient's thrombosis is ""provoked"", with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 ""Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis"", Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel ""provoked"" thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..",,,,,,,,,U,04/05/2021,04/16/2021,11,see above,OTH,,,,,,,2,04/20/2021,,,Y,

I stopped scratching it since I didn't want to irritate it.  I then noticed the rash forming on my left thigh and eventually to my stomach.  It looked like hives so I thought it may be an allergic reactions but I didn't know for sure.  The back of both hands eventually started to feel warm and started to turn red and eventually showed what almost looked like welts.  I again didn't scratch any of the rash and eventually in the evening they disappeared and there was not a trace of the bumps or redness.   When I woke up on April 19th, I immediately checked to make sure the rash was gone and it was.  As the morning progressed I noticed a burning sensation on the back of both my hands, both my legs and feet, stomach and the left and right side of my waste.  I was concerned and immediately started checking online about the possible side effects of the vaccine.  Both of my feet were so red that my toes looked almost blue/purple and both my legs were covered in red spots which looked almost like the measles or the shingles.  I called my doctor to try and get an appointment but she didn't have anything available.  By the end of the day,  the rash was gone and again there was no trace that they were ever there except for the pictures that I took.   On the morning of April 20th, I again checked to see if there was any sign of the rash and thankfully there was none.  As the day progressed I noticed a burning sensation on both my elbows and forearm areas and there it was again.  The rash was also on both of my knees but not as bad the the previous day.  As the day progressed, the rash again disappeared without a trace.  By evening I noticed my hands were irritated and  I saw red bumps again but not as bad.  I also noticed the bumps returned to both my knees and around my feet.  This is very uncomfortable and I hope they finally go away for good but the fact that they keep coming back has me concerned since I am scheduled to receive my 2nd dose of Pfizer on April 27th and I'm not sure if I should get it since I don't want to aggravate my current rash.",,,,,,,,,U,04/06/2021,04/18/2021,12,,OTH,,None,None,None,,,2,04/20/2021,,,,penicillin and sulfa

Some of this, she has had but some of this she absolutely hasn't had until right around the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had struggled with some mental health issues most of her life. This last month she reported experiencing auditory hallucinations on Mar2021. She had auditory hallucinations before around the time she gave birth to her son, it was stress induced. In the past like what she got with her son, she would get a song stuck in her head, more like an OCD thing and it was stress induced. This time she would hear really critical things. Patient stated the auditory hallucinations she was experiencing in the last month were different. This last week on 2021, patient reported hearing her neighbors yelling and screaming and actually called the cops on them. She never in her life has she experienced this, these are more paranoia thing. The doctors don't think it was schizophrenia because that usually starts in the 20s. She does not have a family history of this. She has PTSD from her son's rare heart condition, like pretty severely and just had major medical appointment where they gave her bad news. The auditory hallucination could be stress related, but she was trying to turn over every rock. They're trying to monitor it over the next 6 months. Patient thought it was highly unlikely that it was related to the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine but could be stress induced. Patient stated that the auditory hallucination she was having currently doesn't fit the normal type that schizophrenia usually does, like it's normally specific people, other people have different experiences, it could also be sleep deprivation or stress induced, but she has been having sleep deprivation for the last 4 years, so it just starting now is odd.

Reported her doctors said there was no information reporting that the COVID-19 Vaccine was contraindicated in people with spinal cord leaks, and how the COVID-19 Vaccine would affect people with spinal cord leaks. She said she thought she may have been fighting things because the COVID-19 Vaccine was acting like the flu vaccine (when she first developed Oral Lichen Planus). She said she thought her symptoms after her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose  may have had something to do with her spinal cord leak because she had similar symptoms (lightheadedness & equilibrium issues) with her spinal cord leak.

Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn't control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn't too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon.

The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller's husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o'clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn't like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid.

1236420,04/21/2021,CO,4.0,40,,M,,"Around 4:00 pm on 4/12/2021 I began to feel a slight headache and my side effects worsened that evening. I lost my appetite due to the muscle pain, aches, fatigue, and chills that I felt. After taking a nap, I did not feel rested but instead restless. Because of the chills, I put on joggers and a sweatshirt, then proceeded to try and read a book while sitting under a blanket. I was unable to concentrate or focus on my book because of the chills, so I instead watched television. By 9:00 pm, I tried to go to sleep and took my last remaining dose of Tylenol. The aches and chills had only gotten worse and I was still dressed in joggers and sweatshirt as I tried to fall asleep underneath two blankets and quilt. All night long I tossed and turned because of the shivers, aches, and chills. I was unable to sleep for more than 45 to 60 minutes at a time before I woke up again. This happened repeatedly all night and it was very painful. On 4/13/2021 around 8:00 am, I got out of bed with continued shivers, aches, pain, fatigue, headache, and chills. I suffered from these symptoms all day long. Around 3:00 pm I tried to eat spaghetti with meatballs and steamed vegetables, but the spaghetti tasted like cardboard and I was only able to eat come of the vegetable mix. All day long I kept drinking water to stay hydrated and spent most of my time switching from my couch to my bed with restlessness, aches, shivers, and chills. The chills started to subside around 2:00 am on 4/14/2021 after I took a hot shower for about 15 to 20 minutes. Still dressed in joggers and a sweatshirt, this time I tried to sleep under two blankets, but the shivers and chills kept waking me up every 60 to 90 minutes. On 4/14/2021 around 10:00 am, I finally felt well enough to be able to drive to a store to by ibuprofen. When I got home, I took some and was finally able to take a nap and get some rest. I felt much better after my nap, was able to eat, and go for a small walk. This was my Pfizer second shot and it is worth mentioning that I live alone with no friends or family and I am an COVID-19. I had nobody to call and ask for help or to take care of me. I had to deal with the additional psychological trauma of not being able to ask anyone for help as I worried how long the adverse effects would last. I did not call my doctor because the last time I went in to see him, the facility charged me $170 for a 20-minute appointment and decided to take more than two months to let me know that I still owed $119. Everyone at the CDC and other agencies have failed those of us who live alone, especially public health officials, who did absolutely nothing to prepare to help and support people like me during this pandemic. Your ideals of individualism are bad public health policy for those of us who are alone, have nobody to turn do, and do all the right things by wearing masks, getting vaccinated, and staying six feet away from everybody. Yet, we are the ones who suffer the most and have to struggle with adverse effects of pandemic trauma, depression, and other mental health issues in addition to loss of taste and smell.
