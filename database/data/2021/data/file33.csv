Immediately upon receiving the second dose I felt faint.  I went to the observation area and when the feeling got stronger, reported it.  My blood pressure was taken and although I always have normal blood pressure, it was extremely high - 195/100.  My heart was racing.  I was observed for longer because of this, and was asked to lie down.  The faint feeling and high blood pressure lasted 30 min, at which time it started to improve and was sent home.  I persisted in having bouts of feeling faint (but never fainting) in the days and weeks following, joined with shortness of breath which started the second day after the second injection. I also had the normal fever, aches and pains for 4 days.  It is now a month after the second injection, and while the faintness and vertigo are mostly gone,  I have persistent shortness of breath.  Prior to the vaccine I had an albuterol inhaler that I would use 1-5 times a year for allergies.  Almost never used it.  I began having to use it multiple times daily after the second dose of the vaccine.  I am not on a steroid inhaler.  I have never had shortness of breath like this before.

Day 9, swelling continued & became hard, redness across upper arm above and below shot site, arm hot.  By evening decided to call doctor the next morning.  Day 10, Dr. office visit.  Dr. was not sure why this was happening, said it could have been something picked up on needle before shot given as there was internal infection and skin infection. He prescribed antibiotics and gave me an antibiotic shot.  Started meds as directed.  Day 11 skin redness became a raised welt and started crawling down my arm.  Arm swelling made skin tight and arm was still hot.  Day 12 welt almost to my elbow.  No pain only sensitive to touch and itching continued.  Day 13 doctor?s office visit again because of increased symptoms.  Doctor started looking at other causes, gave me an additional stronger oral antibiotic and another more potent antibiotic shot.

These lesions were many (about 6 on left arm alone), large, wet and open sores, painful, and would not heal.  At one point, I had 6 sores on my left arm, several on my right, a painful sore on my right buttocks, two painful sores behind my ear, a sore at the base of my neck in back, and a very painful sore on my scrotum, plus a huge blood blister on my lower lips.  As I was enduring all of this, I also had severe sores within my nose that bled profusely.  All of this was very painful and very unusual.  Nothing like this had ever happened before to me.  I treated the worst of these sores with Neosporin and bandages.  They have improved, but not healed entirely yet.   All of this was initiated by my stress and scratching behavior.

I went to an urgent care at 12 pm on 3/16/2021 where they gave me a 125 mg steroid shot and prescribed prednisone and .5% Triamcinolone.

I put the prescribed cream on and took Zyrtec and eventually went back to bed. I woke up at 6:30 am with extremely itchy sides. I went to check on my face and neck, but they were clear, now the rash was all over my shoulders, sides, back, and hips. I felt fine other than the rash, applied the cream and took the meds, and went to work. At work, I started to become itchier on my sides, lower back, and arms. I went to put more cream on and the rash on my stomach was worse as well as my arms were covered. At 1 pm my stomach, back, and sides were less itchy but the outside of my left leg was itchy and started to have the rash again.

After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it's working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn't hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now.

I still have a very slight pain at the shingles site rated at 1/10 on pain scale.   I suspect that the shingles reaction  was triggered by the Covid shot.  I am aware that if one searches the internet hard enough one will find the answer one seeks.  Sure enough I found a newspaper article written by a dermatologist in LA that wondered if there is a link between Covid vaccine and shingles.  He had treated 2 patients in a timeframe that suggested this link.  There is no research available on this.  I am a little concerned about getting the second Covid vaccine as it typically provokes a stronger immune system response than the first one.  I believe that I had Covid-19 in July with typical symptoms but I tested negative.  They say that the first Covid vaccine can cause a greater reaction if one has already had the Covid virus.

In the morning it got much worse. I had a little trip the next morning (3 hours each way) and when I returned home the pain was really severe. Used Ibuprofen at home and it solved the problem at first (for the weekend), it would take off that edge. But by Tuesday, I noticed that it was not getting any better just would ease off while taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Decided to go see my PCP. Initially PCP thought it was a case of tendinitis and was treated with Voltaren and Tramadol for night time in case it was too hard to sleep. Took Voltaren for a couple of days but did not see any real improvement so decided to go back to the Ibuprofen. The next Monday or Tuesday (about a week later) it was really really bad, and PCP gave me a shot of cortisone into that shoulder because at that time I was feelings numbness on my fingers and horrible pain in the shoulder. About 48/72hrs after the shot the pain subsided but the numbness and the tingling on my pointer finger and thumb were still present. The pain went away in about a week. Then PCP decided to refer me to see a neurologist. By the time I had my appt the numbness and tingling were much better and I had some tests done and they came back normal. Never lost strength in my arm. Neurologist said the numbness and tingling should go away on its own.  Now, 2 months later he numbness and tingling are really mild, I am a stomach sleeper and I can't because if I do it will make my arm tingling again.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the guillain barre syndrome, neuropathy, lymphedema, neurological symptom, slurred speech, weakness, tremor, mobility decreased, feeling hot, shooting pain, numbness, pruritus and fall to be related to FluLaval Quadrivalent 2016-2017 season.  Additional information was provided as follows: The age at vaccination was not reported. The patient lkely had GBS(guillain barre syndrome) reaction to Flulaval 2016-2017 which was acute and complicated. The patient experienced acute onset neurological and lymphedama 16 hrs post vaccination. It took 5 months for symtoms to resolve. 4th-5th January 2020, the patient experienced acute onset similar symptoms which were ongoing. The patient had a suspect exposure to Covid 19 in December 21, 2019. The symptoms began 13 days later including peripheral neuropathy all 4 limbs, severe lyphedema requiring bilateral carpal tunnel surgeries. The patient had persistent shooting pains, numbness, intense pruritus and other. In mid May 2020, the patient tested for Covid AG and AB, result was negative, unknown which manufacturer made tests. The patient stated that she suspected shouldn't get Flulaval Quad again. The patient wanted to know What was the position on She getting Covid vaccine considering severity of adverse run to Flulaval in 2016. The patient would see immunologist day after reporting 3pm MST. The patient stated that she did not want to be one of those patients who stupidly got another rabies vaccine then went on to develop an autoimmune disease. She at time of reporting hd an autoimmune disease from the flu vaccine. With regard to her experience following Flulaval, she stated she was sitting there and felt like she melted into chair. She couldn't talk. She was slurring.  The patient couldn't raise her head or arms. She fell out of bed. The neuropathy went on for a while. The symptom of slurring pretty well resolved within 48 hours. The weakness still persisted occasionally. She experienced tremors. This time around she did not have tremors but the neuropathy was ridiculous. The patient finally saw a neurologist. She first talked to them in Jan 2017 and finally saw him 2 to 3 weeks before reporting. She did not know. She said it was idiopathic. She had to retire as a result and has had no paycheck since 2019. Her take was that she visited a large aquarium 4 days before Christmas in 2019.  13 to14 days later she experienced virtually that same symptoms as she had 16 hours post flu vaccine, however that time it was much more, maybe another 25 to 30 percent neurologic, the slurring and slumping. The patient couldn't tap the phone with her right hand to call her internist. She had to use her left hand. And tremors persisted. She had to quit doing surgeries. Fast forward symptoms kind of resolved in terms of fine motor things and no tremors. She had to get injections in her thumbs 6x because of the lymphedema. The reporter was not sure if it was due to exposure to the virus (COVID) or vaccine.  The physicians she had been seeing have been contradicting each other. The reporter consented to follow up.",,,,,,,,,N,,01/13/2020,,"Test Date: 202005; Test Name: Covid AB; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:Negative,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Date: 202005; Test Name: Covid AG; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:Negative,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:)",UNK,,,,,,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2021AM,2,02/10/2021,,,,

The outcome of the event was resolving.; Reporter's Comments: The non-serious events of pain, headache, sweating, body ache, cold feet, tremors, slurred speech, elevated blood pressure, and sluttering are temporarily associated with the mRNA-1273 use and a causal association cannot be excluded.  The serious event of chronic small vessel ischemic disease is considered a pre-existing event based a diagnostic findings and thus assessed as unlikely associated with mRNA-1273 use.",,,,,,,,,N,01/21/2021,01/21/2021,0,Test Date: 20210121; Test Name: Blood pressure; Result Unstructured Data: High; Test Date: 20210127; Test Name: CT; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Date: 20210127; Test Name: MRI; Result Unstructured Data: abnormal,UNK,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: No adverse event (No reported medical history.),,"USMODERNATX, INC.MOD20210",2,02/22/2021,,,Y,

Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids.

This exam was performed according to   our departmental dose-optimization program, which includes automated exposure control,  adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction   technique.   FINDINGS:  Small lung nodules are seen in the visualized lung bases bilaterally. The largest measures 4 mm   on image 5 of series 2, previously 3 mm. Linear atelectasis is seen in the right lung base.  Degenerative changes are seen in the visualized spine. The patient is status post lower lumbar  fusion and left arthroplasty.   The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The noncontrast appearance of the liver, biliary  tree, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and the left kidney are unremarkable. There is a  malrotation of the right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is normal in  caliber. There is vascular calcification. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.   There is a midline anterior abdominal wall surgical scar. There is mild haziness in the  subcutaneous tissue and in the anterior omentum deep to the abdominal wall muscle. This could  be due to recent post operative status. Please correlate clinically to evaluate for wound  infection. No focal fluid collection is seen to suggest abscess.   The unopacified small and large bowels appear unremarkable. There is no bowel obstruction.  There is no abdominal or pelvic ascites. The patient is status post hysterectomy. The urinary  bladder and adnexa are unremarkable.   IMPRESSION:  1. Midline abdominal wall scar with mild haziness probably due to recent postoperative status.  No focal fluid collection to suggest abscess. Clinical correlation to evaluate for wound  infection.  2. No bowel obstruction. No acute intra-abdominal abnormality.  3. Small lung nodules. Mild measurement enlargement since the prior exam probably due to  difference in technique.

I wanted to be sure to send this along to you as well as, to the adverse effect website. It?s almost as if I?ve had a stroke. Initially (after the shot), I was a little lightheaded but as the rest of the day wore on, (say around 6 hours later), I started to get foggy in my brain - like I had to remember to even breathe - and tightness in my chest like asthma. There was a high pitch scream in my ears and I was more or less, kind of out of it. My hands and feet were sweating profusely. My tongue kind of reacted, too and got a little burned, like when I eat pineapple. It was then that I noticed difficulty swallowing. My sister (a medical professional) suggested Benadryl for the mouth and tongue sensation and she kept an eye on me the rest of the night. She also warned that I should not get a second shot (I totally agree). Being a trooper, I thought all of the weird stuff would blow over in a day or two, so I decided to power on and not report my issues.  Today is day 6 post vaccine and I can now see a pattern to the symptoms or episodes which are still present, on and off:  1. The ringing in my ears will intensify, and then I stare off into space, my words get garbled (I have to really concentrate on being present), my tongue gets very dry and then the swallowing issue returns (it?s like slow motion swallowing, so I bite my tongue to stay in the moment).  2. The tightness in my chest intensifies and my breathing gets shallow. I must focus and breath through it despite discomfort. Note, since the shot, I keep a Benydryl and my inhaler with me, although I haven?t used Benadryl since day 3. I used my inhaler yesterday, day 5 because of discomfort and that seemed to help, but using it triggered an ear ringing/screaming episode that came and went the rest of the day.  3. I also have nasal constriction throughout the day. The nasal passage just inflames and then relaxes. I also have phantom smells and my sense of taste got a little off on day 1, but recovered. ________________  March 18, 2021 Update  Saturday, 3/13 went to the ER because the cognitive issues had advanced. I found myself staring off into space, losing my train of thought, and unable to speak. When I did speak I stammered or stuttered. They wanted to make sure I did not have a stroke or that I was not in the middle of one, so they did some tests. They also recommended that I go ahead and take the prednisone.  After my ER visit the cognitive issues continued, but began to be not-so-frequent by Sunday afternoon. I felt like I was on the road to recovery and so delayed again, taking the prednisone.  On Tuesday (3/16), I had what I would call an asthma attack. I was having very strong bronchial spasms that would not abate. I used my rescue inhaler to try to mitigate the symptoms, but that did not work. At the same time, the cognitive issues sort of returned and the big loud ringing and whooshing  in my ears was really really noticeable.  I am having a protracted allergic reaction to the vaccine. I am not normally allergic to things, but I have noticed new allergies since this all began.

Went back to the ER on the 17th and had T-103 rectally. Rash was worse and spread to palm of right hand and hand reportedly turned blue. Testicles also appeared red and ""tight"", particularly the left testicle. In ER, eyes began to look ""blood shot"" and developed more diarrhea. Given TYLENOL had repeat CBC and blood cx.  Was admitted to hospital for observation at that time. US of testicles done, and flow was normal. At this point, eyes were ""completely red"", and rash appeared on hands. On the 18th, blood in stool re-appeared and fever continued (still in hospital). Labs reportedly all normal except for elevated AST/ALT and thrombocytosis - parents told that this looked like ""inflammation"".   Evening of the 18th received one dose of Ceftriaxone. Fever decreased but blood in stool continued. Discharged to home at this time. Afebrile x 36 hours, but then fever returned to 100.6 on the 20th and breaking through TYLENOL.

Feeds well, growing and developing normally as per parents. Dad healthy, no medications or medical conditions. Dad had COVID test 2 months ago and negative.    Lives at home with both parents, new home (2015).  3 dogs and 2 parakeets at home. Bird cages in different parts of the house. Dogs do not come into nursery, but patient is in contact with dogs. No tick bites noted or ticks on baby. Dogs all treated for ticks. Grandparents have not visited and no visitors in home since he has been born. Father (lawyer) and Mom (accountant) both telecommute for work at this time.    No other complaints.   Last dose of TYLENOL was given for fever, at 5 30 pm.   SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   Admitted to general pediatrics due to concern for atypical Kawasaki Disease. Peds consulted at admission. An echo was obtained and resulted negative for coronary artery aneurysm or ectasia. Also obtained a skull XR to evaluate the lesion on his head which was negative for osseous abnormality. On 1/23, he received IVIG with significant improvement in rash. He was pretreated with TYLENOL and BENADRYL and was also started on high dose aspirin. Blood cultures obtained prior to IVIG resulted no growth. He remained afebrile after receiving IVIG for 48 hours. On the day of discharge, he has been eating well with adequate UOP. He was transitioned to low dose aspirin (5 mg/kg/day), which he should continue for at least 6 weeks, or as determined by Pediatric Cardiology (f/u scheduled for 2/11).  Family was counseled that if Pt develops another fever in the next week, parents should call his PCP or return to ER as he may require additional treatment for atypical KD. Parents were also counseled that Pt should not receive MMR or varicella vaccines for 11 months following IVIG treatment.   Interval History: Mom states that Pt did well overnight. He breast feed almost every hour with no concerns. His energy level is back to normal and his UOP was adequate.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Home with family   FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS/ARRANGEMENTS:  Future Appointments  Date Time  2/11/2021 10:00 AM   Family to schedule follow up as needed with PCP  Patient should not receive MMR or varicella vaccine for 11 months after receiving IVIG.   From Cardiologist: ASSESSMENT/PLAN  Pt is an otherwise healthy 3-month-old male with a recent history of Kawasaki disease, successfully treated with one dose of IVIG. He did not have coronary artery involvement apparent on his acute phase echocardiogram and continues to have normal appearing coronary arteries. The CV sequelae of Kawasaki disease are coronary artery aneurysms, most commonly detected in the acute phase or within 4 weeks of the illness. He has been on low dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis within any coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia that may have developed. He is approximately 4 weeks post the onset of illness and there is no evidence of coronary artery disease today so I will plan to stop his aspirin. Given his young age, I will plan to follow him up again in 1 year to reevaluate for evidence of coronary artery disease. His mother will call if he experiences difficulty feeding, unexplained irritability, or prolonged sustained tachypnea.  Pt also has a patent foramen ovale, which is a part of persistent fetal circulation. This communication is likely to close on its own without significant hemodynamic issues, but we will reassess with echo when he returns for follow up. No interventions or further testing are required in the interim.   Our recommendations are as follows:   Cardiac Medications: may d/c aspirin Activity Restrictions: None SBE Prophylaxis: Not indicated Vaccinations: As recommended by PCP including seasonal flu vaccine. Synagis is not indicated for cardiovascular reasons.

I checked the CDC guidelines which seemed to not have been followed.  Instead of preparing the syringes right before the vaccination and administering them then, the vaccine was given with prepared syringes which were prefilled and some earlier time. I witnessed at least 10 prefilled syringes and one vial sitting mixed loosely in a household plastic basket next to a station. The syringes from that basket were used to vaccinate people one after another.    Furthermore, they were stored in said basket in direct sun on a warm window sill for the entire time I was able to observe this (~15 minutes). At one point the technician who used the syringes from the basket was told by another staffer to not prefill and let sit around that many syringes but did not act on it.   Given the CDC sheet says to immediately administer the vaccine after extracting it from the vial into the syringe  (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/downloads/prep-and-admin-summary.pdf) and here more than 10 syringes were filled and kept in a basket from which they were then used in a place where temperature may have been rising enough to exceed 77, I wasn't sure if that is acceptable in terms of timing and storing of the vaccines in sunlight on a warm window sill so I wanted to report what happened just in case this is acceptable or not and people receiving doses at this CVS are taken care of if needed.",,,,,,,,,,03/15/2021,03/15/2021,0,,PHM,,,,,,,2,03/18/2021,,,,

The next day, there was a small bruise at the injection site and a raised red area emanating from the injection site anteriorly approximately 1 inch over the anterior deltoid.  The raised area could be palpated just under the skin and on top of the muscle and took nearly 2 weeks to resolve.  This was very different than my first vaccine injection experience approx. 3 weeks prior, when I felt the needle enter the middle deltoid muscle,  resulting in a round raised red area about the size of a quarter that felt deep in the muscle the next day, and which resolved in a few days.

(Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage.

She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don't know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn't treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.

She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient's daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn't be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband's chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor's office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious.

This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn't been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don't know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband's nurse. When querying weight caller states he's lost 10 pounds, he's 142 pounds if he's lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn't feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn't work, didn't help the pain. He was also given a ""GI cocktail"", asked caller what was in the ""GI cocktail"", she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the ""GI cocktail"" but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don't look at the ""GI cocktail"" it's kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those ""codone"" medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband's and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband's sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn't said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn't think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn't a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There's more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he's there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn't get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that's why they haven't been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds.

She is calling it side effects but what she is describing, she has these episodes periodically but she has not had one in 2 years but it was bad one and it happened 2 days after her vaccine, she is not sure if it was side effect but she doesn't want to mess with it so she wants to tell someone. On 11Feb2021, the reaction started around 1:30 PM. She started feeling real jittery, she was hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms down to her elbows. She could feel her heart pounding and she had these before but no one seems to know what causes it. She worked with it she was busy doing other things then around 4PM that day it started getting worse. She could tell her blood pressure was getting involved. She started taking her blood pressure, from 4:30 on until 12:30AM she had crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89 and the highest pulse was 106 but it goes up to 188 and then it would be 158, 179, 155, 119, 166 and those are the top number of the blood pressure. Her pulse pretty much stayed high 80s 90s except for the time it was 106.

She also has PVC and sometimes they say when she feels her heart pounding and her blood pressure and pulse are fine, they said that is probably PVC. When her blood pressure and pulse goes way up she is miserable. She had it so that her pulse goes up into the 120s with this and she has had to go to ER before. She clarifies her pulse being in the 120s and having to go the ER was in the past, prior to the vaccine. She says no one can figure out what it is. Some said it was anxiety, she sat through a whole program on anxiety and they decided not that is not what it is. But the fact that she hadn't had one of these episodes in 2 years and she had a good sized one 2 days after the vaccine, she had a really hard one that is why she thought she better report it. It has definitely gotten better she still feels jittery and heat flush every once in a while, but her blood pressure is fine. It is 139/74 and pulse 74.

If there is immune competition and she did not respond to the vaccine because of her ongoing mono, then it makes sense to get another single dose of the Pfizer vaccine once the mono has cleared, as she will likely have memory B cells against the Pfizer antigen and may need multiple injections of the vaccine if the antigen presentation is different between the two.

The subject was in the open-label phase of the study when the event occurred. A 17-year-old female subject with a past medical history significant for multiple allergies with anaphylaxis received first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) on 20Nov2020 at 17:04 and second dose on 15Dec2020 at 15:16. Per protocol, the participant was unblinded and confirmed to have received placebo and subsequently received third dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 25Jan2021 at 16:50, all via intramuscular route in left deltoid as single doses for COVID-19 immunization. Ongoing medical history included penicillin allergy from 2010, peanut allergy from 2004, legume allergy from 2012, chickpea allergy from 2012, chocolate allergy from 2012, flaxseed allergy from 2016, all with anaphylaxis; pollen allergy from 2007, and asthma and eczema both from 2003. Additional medical history included: tree nuts allergy from 2004 (anaphylaxis). Ongoing concomitant medications included salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR) from 2010 for asthma, epinephrine (AUVI Q) from 2005 for penicillin allergy, peanut allergy, tree nuts allergy, legume allergy, chickpea allergy, flaxseed allergy and chocolate allergy, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) from 2007 for pollen allergy, loratadine (CLARITIN) from 2007 for pollen allergy, and triamcinolone acetonide from 2007 for eczema. There were no concomitant vaccines administered on same date of study vaccine and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of study drug).  The subject experienced hives left arm on 27Jan2021 at 10:30, shortness of breath 27Jan2021 at 11:00 and a diagnosis of anaphylactoid reaction on 27Jan2021 at 10:30, which were considered as life threatening (the event was considered life-threatening as subject with known anaphylaxis with tree nuts and subject reported similar symptoms). Clinical course was reported as follows: On 27Jan2021 at 10:30 (2 days after receiving BNT162B2 injection on her left arm) the subject started developing hives on her left arm and used her epinephrine pen at 10:54 and shortly after developed shortness of breath at 11:00. The subject did not touch or consume anything new prior to developing the hives on her left arm and the shortness of breath. The subject was not seen by a school nurse and self-administered her epi-pen. The hives resolved at 11:04 and the shortness of breath resolved at 11:24. The subject denied any other symptoms and did not seek further medical attention. There were no relevant tests done. The action taken in response to the events for study vaccine (BNT162B2) was permanently withdrawn (reported as not applicable as per investigator). The subject was not dosed vaccination 4 on 17Feb2021 (Visit 102). Outcome of the events was recovered on 27Jan2021.   The investigator reported that there was a reasonable possibility that the event anaphylactoid reaction was related to Dose 3 of the study vaccine (BNT162B2), but not related to dose 1 and dose 2 of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.  Follow-up (27Jan2021 and 03Feb2021):  Seriousness life-threatening justification, additional medical history (tree nuts allergy) and clinical course (did not touch or consume anything new before SAE).  Follow-up (18Feb2021): New information reported includes: action taken with the blinded study vaccine.  Follow-up (02Mar2021): New information reported includes: concomitant medication and action taken with the blinded study vaccine.  Follow-up (11Mar2021): New information reported includes:  SAE term updated to 'anaphylactoid reaction'.  This is a final report for initial notification of a life threatening event. .; Sender's Comments: The event 'anaphylactoid reaction' is unlisted in the protocol's Single Reference Safety Document (IB).  Pfizer's safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 28-FEB-2021 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Anaphylactoid reaction.Review of the database for the PT Anaphylactoid reaction had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases (0 of which were attributed to therapy) and 29 non clinical trial cases.  The information available in this report is very limited. The Company considers that there is a reasonable possibility that 'anaphylactoid reaction' is related to the study product. There is a plausible, although belated, time relationship between vaccination with BNT162b2 and onset of the event in a subject with a medical history of allergic diathesis; it is worth noting that symptoms resolved rapidly upon self-medication. From the available information for the rationale that led to attribution of a life-threatening seriousness criterion, it may not be justifiable based on past-history of anaphylaxis alone  The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,Y,,,,,,Y,01/25/2021,01/27/2021,2,,OTH,,PROAIR [SALBUTAMOL SULFATE]; AUVI Q; ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]; CLARITIN [LORATADINE]; TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE,"Allergy to legumes (Anaphylaxis); Asthma; Eczema; Food allergy (Flaxseed, Anaphylaxis); Food allergy (Chocolate, Anaphylaxis); Food allergy (Chickpea, Anaphylaxis); Peanut allergy (Anaphylaxis); Penicillin allergy (Anaphylaxis); Pollen allergy",Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Allergy to nuts (tree nuts allergy Anaphylaxis),,USPFIZER INC2021082081,2,03/16/2021,,,,

At 3:00 am (14 hours post vaccine), I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I went, urinated, and had a small amount of diarrhea. I laid back down and within 30 second had urge to go again. I repeated this six times back to back. I began to have severe lower abdominal cramping and could not sleep again. I didn't know if I had to urinate or defecate but the urge was extremely severe and constant. My temperature began to rise, and I was shaking/aching severely. I took 500 mg tylenol at 5:45 am and that kept my temperature around 99.5 (normal 97.5).  Around 7:30 am I called my OB and they told me to go to emergency/labor and delivery ward of the hospital. At this time, my diarrhea and urge to defecate to stop and it turned to a constant urge to urinate with near constant, severe, lower abdominal cramping. At the labor and delivery ward, they monitored the baby (stable and moving the whole time), did a fetal fibronectin (normal), did a CBC (normal except preexisting mild anemia), and a urinalysis (normal). Hospital determined I was not in labor and did not have UTI so they sent me home. I continued to have temperature raises (up to 100.4 but always took tylenol at this point), severe lethargy, no appetite, severe abdominal cramping, constant urge to urinate, severe shaking, etc. until approximately 8 or 9 pm that evening (32 hours post vaccine). Everything except the constant urge to urinate resolved. Three days post vaccine (evening of 2/15/2021), I began to urinate large blood clots. I scheduled an appointment with my OB for a repeat urinalysis and urine culture. I had the appointment on 2/16/2021 and the only abnormality was hematuria. Urine culture was negative. Doctor prescribed 7 days of antibiotics just in case (while waiting for urine culture).

At 6 and 9 months of age, she had two chest X-ray�confirmed pneumonias treated in the hospital with IV antibiotics and O2 supplementation.   On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.     At 12 months of age, the infant was enrolled in a study approved by the Hospital. Immunological evaluations revealed a combined immunodeficiency with normal absolute CD3+ T cell numbers, CD4+ Tcell lymphopenia (627 cells/�l) with a reduced proportion of naive T cells and T regulatory cells, increased frequency of memory CD4+,CD8+ cells, and CD45RA+CCR7- CD8+ Tcells (TEMRA). High-throughput sequencing of TCR V� (TRB) repertoire in sorted CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and T regulatory cells in the patient demonstrated a polyclonal repertoire with reduced diversity and prominent clonotypic expansions, associated with a higher proportion of unique clonotypes containing cysteines at the apex of the CDR3, consistent with a T cell repertoire enriched for self-reactive specificities likely due to defective thymic selection.  Reduced numbers of switched and unswitched memory B cells, hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 338 mg/dL), and impaired vaccination response to Haemophilus influenzae type B and Pneumococcus were also present.

A 51-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 21Feb2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 17Feb2021 15:40, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2012 to (diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus almost 9 years ago), neuropathy in her feet/nerves and reported that she only turns pink if she gets overheated. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Historical vaccines included influenza vaccine (reported as flu vaccine) which she gets every year and pneumococcal vaccine (reported as pneumonia vaccine) which she gets every 5 years. The patient reported that she received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 17Feb2021 and had an allergic reaction. She said she was at a podiatry appointment, and her podiatrist told her the pharmacy had an extra COVID-19 Vaccine available. She said the pharmacy staff came to her podiatrist's office to administer her COVID-19 Vaccine. She said about 5 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine injection, on 17Feb2021 15:45, her left arm started feeling flushed, her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck. She said 20 minutes later, she walked from her podiatrist's office to a nurse's station to be monitored further. She said while she was at the nurse's station, a doctor came by twice to evaluate. She clarified the upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red. She said her podiatrist asked her if that was a normal reaction for her. She said she told her podiatrist she only turns pink if she gets overheated. She said her left hand got numb and tingly. She said the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were ""twingey"". She said her podiatrist and his nurse felt both her arms, and said her left arm was much warmer than her right arm. While she was at the nurse's station being monitored, she felt short of breath. She said she wasn't sure if she was short of breath because of her nerves. She said her oxygen level was checked and it was at 99%. She said her pulse was 101, her blood pressure was 118/76, and her blood glucose finger stick test was 128. She said she was told by the staff monitoring her, she should expect her blood glucose number to skyrocket because there is a steroid in the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said the staff also mentioned she can expect blood glucose spikes as the COVID-19 Vaccine's steroid goes through her system. Her fingers in her left hand became itchy while she was at the nurse's station being monitored. It was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers. She said she asked for an ice pack to put on her left hand because she uses ice packs for neuropathy in her feet, and she felt an ice pack would help with the itch and burning feeling in her left hand fingers. The doctor came to look at her again and wanted to give her IV Benadryl. Then the doctor decided against the IV Benadryl because she would be too sleepy to drive home but the doctor did eventually give her an intramuscular injection of Benadryl 25mg (clarified as Diphenhydramine 25mg in a syringe) in her upper right arm. Within 5 minutes the itching in her left hand fingers calmed down, and the redness in her left arm calmed down to a pink color. She said 20 minutes later her left arm was still pink and warm. She said she was told by the doctor if her reaction moved out of the localized area of her left arm, to go to the Emergency Room, and to use an icepack, again, on her left hand. When she arrived home, her husband said she looked like she had hives and a rash going down her left arm. Her left arm was not itchy though. She clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist. She reported that while she was at her podiatrist's office her left arm was a solid pink. She then mentioned that when she goes out in the sun and gets overheated, she turns pink. She said from her left shoulder to left elbow was warm to the touch. She said by the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site is sore and her left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. She reported there were no blotchy, red marks on her left arm on 18Feb2021. She said her left arm is a pretty normal on 18Feb2021. The nurse who monitored her after the COVID-19 Vaccine shot said she needed to report her allergic reaction. She was told she needs to let the COVID-19 Vaccine staff know of her reaction before she gets her second COVID-19 Vaccine injection, so she can be monitored closely. She took no other treatment after she returned home from receiving her COVID-19 Vaccine. She reported she had a headache on 18Feb2021, clarifying her whole head hurts, and the headache has been persisting all day. She said she experienced tiredness, as well. She said the tiredness started on 17Feb2021 and can be partially attributed to the Diphenhydramine 25mg injection she was given. Her husband told her she looked completely wiped out, and pale when she got home after getting her COVID-19 Vaccine on 17Feb2021. She said she remembers being tired when she got home because her eyes were squinty. She reported feeling more tired on 18Feb2021 and her whole left arm and left hand are sore.

A 68-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 19Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She had about 3 surgeries in lumbar area for fusions due to scoliosis in the past years (history of failed lumbar fusions due to scoliosis). Last one was about 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included roflumilast (DALIRESP), duloxetine, loratadine, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and ""Spiri"". The patient previously received pethidine hydrochloride (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies; and previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264) in the right arm, on 28Jan2021 at 14:00, for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced a little lower back, bilateral hip and groin pain on 30Jan2021. The pain increased as time went on. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, after second injection, the pain (from first injection) became more intense and now has gone up to mid back and shoulders to the point where it hurts to walk, and she trips a lot. Nothing controls the pain including narcotics, heat, ice, Tylenol or ibuprofen. The pain was further described as constant burning, soreness, aching, stabbing and stiffening. The events were considered serious as the events resulted in disability or permanent damage. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.; Sender's Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory role of bnt162b2  to  the reported events  cannot  be totally  excluded.  The patient's history of scoliosis and failed lumbar fusions may also be contributory to the events.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is  received.
