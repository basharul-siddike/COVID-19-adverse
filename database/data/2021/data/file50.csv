Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I've ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I've had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I've continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it's improving.

At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am.

This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it's like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It's also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can't see anything.  There's no visible signs of something being wrong.

Vaccine was from Health Care. At first, after about 15 minutes I was feeling a little flush, there were light red splotches on my skin (only a couple, very light red - like when i get really nervous and get red splotches on my neck.) I felt a little nauseous and dizzy off an on for about an hour (but i had not had anything to eat or drink yet that day either). The site of the shot was a little sore and warm about an inch or two away from the needle injection site, but not a big deal. That night my right arm (which is where i received the shot) ached terribly, all the way from my shoulder to my fingers. The next day (Thursday, March 18) was the same. Sometimes my left arm tingled like it was starting to fall asleep. This went on the whole next day. Injection site still sore too, and warm.  The day after that (Friday, March 19) the injection site was sore (like a sore muscle) and that was it. Saturday, March 20, the same until about midnight. Around midnight my son, and I came upstairs from watching tv and my arm (at my wrist) was aching intensly! I looked down and there was a small lump where one if the veins are. I can see my veins easily here and I am very light-skinned. Son could also see the lump. My arm kept aching so badly! I was messaging the lump over and over. After about 5-10 minutes it went down a little bit, ached a little less, and i left it alone. The next day it looked like i had a bruise on my wrist and hand (where the meaty part of your hand is  going to the thumb.

I was sitting at my desk in my home office, took my medication and took my first sip of coffee. All of a sudden, my chest starting hurting. I cant say where the pain originated, it was in the chest/upper stomach area. It ached a lot, I felt very flush, I honestly cant remember if it were hard to breath, all i could think is ""what is this?"". I didn't know if i would throw up, burp, pass out. the aches starting migrating, still saying in the chest, but expanding to my lower back.

I did not feel the shot at all this time, but my arm was a bit achy soon after. One hour after the shot my leg muscles hurt and I felt fatigued. Two hours after the shot I felt really tired and really silly, kind of loopy. Three hours after the shot my L arm was hurting more and it hurt to take the band aid off. Then my stomach started feeling upset. I went to bed at 10:30pm and had a very rough sick night. I was awake most of the night, only dozing a few times. I had a fever (101) and chills; nausea and belching; dry mouth; aching and strange pains coming and going; a slight headache; and my L arm was hurting. By 7am I started crying, and I had more physical pain.  I got up at 8am feeling so sick with extreme fatigue, headache, and in a lot of pain in body. My Mom had to make my breakfast for me and I took small bites of that oatmeal throughout the day. I couldn't eat very much because my stomach was so upset. I felt hot and cold and got chills often during the day. By 6:45pm the fever returned (100.3) and I felt sicker again with head and tummy hurting; body aching; and nausea. Finally at 8pm I took 2 Tylenol which helped a lot, but then I worried what if that reduced the effectiveness of the vaccine. I went to bed at 9:15pm and fell asleep right away, but woke up many times soaking wet with sweat. The next day I still had trouble with temperature regulation and I felt very tired and headachy and my L arm still hurt. A few days later I got my menstrual cycle about one week early, and it was the strangest period I've ever had. It was a very light flow, I had lots of clots, and along with the small amount of blood, there was lots of clear stretchy mucous like I get at ovulation. After my first vaccine dose I got my period a few days later also, but that time I only had brown spotting for 4 days and no regular blood flow at all, so this time it was slightly more of a period, but it was really not my usual kind of period.

Then I started to get shooting pain all around my shoulder blades.  I brushed it off thinking that most people had complaints of feeling pain or sick the few days after their vaccines and then they said it went away.  Mine never went away.  After about 5 days it really started to worry me.  The pain was very intense- unbearable even- and i couldnt move my left arm or lie back in any way without incredible pain.  I called urgent care and they told me I could come in if the pain was bad but that maybe I wanted to see my regular physician to see what was going on.  I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer. They took blood and the only thing they noted to me was that I should have my doctor check my platelette count.  They told me they thought it must be muscular.  I went home.  Neither of those medications seemed to help.  The pain was less in the day when I was moving around, but towards the end of the day it was getting so bad (still is) that I can?t sleep or get comfortable.  My doctor did blood work and couldn?t seem to find the source of what was going on with me either.  She prescribed me a new anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), a new muscle relaxer (cyclobenzaprine) and a pain killer (hydrocodone acetamin).  Sometimes those medications help- they knock me out- but when I wake up I feel the same.  I can?t take them in the day because they make me too loopy and tired.  I don?t know what is wrong. I can?t seem to get answers and  nobody can figure it out.  It is definitely my left side. I feel it in ky head, my chest, my shoulder and down my left arm and it has been almost 5 weeks.  It seems to be getting worse not better.

It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn't hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn't going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting.

It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I'm usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.

I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn't using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.

After another exchange with my PCP she confirmed that it could also be a possible response to the Moderna vaccine #1. Today, April 14, I had an echocardiogram stress test that was equivocal and it was determined to be safe, I should have a CT scan to make sure there is no issues in the arteries.  The cardiologist also agreed this could be an ""inflammatory response"" to the vaccine even though I was highly anxious during the test.  I say this to be fair and not wearing blinders. I would like to point out that the morning I awoke with chest pain, I was not experiencing anxiety. That came after my worry about what could be causing  it.

1211322,04/14/2021,NY,35.0,35,,F,,"Sunday afternoon, March 22, I started having severe stomach pain, but I thought it was gas. The pain progressively got worse (located in my upper right abdominal quadrant, under ribs, radiating to right side of back and under right arm). By Wednesday, March 24, I went to urgent care. They thought it was a gallbladder issue and sent me immediately to the emergency room. I went to the emergency room at the same location I received a vaccine, . After a full work up, they ruled out I didn't have gallstones, kidney stones, a PE, or anything of the sort. They sent me home. The pain continued to get worse, I was vomiting from the pain. I have had smoothies and saltine crackers, and some soup, for the last month at this point. I'm not able to eat regular food without severe stomach distress. My bowel movements a few days after March 24, were constipated then diarrhea. Then constipated again, and diarrhea. I've been very hydrated - now that my gastroenterologist RX'd Zofran. Before that, i couldn't drink water without feeling nauseous.   I woke up Sunday, March 28, to the pain in my side, which happens often, but this time when I woke up, my heart was pounding out of my chest. I grabbed my finger monitor nearby, and my heart rate was at 211pbm (o2 was 94-99), for several minutes. It eventually went down into the low 100s. once i was able - i immediately had my roommate help me into a car to go to the hospital again and get checked out. At the hospital, EKG showed sinus tachycardia, and they noted my abdominal pain had gotten worse, but at that point, nothing else could be done. I'm now seeing Gastrointestinal specialists, and a cardiologist, but testing has yet to be resulted. I still have abdominal pain. I have also had a severe headache, the entire near Month since the first shot. Hydration & Tylenol help 50% of the time, other times it just doesn't go away.  It should be noted, that I did get my second vaccine shot, even though my stomach still hurt. The pain in my stomach has gotten manageable over the last three weeks, but part of this is just me getting used to it. I have also been prescribed a medication to help with the nausea & another medication to help with stomach cramping/gallstones by my gastroenterologist. these do not change my pain level at all.  Within three hours of getting the second vaccine shot, the stabbing pain came back in my stomach again. It was not a thought in my head that it was vaccine related until this second shot - or if it is vaccine related- but the fact that it came back with such strength right after the second shot leads me to make this report. My pain is now, six days after the second shot, following the same trajectory as after the first shot. my BM are normal. I would have gone to the emergency room for this pain by now, but seeing that it's following the same symptoms & timeline as last time, I haven't.  I have let my primary doctor know, which is the doctor listed on this form. I have not seen him since getting the vaccine. But we have been in email communication. I've also let my gastroenterologist know this information. For now, I don't have any any course of action, except waiting for testing to be resulted from the gastroenterologist. I am also on an extended holter monitor. The intense stabbing feeling coming back almost immediately, the same afternoon that I got the second shot, is what leads me to make this report. It seems as though the second shot restarted my symptoms back to worse again, but, they have NOT fully gone away in the 3 weeks after the first shot.  I did have a fever and fatigue the first 48 hrs after 2nd shot; fatigue & no fever after 1st shot.

I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma.

On Wednesday, it was definitely a scratch-like shape (2 lines, less than an inch long) and had begun to feel itchy.  That was when I had realized that it had the same pus-like dotted features of a cold sore.  But oddly, it's not right next to either side of my lips.  Instead, it is further down, towards the left side of my chin.  It is very rare for me to get cold sores.  I can't remember when my last one was, as it was years ago.

Especially since I had done nothing to injure my hand. In addition to this symptom, I also got my period on 4/13, the morning after I got the shot, even though it's not due for two more weeks and my periods are never irregular like that.

His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a ""sore throat"".  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to ""feel"" the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are ""dry"".  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.

In the morning the top of my head was painfully sensitive to touch (like it is when I have the flu), I was slightly groggy and while the chills had subsided the hip & back pain remained. I went to work thinking I might be passing a kidney stone as the symptoms were similar in location & intensity as when I passed a stone in 2003. The chills became so severe I was wearing my jacket in my office and that's when I made an appointment at a local Urgent Care facility to see if they could perform an ultrasound for stones.
