No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.

I had drunk some glucerna that morning for breakfast with my medication.  The RN had me wait for about an hour. I then called my primary care doctor who told me to go home and rest. He said that I did not need to go see him or go to a clinic or Emergency Room unless I felt worse. (I have progressively felt better).  I left his number and contact information  under the contact information above. However, I had received the shot from the Hospital site.  I am providing this as you were a little vague in your question about contact address. Anyway, my husband took my temperature about 6 pm. I had a temperature of about 93.8. I normally have a temperature of 98.6 F. He used a digital thermometer. However, I did not feel as if I had asthma. I did have a slight headache then and my arm was a little bit sore. Today (the 29th) my temperature is about normal. I do not have any breathing problems, but my arm is a little bit sore where I got the shot. I still have a slight headache, but it's not too bad. I don't need to take medication for it. There is no redness at the site of the injection. I should mention that one of the RN's did look at my fingernails and the color was normal which I assume means no problems with oxygen levels. I am only reporting this because of the extreme dizziness! I felt a lot better after about an hour after taking the shot, drinking the bottle of unflavored (still) water and eating the nuts. My A1C is back to normal today. (and remember I am not currently needing or taking any form of insulin but my doctor has my blood checked regularly and has for many years).

I slept poorly and felt as though my heart was racing overnight. When I awoke at 0700 on 1/21/2021, I felt very lightheaded with sitting upright at the side of my bed and """"blacked out""""/lost my vision, but was still conscious. I proceeded to lie back down on my bed. I began to feel nauseous and again attempted to sit up to go to the bathroom. I again blacked out. I lowered myself to my bedroom floor and laid there to rest for several minutes and then crawled to my bathroom. I began retching and had emesis of frothy sputum. I then felt the urgent need to have a BM and sat on my toilet, but was again lightheaded. I bent forwards to not pass out and completed the task and then laid down on my bathroom floor to recover. I was gradually able to crawl down the stairs and located my cell phone and contacted a friend. I pulled myself up to my couch and sat for some time. I checked my BP and it was WNLs, but low for me, as I generally take 2 antihypertensives in the AM. I did not take them at all on the 21st. I gradually was able to walk to the kitchen and drank several glasses of water and tea. In addition to these symptoms, I had severe pain up and down my spine, in my knees, shins and buttocks. I applied Thermacare heating pads to my occiput and sacrum. I had no appetite and was very lethargic, napping for nearly 6 hours, on and off. I took Tylenol later in the day when I was able to eat a banana and yogurt. By evening, I had a headaches and body aches, but no more dizziness. When I awoke 1/22/2021, I was not dizzy, but my head felt """"huge"""" and """"off"""". My body continued to ache severely and I was unable to come to work. Tylenol helped diminish the pain slightly. I was again very fatigued. I did not leave my house, feeling unsafe to drive. By 1400 I felt better and was able to eat dinner that evening. I finally felt safe to take a shower Thursday PM 1/23 I awoke at 0615 to work. I was able to work until 1700, feeling fatigue, but no other symptoms.

0987140,01/29/2021,,,43,,F,,"""I received the Covid vaccine at about 1140 on 1/23/21. I sat for 15 minutes and went to get up I was I little dizzy so I sat back down. I stayed downstairs for another 10 minutes. at 1220 - I then got up with no additional dizziness so I proceeded to go back to my department. It is worth noting that I normally have low blood pressure so I do sometimes get the dizzy light head sensation but it resides by sitting back down and waiting a little bit. For this reason, I did not think of it as a symptom/reaction to the vaccine.  Along the way, I got a little dizzy; different than my normally low blood pressure feeling - this was more of a spinning type of dizzy - hard to get my bearings. I kept on walking to my department as I work in Cancer Care and there was no one in the part I was walking in at that time. In the process I got an intense heat throughout my entire body - it was super hot it felt like a fireball. I then started to get a lump sensation in my throat. I got back to the department and my coworkers said I did not look good at all and had me lay down. I was later told that my face was very puffy and swollen. They stated that I was extremely red and overall not good. There was a definite sense of urgency. I then laid down and we put ice behind my head and the Radiologist came in to look at me. At that time I started to feel a tingling sensation in my throat and neck, I did notice a voice change (my voice was more raspy/airy and was crackling. I could feel my heart beating super fast and hard. At this time I felt like it was hard to catch my breath, I did not have wheezing or a tight chest sensation. The staff member then went to get a nurse from the neighboring department. We did vitals and my blood pressure was very high 168/98 was the very first one. Along with an elevated heart rate of 138. O2 saturation was 98%.  The decision was then made to call a rapid response. The response team came. They did additional vitals that stayed elevated in that range. They did a blood sugar which was around 79.  I was informed that I had a rash on my neck going down my chest and on my stomach. They tried to lay me down, that really bad I could not catch my breath and felt immediately worse, so we sat back up. Upon further evaluation, the decision was made to take me to the ER. I had developed a headache by this time. Upon examination, they noted that I also had a rash on my back. Benadryl and Tylenol were given around 1400. I remained in the ER until my vitals started trending down and the tingling sensation started to go down and my voice returned to normal. I was discharged around 1520. Upon arrival at home (1800) I started to get the tingling sensation and lump feeling back along with a tight chest and cough, along with an increasingly intensifying headache. I took 100mg Benadryl and 800mg of Ibuprofen(1800). This helped the symptoms settle back down. I have been taking 100mg of Benadryl every 4 hours because these symptoms keep coming back. Additionally, my entire body has started to be extremely itchy, onset was around 2000 1/23/21. I was unable to sleep well due to the symptoms returning, headache, and itching. Additionally, until 0200 I was unable to lay down comfortably without feeling like I was SOB. Around 0600 1/24/21 I started with joint aches. At this time I am still taking Benadryl every 4 hours 100mg and 800mg of Ibuprofen about every 8 hours. I have not had a fever.

Woke up shortly after midnight - 12:30 am January 2 and I went to look at the clock and everything was spinning - severe episode of Vertigo -took more Meclizine and I propped my head up and went back to sleep eventually and went to Dr the next day - Urgent Care. I continued to take Meclizine every 12 hours; Dr Prescribed Flonaze - Dr saw some clear fluid in both of my ears but nothing that should be causing vertigo. She wanted me to follow up with other my Dr on Monday. January 4th. She checked (my family history has brain tumors) but nothing seemed to indicate that I would not need MRI; but was diagnosed with Vertigo that day. She recommended for me to see a physical therapist to move the crystals to see if they could move them if that was causing it and had two appts that week.

I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn't sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn't want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days.

I went home and was still feeling the tingling sensation and had the rash which had spread onto my chest.  I took another Benadryl about one hour after the initial shot. This reduced the rash and tingling sensation. as it wore off about 4.5 hours later the rash, tingling lips and facial swelling started to appear. I took two more Benadryl and called the on call doctor at my physicians office.  He advised me to continue taking Benadryl until 48 hours after the vaccine, I did this every 4-5 hours including waking during the night to keep up on it. I was also taking Advil at this point to try to help with the swelling and a dull headache that had set in. I should note that I have never had any facial injections or anything like unto it. For 40 hours post vaccine I did this. After 48  hours the symptoms seemed to go away. I did start feeling a metallic taste in my mouth that night and the following night so I took a single Benadryl at bedtime those nights and that seemed to resolve it.

By 1:00pm I was dry heaving and began a temperature of 99.9 (when I usually run 97.7) with a very bad headache. At 2:00pm I started vomiting very violently, my body was on fire and I was very faint.  Diarrhea  started at this time as well. The headache continued as well as the nausea. I continued to vomit on the hour up until about 8pm. (I have black and blues all over my knees from being on the bathroom floor.) The headache persisted as well as extreme nausea. Soaked through the bedsheets three times over the night while trying to sleep. Too exhausted to take temperature, but I am certain that I had one. Wednesday, January 27, 2021- Could not work. Went to doctor to get a Covid-19 test, just in case. Doctor says what I describe could be side effects of vaccine. Rapid test returns negative.  Extreme exhaustion. Woke up with nausea and a headache and no fever. Extreme exhaustion persists. Could not get out of bed, could not eat. I was only able to drink sips of water.  Diarrhea continued throughout the day. Nausea returned strong at about 5pm and dry heaving began again. Headache returned as well as temperature of 99.9. Soaked through the sheets again this evening. Thursday, January 28, 2021- Worked remotely and I do not know how I got through the day. Diarrhea  continues as well as nausea, headache and exhaustion. Still not able to really eat. Drank Pedialite and was able to eat 2 dry crackers. At about 3pm, dry heaving and nausea. Headache returns. Unable to get out of bed.  Friday, January 28, 2021-  Diarrhea stops. Still experiencing nausea and headache comes and goes. Still exhausted. By 4pm, back in bed with 99.9, body feels hot and headache returns. Soak through sheets once again.  Saturday, January 29, 2021- woke up with just enough energy to report these side effects. Headache is quiet... temperature is normal. Very, very tired.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician's Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.

Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

These sensory symptoms feels somewhat like a Christmas tree with lights going on and off in different spots but always restricted to the left side of her face.  In addition she experience a mild headache but without associated scotoma, nausea, vomiting, or vertigo. Upon looking in the mirror she thought that perhaps there is some slight facial asymmetry on the left side.  In addition she reports feeling that her neck is weak on the left side and that she has to support her head in order to keep it from flopping further to the left.  The symptoms have been also associated with some pain in the left arm which has since improved as well as discomfort and achy sensation involving her left leg extending from the hip laterally down to the level of the knee. She was evaluated the next day by a neurologist. Her neurological examination demonstrates some subjective decrease in sensation involving the left V1 and V2 distribution but is otherwise normal.  Difficult to know to what extent the prior Botox injections could be contributing to her worsening left-sided neck weakness.  We are aware that the vaccine does induce a inflammatory cytokine response and it is conceivable that this is contributing to some of her symptoms.

It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected.

Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm.

This device appears to have a very large ""dead space"" as the safety shield is a separate piece which is leur-locked between the syringe and the needle. This large space is likely the cause of the lost vaccine liquid. 2. We had an incident today where the vaccinator injected Moderna COVID-vaccine into the above patient. Upon withdrawing the syringe from the patient's arm, the syringe and safety shield disconnected from the needle and the needle and needle hub remained in the patient's arm, requiring the vaccinator to use his hand to withdraw the needle.

On /around the 24th of the month which was around 10 days later I noticed that the site below the shot was red and hot. It didnt actually hurt,though every once in a while it burned a bit. It continued to take on a larger space and the spot increased to about 5 inches,and as of today, January 31st it has become lighter,but is still warm to the touch,but the color has gotten lighter,but still visible.There also seemed to be a darker spot,bluish in color in the middle of this larger circle.When it first occured i kept trying to find info on it saying that this rash could suddenly re-appear, but there was none, so i contacted my dr, office where i was advised to contact the location of where i received the vaccine. I spoke to the person in the disease office,and she told me she hadnt heard of anything like this and told me to call the Dr. I called my dr, who didnt quite know what to tell me,but this was a couple of days later,and by then i did find info on the internet,where some people said they took Benedryl. I took Benedryl then,and my Dr told me to take some Advil, though i dont know if it has helped or not. I am due for my second shot on Feb 11, and i assume i should ask for the shot in my right arm this time?

Monday, when I first woke for work at 5:35am I was still feverish and achy, although I could tell I was better than I had been at my worst Sunday evening.  After going back to sleep, I woke up at 10am feeling significantly better.  Aside from being rather flushed and sweaty, I felt fine the rest of the day.

The patient (baby) was breastfeeding at the time the mother had developed a rash, and was switched to formula on an unknown date in January 2021 (reported also as shortly thereafter) (exposure via breast milk, exposure to vaccinated person).  On approximately 12-JAN-2021, reported as between 12-JAN-2021 and 13-JAN-2021, the patient developed rash. On an unspecified date in January 2021, a newborn presented to the hospital with a rash concerning for chickenpox (chickenpox) (sought medical attention). The patient presented a fever on admission and underwent clinical testing. Meningitis panel using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed and was positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) (meningitis viral), also reported as VZV meningitis with cutaneous lesions. The physician wanted to send viral isolates. The time interval since exposure to vaccine was reported as immediate. The physician reported possible secondary transmission, rash vesicles of over 100 lesions; generalized rash- chickenpox, and meningitis with positive VZV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in CSF (secondary transmission). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leptomeningeal enhancement and confirmed varicella meningitis. On approximately 14-JAN-2021, the patient started antiviral treatment with intravenous (IV) acyclovir (reported also as an oral antivirals). On the same date, before the treatment, the specimen sample was collected from the patient's CSF.

Detailed shipping instructions were provided and reviewed including instructions about how to store a CSF sample frozen and additional case information was received. Additionally, the physician reported, that one lesion sample from the patient was obtained from 3 skin lesions and placed on transport media on day 4 of acyclovir treatment. After reading the program information, the physician wanted to know if this sample would be adequate to test since it was placed on transport media. The physician would try to obtain a fresh rash sample without transport media on the morning of 20-JAN-2021 to submit for testing.   The physician also stated, that the patient had some blisters remaining, but most had dried up ""at this point"". The physician would like to submit a 1 ml frozen sample for strain identification (CSF was obtained prior to the start of acyclovir and unspecified ""antibacterials"").  On 20-JAN-2021, at the day # 6 of acyclovir treatment, a call was made to the physician to help arrange for the shipping of samples. On that day, the specimen sample was collected from the patient's right foot vesicle/lesion. The physician confirmed, that there would be four total samples sent: 1 ml of CSF from infant stored frozen (collected prior to the start of ""antivirals""), 1 lesion swab from the patient collected on day 4 of acyclovir treatment and placed on transport media, 1 lesion swab from the patient collected on day 5 of acyclovir treatment stored in a dry container, and 1 lesion scab from the mother's abdomen.

It was offered at her worksite. The patient's medical history included ongoing Baker's cyst right knee. The patient had no family history. Concomitant medication included celecoxib (CELEBREX) from May2020 for Baker's cyst. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2. The patient previously took flu shot and she got sick (in the 1980's or 1990's). The patient had no prior vaccinations that were within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of BNT162B2. The patient, a Senior facility HCP, took a covid test on Monday and was negative. Yesterday (14Jan2021), she received the first dose and then tested positive later in the day. She wanted to know if she can get the next dose at the appropriate time or if she has to wait 90 days. On 14Jan2021, the patient experienced headaches in the back of head and ears, heaviness, it seems like pressure, fever, and exposed to someone with covid virus. It was reported that the patient was debating on getting the Pfizer BioNTech Covid vaccine and so she finally decided to get it yesterday (14Jan2021). Two hours after getting it and getting home, her head started to hurt and fever, which she thought that was typical. That night the fever broke and it started again this morning (15Jan2021). She works at a senior facility and had to ask for an extended medical leave. She was tested yesterday for Covid that morning and had the vaccine in the afternoon. She was exposed to someone with the virus. She knows there are 2 shots and now she has had the one. She wanted to know if it's safe to get the second one since someone said she may need to wait 90 days since being exposed. She still has the headaches in the back of head and ears, heaviness, it seems like pressure. The fever has been under 100, it's been about 99 and the highest it got was yesterday at 101.6 degrees. By the time she went to bed last night it got down to 98.2 degrees. She has alternated Advil and Tylenol. She took temperature at 6am today (15Jan2021) and it was 99.8 and so she took a couple of Advil to help and by 7am it was down to 99.2. So, it's staying in the 99.2-99.3 range. The patient did not receive any other vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient mentioned when getting the her very first flu shot, which she was hesitant about getting, she did get sick, but it wasn't immediately after. Since then she has been fine. She thinks this was in the 1980's or 1990's. She mentioned that this is a new vaccine and there is not a lot of information out there. She wanted to know if she will get immunity right away.

The spot was on his right leg and was pretty large and swollen, it was about the size of an egg or a little larger. He added that he does give insulin shots in both his left and his right leg.
