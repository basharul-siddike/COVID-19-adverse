This author reported similar events in four patients. This is first of four reports  Recently, a study showed that only 54% of organ transplant recipients developed a positive antibody response after 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and, among kidney transplant recipients, only 48% had an antibody response 4. At our center the seropositivity rate in organ transplant recipients was 37.2% 5.This suggests that a significant proportion of transplant recipients remain at risk for COVID-19 despite completing the vaccination series. Our center encourages COVID-19 vaccination for all transplant recipients. We estimate an active follow-up of approximately 1,680 fully vaccinated kidney transplant recipients. We had 8 kidney transplant recipients who developed COVID-19 more than 14 days after receipt of 2 doses of SARSCoV- 2 mRNA vaccine, administered at the recommended dosing interval. All patients were symptomatic, most commonly with fatigue and cough. The median age was 65 years old (range 36-73), 50% had received a previous transplant, the median time from the most recent transplant to the first dose of mRNA vaccine was 31 months (range 3 - 248), and 3 out of 8 patients had received thymoglobulin for induction in the 6 months preceding vaccination. All patients were on calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppression and 7 of the 8 were on mycophenolate mofetil. CNI level goals were not changed during illness, anti-metabolite doses were reduced or held based on symptoms and severity, at the discretion of the nephrologist. Symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 testing occurred at a median of 56 days (range 18-77) and 59 days (range 20-77) after the second dose of the vaccine, respectively. Three patients received casirivimab/imdevimab as outpatient and did not require hospital admission. Three patients were hospitalized and had a length of stay of 3 to 5 days, without requiring ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. All were discharged to home without oxygen. None of the patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody checked after vaccination or disease and viruses were not sequenced. Data on the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is emerging, however, vaccine effectiveness in the immunocompromised population is lacking. It is encouraging that our breakthrough cases of COVID-19 after vaccination were mild and associated with good outcomes. However, we should continue to encourage our patients to be vaccinated and also encourage vaccination of household members and close contacts. Recent guidance allowing fully vaccinated individuals to resume prepandemic activities probably should not apply to transplant recipients.

Briefly, the patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with very few medical problems who presented acutely with a worsening 3 to 4-day history of diarrhea nausea and vomiting.  He was brought in by his son who was concerned had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  According to him and the son he had symptoms for several weeks but only began to get worse that 3 to 4 days prior to presentation.  He is unable to eat or drink prior to this.  He had been prescribed hydroxychloroquine by her primary care provider as well as prednisone.  He was noted to be hypoxemic while in the emergency room.  He was started on dexamethasone and admitted to our inpatient unit.  He was vaccinated  Discharge Diagnoses      1.  Hypoxemia secondary to COVID-19  As above the patient was noted to be hypoxemic secondary to COVID-19.  He had a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary emboli which was negative.  However, it did show findings consistent with groundglass opacities as we typically see with COVID-19.  He did peak at a total of 6 L required on 2 days post admission.  Was able to wean down to 3 L with activity.  He will be discharged with home oxygen and likely will require this from 1 to 2 months.  He should follow-up with his primary care provider as needed to determine any ongoing need for this.  He should avoid any activity involving fire or flames.  He is experience welder and is actually very familiar with these precautions  2.  COVID-19 pneumonia  As above patient was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia.  He did also have GI symptoms with this.  I do suspect that he he was more acute than the family had thought.  Interestingly he had also had these skin lesions on his chest back thighs and legs that could be the cause of much of his prior discomfort.  However, I cannot quantify this.  He did respond to dexamethasone.  We started him on on remdesivir but stopped after noting bradycardia which is a known side effect of this medication.  3.  Dehydration likely secondary to diarrhea and vomiting secondary to COVID-19  Upon admission patient had mild AKI with creatinine of 1.3.  This responded well to fluid administration.  4.  Cutaneous skin lesions  The patient has extensive patches and plaques of his chest lower legs and around his waistband area he is says he has had these lesions for several years.  They tend to get better with steroid cream.  He has never had a biopsy of these.  Photos of these lesions were shared with her dermatology team who is on-call.

A problem based hospital course has been listed below;   o Acute on chronic hyponatremia, severe and symptomatic: Her sodium was 111 on admission (sodium of 127 on 8/27/2021).  This is most likely due to severe dehydration related to poor oral intake due to severe malaise, nausea and vomiting.  Urine studies along with low serum uric acid levels are suggestive of SIADH.  She received hypertonic saline due to symptomatic hyponatremia.  Due to overcorrection of sodium, she was also placed on D5 infusion at 100 mL/h as per nephrology recommendations.  Her sodium appropriately improved after that and was 130 at discharge which is close to her baseline.  She was advised to restrict total fluid intake to less than 1800 mL/day and her Wellbutrin was discontinued.  She was clinically and hemodynamically stable at the time of discharge.  She was advised to follow-up with her PCP within 5 days with repeat blood work.     o COVID-19 infection: The patient presented with severe malaise, weakness, cough, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  Chest x-ray revealed no evidence of discrete infiltrate and there was no persistent hypoxia.  She received dexamethasone 6 mg IV every 24 hour for 5 days during hospital stay.  She was discharged on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 5 more days to complete a course of 10 days of dexamethasone.     o Hypophosphatemia: Her phosphorus was down to 1.1 on 9/4/21 which improved to 2.5 after multiple repletion with IV K-Phos.   o Mixed hyperlipidemia: She is not on statin due to intolerance.   o Acquired hypothyroidism: She is on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.   o GERD: She is on Protonix 40 mg daily.   o Anxiety/depression: Her mood is relatively stable at this time.  Her Wellbutrin was discontinued due to hyponatremia/SIADH and if needed, she should be placed on alternative antidepression/antianxiety medication as outpatient.",,,,,Y,4,,,,02/15/2021,09/02/2021,199,"09/02/21 1530  Respiratory virus detection panel  Collected: 09/02/21 1415 | Final result | Specimen: Swab from Nasopharynx   Adenovirus Not Detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae Not Detected Chlamydophila pneumoniae Not Detected Parainfluenza Not Detected COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 Overall Result DetectedCritical  Enterovirus/Rhinovirus Not Detected Coronavirus Not Detected Respiratory Syncytial Virus Not Detected Influenza A Not Detected Bordetella pertussis Not Detected Influenza B Not Detected Bordetella parapertussis Not Detected Metapneumovirus Not Detected      Procedure Component Value Ref Range Date/Time X-ray chest 1 view - Portable Resulted: 09/02/21 1618 Order Status: Completed Updated: 09/02/21 1618 Narrative:   XR CHEST 1 VW PORT   IMPRESSION:   No significant findings.

I could not sleep. It was so bad. That would be form my thigh all the way to my ankle. If I got up and move around it lessen but would not go away. It was a huge discomfort. I went to my general practitioner, and he diagnosed it as restless leg and gave me a medication that I did not like because it did not take the pain away and would make me really high so he gave me another one. They did not do any tests they just assume it was restless leg. I went to my husband's doctor and he said it was restless leg as well. So, I went to a specialist and he prescribed me Neupro. I take that at night. It does not make the pain away it just makes it tolerable. That only lasted for about 6 weeks. Into the 4th week I noticed it was not working as well so I contacted my doctor and asked if he would increase it. That was on 08/30/2021. For whatever reason he was so slow getting back to me. He also prescribed gabapentin. I started taking the gabapentin because I could not get the Neupro. But it is not working. They are just trying to figure out what it is.

Advised that I would not anticipate any harm from receiving both especially as we are now 5-6 weeks past the administration, but since the vaccines are under EUA and this would be a rare circumstance, there is not data about such.

Stated she has been feeling good - went out of state and quarantined for 2 weeks after given the high rate of CoVID there.  She actually stated "" I feel even better having had 2 shots now with this variant.""  She told me she would be ready for her third shot whenever booster are advised.  She is requesting appointments for her oldest 2 children to receive the vaccine.  I will send that information to the vaccine scheduler.

This error was noticed the next day. Our Medical Director called them on 9/7/21 to make sure that they were aware of what happened and to let them know that per the CDC they should be fine and should not repeat the dose. She reported: When I asked how he was today he responded ""terrible.""  He explained that he's had significant back pain.  He stated that he was advised to have surgery but he's heard bad things about that & is hesitant to do that.  He has an appt tomorrow for a shot at a pain clinic.  A pack with pills they gave prior helped only a little bit.  He also intends to see a chiropracter.  I extended my concern for his pain & encouraged him to keep his appt tomorrow with the pain clinic.  I then advised him of the reason for my call He had previously received 2 pfizer vaccines.  When he came in for the booster, he was given Moderna. Patient became very upset & began yelling & using profanity. He advised that since he & his brother had the shot that they've not felt right with headaches & arm soreness. ""You messed us up."" Was repeated several times He expressed concerns that we could have killed them.  I apologized for the error and assured him that we were reviewing what happened in order to make a corrective action plan to prevent it from happening again. He advised it was already too late as it happened to him & his brother.  I advised that per CDC guidance, it is not ideal to receive Moderna after receiving Pfizer, but it is possible & does not have to be re-boostered with Pfizer. Harm would also not be expected. He advised that he will be in contact with other groups for their opinion including his lawyer.  I advised that headache & arm soreness is typical after the immunizations - both Pfizer & Moderna - & that after several shots, the reactions may be intensified since the immune system is already primed to fight the disease.  He reiterated the above phrase with profanity.  He then asked if I had another else to say because he had several phone calls to make.

About the 07/31/2021, all the COVID-19 symptoms subsided. My heartburn became manageable. On 08/11/2021- I had the Pfizer Dose 1-Within that hour of getting the vaccine. I had a strong taste in my mouth. I accepted that as maybe the heartburn coming back. I woke up the middle of the night, like I was choking.  About the 3rd day, I was heavy on Tums, Pepcid and Prilosec and I was drinking a lot of water and chewing a lot of gum. Chewing a lot of gum gave me comfort. The Acid reflux got so bad I was sleeping up on the bed, I loaded up on Pepcid and started taking Prilosec, after 14 days it didn't do anything for me. On 08/22/2021, I went to ER, because I was not getting any relief from the heartburn with everything I was taking. They checked me as if I was having something wrong with my heart. I had pressure in my chest. I am treating it like it was heartburn and my chest was tight. Treatment at the hospital: A GI cocktail and Mylanta and Pepcid, it's supposed to numbing effect so I wouldn't have the tightness in my chest. I felt a little relief because it numbed it. Once it wore out, I still had the tightness in my chest. The Pepcid, TUMS, and Prilosec caused my heart pressure to go high. I'm trying to stick to the TUMs and chew gum and drink plenty of water. This weekend will be a month that I have really, really bad heartburn. I am still having the heartburn 1st thing in the morning. I try to prop myself up at night and try not to sleep flat. At this point, when I started adding in the Mylanta and Pepcid, the heartburn has gotten better. I am 56 years old and I have never had heartburn before. I had mild heartburn after COVID-19 and it went away. It came 2 or 3 times worse with the Pfizer Dose 1  vaccine. I will be following up with my doctor and try to get a referral to a GI Doctor within the next week or so, because I am concerned about taking the Mylanta, TUMS and Pepcid and the whole mix for too long and it causes my blood pressure to rise.",,,,,,,,,N,08/11/2021,08/14/2021,3,EKG- looked good; 2 sets of blood work- to see if I had a heart attack- but results were normal  regular lab to check everything in general- the anemia came up.,PHM,,Losartan-hctz; vitamin D; women's multivitamin multi-mineral pill; diclofenac; PEPCID,Tested positive for COVID-19 - On 07/22/2021,High blood pressure (manageable); anemic -not taking anything for it,,vsafe,2,09/08/2021,,Y,Y,Shellfish- shrimp

I have a swollen lymphnod in my right armpit on mammogram and ultrasound.  I have the feeling of stinging that radiates from my armpit to my right breast that goes around my braline to my midback on the right side.  The pain in my shoulder has continued; it awakens me at night from sleeping now.  I cannot lay on either side as it causes pain in my shoulder that radiates down my arm.  I called my pcp within 2 weeks of the shot and was told this is just a reaction to the shot.  I also reported this again at my yearly physical and was told it would go away.  I has not gone away.  I reported this to my gynocologist who ordered a mammogram as I am having breast pain.  This showed a swollen lympnode in my armpit and an ultrasound was also ordered.  To this day I continue to have pain in my armpit, shoulder joint, arm, and breast.  It comes and goes, it last for hours or can be intermittent stabbing and stinging.  It has changed the quality of my life.  I now have an appointment 9/20/21 with an orthopedic doctor to look for help in relieving the shoulder pain.  I am constantly worried that this is going to cause cancer in my breast.  I wish I never got this vaccine.  I pray I can find relief of these symptoms.

As the pain progressed in my right shoulder/upper arm, I was losing range of motion and the pain was getting worse.  I was given Meloxicam 15mg to alleviate swelling, and referred to physical therapy.  My therapist noted that my range of motion limitations were not consistent with his experience with rotator cuff impingements, which is what I had been diagnosed with by Spine Clinic.

Cough, runny nose, headache, rundown, tons of mucus, fevers, aches. Was coughing so hard it felt like I was coughing up my lungs. They started to feel depleted and out of air just sitting normal at rest. I could breathe just fine and even inhale large deep breaths with no problem but they just felt depleted. Kind of like if you exhaled all of your breath and push push push every bit of air out of your lungs then hold it, that feeling right there is how my lungs would feel at rest and normal breathing. A feeling of a little bit of pressure on the lungs. But also like they had some fluid in them that I had to try to cough out (very productive cough), and they kind of tickled causing the cough as well. Wife (nurse) listened to my lungs and lower left lobe sounded coarse. Missed work Friday July 9th. Felt horrible all weekend and got a rapid covid test on Saturday, July 10th. It came back negative. Continued to feel horrible all weekend. Missed work on Monday the 12th, and called the Doctor for an appointment. Had a virtual appointment and he prescribed me a z-pack for possible bronchitis. Missed work Tuesday July 13th, but was starting to feel a good bit better. Returned to work Wednesday July 14th. Symptoms continued to subside and eventually all disappeared except for the lung feeling and cough.  To this day, nearly two months later, my lungs still have not recovered. I still have the depleted feeling, feeling of pressure on them, feeling of something in them, slight tickle, all of which makes me cough several dozen times a day. I can breath just fine and take large deep breaths but just normal at rest my lungs feel horrible and wrong and depleted.

After 2nd dose of vaccine patient keeps making small progress. Over weekend was able to feed herself, making small decisions on her own. Things she hadn't done in years. Caller thinking there was something in vaccine that was helping wife Alzheimer's. In Jan2020 she all of a sudden started having stomach pains. It escalated with her GI tract. Her stomach bloated up huge. It looked like someone had put a basketball in there. The GI doctors didn't know what it was. Their son happened to know an international GI endoscopic professor who saw her. She has had the entire colon removed except the last 30cm. The surgery was Sep2020. Hopefully this is a positive side effect. His wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer in Apr2018. At the last meeting with the neurologist, the neurologist was concerned about her decline. That was 5 to 6 weeks ago. Had first Pfizer COVID vaccination. Reporter was his wife's caregiver. He noticed a few things she was doing, and it got his curiosity up. There had been a gradual improvement in her cognitive skills. She seemed to be more apparent of her surroundings. She seemed to be comprehending tv shows and was laughing and understanding. She was talking in longer sentences. She has said 4-to-6-word sentences and once a 9-word sentence. Prior to the vaccine, if he asked her question she would grunt yes or no. Her sense of humor was increasing. She was beginning to putter around the house. She used to be a good housekeeper and he tries to keep that up, but she was starting to do more with her hands. She was tearing up napkins into square pieces. She was not back to coloring like she used to. What really made him want to call was because she fed herself three meals over the weekend. She had not done that in the past year and a half. Every now and then she would pick up her spoon or fork three or four times during a meal, but that was the extent before the vaccines. Patient weight was 106 to 107 pounds. Reporter spoke to his wife's family doctor about this. Her neurologist is (Name). The last time he saw reporter's wife he was concerned about the decline. She would just sit in the chair. That was five or six weeks ago. Reporter did send email to see if any there were any other reports, but he has not heard back. The first dose was three weeks before on 18Jan2021 in upper left arm and three days later was when he started noticing things. He would say about the twentieth or twenty first was when he started noticing things. It had been gradual. Little changes over different days. Nothing extreme. The other thing she did that was astounding to him was she walked up to him and said, ""Are you ok?"" Then she said, ""Just checking on you."" That astounded him. She had been cool calm and collective her whole life. In Apr2018 she started panicking. It was bizarre. She thought someone had murdered their neighbour and was after them. Their lives changed in a snap in Apr2018. She had a hard time last year. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in Apr2018. No further details provided.

Medical history included, thyroid, racing heart (medication for thyroid, and fast heart rate (Toprol), arthritis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included metoprolol succinate (TOPROL) taken for palpitations, start and stop date were not reported.

The patient received 1st dose of covid vaccine 3 weeks ago. Had 2nd of vaccine dose yesterday. With 1st dose arm was a little sore and with 2nd dose facility told caller she might had more soreness. Came home got email from friend saying not take Tylenol or Advil. No one told her this information prior to getting vaccine. Said she takes 2 Motrin every morning for Arthritis and now was freaking out that vaccine won't be good. She was trying to stay calm. It was nothing bad about Pfizer. She was proud to say she will be 64 on her birthday. Her birthday was on Friday. She got so nervous. She was calling because she was so excited that she was done. This time she got it at 12:00 in the afternoon and at 9:00 PM, On 15Feb2021 she felt pain at the injection site. It was painful when she touches her arm. She has a little dull headache. She is scared that it didn't work. After second dose caller said around 9 pm she experienced: injection discomfort/pain- definitely more severe than 1st dose, but tolerable. If I go above my boobs, over my head, or touch it, I feel it. No different than a tetanus shot. Caller also experienced slightest dull Headache, over my forehead and over my eyes. Feels a little fuzzy, feels a little off, slightly chillier than i usually feel, a bit cold. Caller said, injection site pain was like tetanus shot, tetanus shots feel worse than a flu shot. Caller said the vaccination provider told her that side effects could be a little worse after the 2nd dose and was told by the nurse to take Tylenol or Motrin if you had side effects. Caller said, she petrified that my vaccine did not work, because she took her daily Motrin before the vaccine. Caller asked, the fact that my arm was hurting, that was a good sign. I know people got side effects, and that mean your body was working with the vaccine. Caller was also discussing husbands experience with both dose of vaccine. Husband, was 65 year old male. The following experience information given by caller/wife. after the 1st dose, he had arm pain very quickly/right away. I think the administrator you know how you got the injection and then you get pain to the elbow. I think they hit a nerve. Caller said her husband came out from getting the 1st dose and said, my arm, it was killing me right after his dose. After 2nd dose normal injection site pain. Only when you go midway up and back and touching of injection site. Arm pain on the same level. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Description of complaint: On 25Jan2021 she had first dose. The nurse said she may feel nothing, but if she needed it caller could take Tylenol or Motrin. With the first shot she did not feel anything. She got it at 12:00 PM. At 2AM she felt a twinge at the injection site and she was so happy. Yesterday when she got it the nurse said you may not feel anything or you may need Motrin or Tylenol. The nurse said that caller may feel more than after the first one like a headache or muscle aches. A friend said not to take any analgesic because it completely eradicates the vaccine. She takes two of the 200 mg over the counter Motrin every morning. Before she got the vaccines they asked if she had any other vaccines and if she had COVID testing. No one ever asked if she took two Motrin. When she got this text she flipped out. Does that mean the vaccines did not work. She was scared that it did not work. They scared her and they made her feel that because she took the Motrin before the shot it won't work. Her husband started researching it and it said to continue mediations prescribed though it could effect the glands. She was scared that it didn't work. She does not understand why she did not read anything that said not to take Motrin. That was so confusing. She could had just not taken it. She was very upset. Caller clarified her question. Does Motrin effect the efficacy of the COVID vaccine. Caller declined to proceed with report. Caller asked, How long does it take for 2nd dose to protect me. it was 2 weeks or we do not know how long we are protected. Caller said, so if I went for antibody test in 2 weeks. should it come back, I believe everyone should do it (antibody testing). Caller asked, if there was not way of knowing if she truly protected or if Motrin did any harm. Do you think they would ask me to get the vaccine again and tell me not the take the Motrin before doses.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient stated that when they administered it (first dose), they just gave it to her in her arm. However, she states that when she went for her second dose, she noticed that the vaccination provider ""pulled up the skin"" on her arm and then injected the vaccine. She states she could feel it ""go through my arm"" that time. She says yesterday she read online that the skin should not be lifted prior to injecting the vaccine and would like to know if this makes her second dose less effective. The patient stated that Nurse lifted fatty part of her arm and gave the vaccine it was not the way supposed to give the vaccine and should be directly into the deltoid muscle. The patient reported she does not know if that was the deltoid muscle that she used or not or if that was correct, but they said it needs to be done the other way, the patient reported.

As primary workers, all staff was encouraged to get vaccinated - and to see the death and dying - we did.   Had my first dose in December, 2020, second dose in January, 2021. A few months later, my vision was changing ( known floaters as previously mentioned).  My eye doctor, performed further tests and diagnosed me as having Fuchs corneal dystrophy.  This ia an autosomal dominant trait, but why did it show its colors aggressively.  There is no alleviating treatments, but will probably have endothelial keraptoplasty in the future. HOWEVER, never hearing of this disease after 40 years in the health field, I looked more into this disease.  The last sentence in one optic journal stated  ""...paraphasing...  due to increase knowledge with human genome, 96 newly discovered microRNAs are now discovered and associated with malignancies.  Fuch's corneal dystrophies are associated with breast cancer!    This really peaked my interest. Immediately got script for mammogram in May - abnormal,  June-confirmed abnormality,  July - ultrasound  -site found , August -biospsy confirmed breast cancer,  September - MRI confirmed site.  Now for surgery, Radiation treatments, and hormone therapy.  But I am not alone, I have a friend, newly diagnosed with breast cancer, co-workers newly diagnosed with gall bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancers, a friend with thymus cancer, etc.      I think you will see more and more cancers evidenced.

My legs had an incredible ?heaviness? to them, almost like It got so bad that in mid june I contacted my primary doctor and he referred me to the knee surgeon.

He thought it might be vascular or nerve or spine related.  I was out of state and flew home to have blood tests done and basically they all retuned normal.  Eventually from insistence by myself, my doctor had mri?s and x-rays done which revealed my spine was not causing the issues with the legs.  During a CT scan for my kidneys, the tech found a pulmonary embolism of my right lower lobe and extending into several segmental arteries.

My wrist was starting to feel achy. on 8/11, the flu like symptoms had gone away but had extreme wrist pain, so much so that I couldn't bear weight on it.  on 8/15, I was in a yoga class and couldn't bear any weight on it. I wore a brace for the next few days. The week of 8/19 I started to notice the pain had moved from my wrist up into my forearm. I started experiecing bad headaches that would start at base of my head on the left side. I started to experiencing neck and shoulder pain on the left side of my body. Later into the week, my left side lymph nodes were swollen, i had pain in my ear. I noticed that lying down my left side of my face felt looser, specifically at my mouth, where it felt almost like I was slighty drooling. I have never ever experience any things such as these, and it was all left side dominant. On 8/26, i couldn't stand the wrist pain anymore, so I visited my chiropractor to see if by change i had a broken wrist or something else causing all these problems. I told them about the shot and they said some people feel pain, but not normally 3 weeks later though some RA or autoimmune patients have experience longer term joint pain. I have never been diagnosed with either of those, and again it was only happening on the left side.  THe pain continues into the weekend and following week. on 8/30, I woke up with pain in my shoulder and rotator cuff, to the point where it hurt to lift my arm.  I went to my massage therapist to see if she could work out the body pain. I had my last massage with her in July. At this appointment, she told me my left side felt completely different: my muscles felt ropey, hard, and only on the left side. This was present in my left arm, neck, left pectoral muscles, face, and top of skull. The left side of my skull felt as if it were swollen.  on 8/31, I woke up with a swollen elbow and a not the size of walnut in my inner left elbow . On 9/2, I went to see my gynecologist for a medical procedure (iud replacement) and the nurse couldn't take my blood pressure on the left side due to the pain. She asked if I had a bad blood draw or had injured my arm when she saw the swelling. I told her what happened and she told me I should file a report here because that actually happened to her and she was allergic to the shot. Though i had not told many, no one had my symptoms until I met her. I was supposed to take the second shot but declined due to the fact I was still dealing with issues surrounding the first one and I don't want to do anything that steals any more of my mobility. I still have the swollen elbow, shoulder pain, and lymph nodes  as of 9/9, I finally am seeing improvement in my wrist, being able to bear weight on it once again, but still not back to its normal pre-shot mobility. I started to notice 9/6 - 9/9 that I have had some weird sensations in legs...left knee locking up, sharp pain down the arch of my foot across the pad of my foot, randomnly and sharp pains. Again....all left dominant. I don't know what is wrong: if I am having an allergic reaction or if my shot was messed up. I will not take the shot again or in my second arm, to risk my safety and wellbeing, until/if I have answers as to what is happening to me and what I shoudl expect.",,,,,,,,,N,08/06/2021,08/09/2021,3,none,PHM,,none,none,none,,,2,09/09/2021,,Y,,diflucan

He apparently became diaphoretic and had multiple episodes of vomiting. He profoundly became sick so he was brought to our ER where he initially presented hypoxic and tachypneic. Workups done showed WBC of 17.4, creatinine of 1.36, mild transaminitis and lipase of 40,900. He had undergone CT abdomen which showed findings suggestive of mild pancreatitis centered in the pancreatic head region and an ultrasound which revealed 1.7 cm nonshadowing sessile echogenic nodular focus near the gallbladder which may represent gallbladder polyp versus biliary sludge. He was given 2 L IVF, several doses of fentanyl, Dilaudid and Zofran. Patient was still writhing in pain when I evaluated him. He denies prior history of similar problem and claims he was in his baseline health before the onset of his presenting symptoms. He apparently had a bottle of beer after his routine walk at around 11:00 a.m. to celebrate Memorial day. He is not aware of any hepatic biliary issue and does not drink alcohol regularly (maximum around 6 packs per month). He does have GERD for which he is on PPI. He does not smoke. He is retired from military and currently works for the government. HOSPITAL COURSE- patient presented with intractable abdominal pain and vomiting, found to have acute, mild pancreatitis. Due to lack of improvement a follow up CT of the abdomen was done on 6/4 which showed worsening pancreatic necrosis, developing pseudocyst and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. On 6/5 he had to be transferred to the ICU for worsening condition. He was eventually intubated and started on dexmedetomidine and furosemide. He remained intubated until 6/8 when he was extubated after he passed spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trial. However his white blood cell continued to climb and remained febrile. At this point vancomycin was started. He was also started on tube feedings. However on the 6/11 he started having significant output from his nasogastric tube. There is question about his ability to absorb medication. After a few days he started showing improvement and general surgery started him on a clear liquid. He continued to improved and he was eventually moved out of ICU to the medical floor on floor on 6/13. However the following day, 6/14, he again had Increased abdominal pain while just on clear liquid diet. A repeat CT abdomen was done which showed increased peripancreatic fluid collection. GI was consulted on 6/15 to evaluate for NJ feeding tube placement. However this was not done until 6/17 due to patient spiking a fever of 101.2 F on 6/16. On his EGD it showed superficial ulceration within the pre-pyloric antrum s/p nasoenteric feeding tube placement. He was again placed on tube feedings. On 6/18 his tube feedings were near goal. However his abdominal pain started to increase again and his abdomen was also noted to be consistently distended. He was also requiring significant amount of IV pain medication. This was discussed with ACS who recommended to get a repeat CT abdomen pelvis. GI also recommended changing his antibiotic to meropenem. Unfortunately he had a reaction to meropenem and after discussion with ID his antibiotic was again changed to Zosyn. His repeat CT in the meantime showed further increase in size and number of pseudocysts. ACS service advised for conservative management and GI discussion. No plan for urgent surgery. IR Service was also consulted to evaluate for cyst drainage but after discussion with ACS they did not go through with the aspiration to avoid fistula formation. At this point the patient was taken of tube feeding and was placed on TPN. The patient finally started having consistent improvement. His WBC trending down and became normal. His NGT was eventually discontinued as well as his antibiotic per GI and ACS recommendation on 6/23. He had a repeat CT abdomen and pelvis on 7/6 which showed no definite pancreatic necrosis and pseudocysts remain unchanged. His nausea managed eventually with scheduled reglan and PRN zofran and for his pain, PRN dilaudid and scheduled ER oxycodone. He is tolerating his TPN and oral meds with sips of water at this point but still couldn't tolerating any food orally. The patient will need to have another CT abdomen and pelvis done with contrast to evaluate the pseudocyst in 4-5 weeks (end of July). He can then be referred to outpatient GI through the VA to determine if he needs aspiration of his pancreatic pseudocyst. This was the recommendation by ACS and GI here in the hospital. FINAL DIAGNOSIS- Acute pancreatitis necrotizing/ Pancreatic pseudocyst secondary to above/  Severe sepsis/ Orthostatic hypotension/ A.

About 20 minutes later, the pain passed and went away.   I went to ENT doctor  today- polyps didn't change.

And then it slowly got better and I felt absolutely fine. After getting vaccinated, I started going outside a bit more, and walking more, and that is when I realized that my stamina had completely decreased. Then, in late May, I was at the mall walking and my heart skyrocketed. I had severe heart palpitations, chest pain, and extremely weird tachycardic beats. I was diagnosed with sinus arrhythmia and benign not common heart palpitations that lasted very little. This was completely different. If I had to estimate it would be close to The 200s. I called EMS And they had to walk me out to where my ride walked me back to the car. Ever since that day my body has completely changed. I am constantly exhausted, exhausted actually is an understatement. The immediate day after my heart was still seemingly tachycardic, I had chest pains, my heartfelt week, it felt like my ribs and my chest cavity were breaking, I could not walk or get up from bed or even shift positions while I was sleeping without my heart rate skyrocketing and the blood rushing from my head and feeling lightheaded and dizzy. Psychologically I was also not my best. My body not working the way it needs to give me extreme anxiety, and I could not be alone for the longest time. It started to get better but four months later I still have lingering symptoms. I had Covid back in Christmas of 2020 but it felt like allergies and we did not have a severe effect on me it seemed. The vaccination and how it reeked havoc on my body has seemed worse than the actual disease. Symptoms I have now is consistent breathlessness which worsens on some days and is better on others, but it is always there. I can?t run or walk fast without my body seeming like it has to catch up with me. I get chest pains I still get heart palpitations and sometimes my heart races for no reason at all and my resting heart rate is about 110 generally. And the worst one of all is I feel this constant pressure under my rib cage and above my belly button that never goes away and it was not there before. I have gone to two cardiologists Since then, my primary care doctor multiple times, made multiple ER visits, I?ve gone to a pulmonologist, and I?ve gone to a gastroenterologist and did an endoscopy. Every single doctor I go to says there?s nothing wrong with my body. I am in the mist of getting a second opinion for a pulmonologist and a check up on my gallbladder but every test consistently comes back negative. I I have always been around tons of people, been around crowds, and have loved exploring in the past. Now I have developed severe social anxiety where I can?t even drive through cities without someone with me or walk down the street. I have become hyper sensitive to loud noises, vibrant displays, and I prefer the silence. And for weeks I could not leave my house and I was afraid I was agoraphobic. All in all I feel like a completely different person than I was before getting the vaccine. No one knows what is going on with me and I can?t often articulate or verbalize the experience that I?m dealing with. The worst part of it all is the breathlessness part and the feeling of my body deconditioning from the vaccine.

I didn't know the rash had moved down my back to the top of my butt, down my legs, my shoulders up into my hair and in my groin (on the skin) I went to the doctor who sent me for blood work. The blood work showed I had ANA. I was then sent to a rheumatologist. They said they did not find anything conclusive. They said I had nothing to worry about, it was not any underlying condition. My PCP sent me to a dermatologist that gave me something topical. It had aluminum in it, and I do not use aluminum, so I did not use it. I was sent to another dermatologist who did a biopsy of the rash. They couldn't figure out what it was. My PCP sent me for more blood work which came back with nothing again. I was tested for Lyme disease which was negative. I was told to take prednisone, but I did not take it because I was determined to be highly sensitive to pharmaceuticals and drugs. I also tried Benadryl at one point which gave slight relief. I was given a cream which I used, and it helped for 15-20 mins. I used some natural remedies such as plantain and yaro paste as well as calendula flower which heled the most. I have also stopped eating red meat. I went to an allergist where I was tested, and nothing was different. I also stopped my blood pressure medication. When I did, my heart started doing something different. I wore a heart monitor, and I was told I might have a heart murmur but nothing to worry about. I also had a stress test done which I did well on. I haven't taken any medication or the past months now. I do still have some hives but not as much as initially.

Close to the 15 minutes I started feeling like  a pulling string feeling from my upper shoulder going up towards my neck. I let them know about it and they said to move it around. I was already moving it and massaging my arm. They told me to apply ice on it. They checked on me later and I stayed there for a little over an hour. Then I don't know if its because I was nervous or what but I felt hyper. The whole time before getting the vaccine I was talking a lot and after getting the vaccine I continued to talk a lot instead of feeling down. I continued to ice it. It felt like I was on caffeine. Finally I felt fine. I did not really have any pain or discomfort for the rest of the day. At 3 am in the morning I noticed the pain but I thought it was a dream. I was moaning and turning until I realized it was not a dream. I was having really severe aches and pain deep in my armpit. I did not take any medication so I went back to sleep. The first day I took Tylenol.  After the 3 am episode I was good for pretty much until early afternoon. When I got home I was eating my food and it felt like I was starting to get the pain again. I just iced it again and I was fine. Then, when the vsafe check in came in at around 2:30 that's when things changed. I went to the bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I noticed a little bulge in between my chest and arm. As I raised my arm I noticed a pulling sensation and it was hard to stretch. At this point I would be on the 24 hour mark. I freaked out. Its kind of a significant swelling. Earlier that day I did not notice any swelling. There was some discoloration in my skin. It was like an oval rectangular shape. The tissue was really soft and squishy. At that point I did take Ibuprofen. I just continued to iced it because I continued with the discomfort. The second day, the injection site did feel tender and sore as well. By the 4th day I did not feel anything. No pain. It was absolutely gone. The discoloration was gone. A week later after getting the vaccine its when I first had an episode when my heart was doing something weird, like palpitations and I had an anxiety attack. I breathe through it. I felt like I got through it. My blood pressure and pulse were high. 3 or 4 days after the second week I had another situation, worse than the first time. I was asleep and I woke up out of my sleep and I was feeling weird, my heart was doing the same weird thing. It reminded me when I got Covid. I started feeling shortness of breath. I immediately checked my blood pressure and oxygen. The readings were super high. I was feeling like I was going to go unconscious. I called 911 because I was by myself and my daughter. They came home and they evaluated me. My blood pressure had come down. They said they did not see any heart situation going on but that does not mean there is not something going on. They wanted me to go to the hospital but I could not go because I had to take care of my daughter. I told them I would call if necessary. I tried to calm myself with teas and meditations. Currently I find myself tired and wanting to sleep a lot. I am still dealing with anxiety. A week and a half after I called the doctor because I was outside and I had a feeling of a stabbing needle. I looked at my arm and there was no bump or anything but my vein was bulged out. I felt like all my veins were popping out. They said it was like a spasm.",,,,,,,,,N,08/17/2021,08/17/2021,0,None,PVT,,None,None,None,,vsafe,2,09/10/2021,,,Y,Seasonal allergies

1689379,09/10/2021,NY,44.0,44,,F,,"Immediately during and after receiving the Janssen shot in my upper left arm, I felt a burning sensation that radiated outwards from the point of entrance of the needle to my whole upper left arm (about the size of my right hand holding my upper arm). This burning sensation occurred for about 15 minutes after the shot and then stopped. After coming home about an hour after the shot, I had swelling and felt pain in my left arm radiating from the point of the shot down into my fingers which I had expected as a common side effect. However, about 30 minutes after that my left hand began to tremble uncontrollably and was extremely weak. The only time my left hand has trembled and had been so weak was after my work related accident and at the beginning of physical therapy for both of my hands (I had weakness in the right hand too, but regained 80% of its strength in my right hand and about 50 to 60% of strength in my left due to 5 years of physical therapy). Prior to this vaccine both my hands were pain free and did not have severe nor mild trembling and I only had mild trembling in my left hand when there were severe rains or if I overexerted my left hand while crocheting, knitting, or typing of which I have not done any for several months now. Also I had terrible pains down my legs and back during the night which resulted in cold sweat throughout my entire body for 2 hours. Once again I do experience painful cold sweats but only during severe weather (rain or extreme cold) or when I have overexerted myself (i.e. walked too much, sat for more than 30 minutes, or stood up for more than 15 minutes).  My nerves in my legs, back, arms, basically throughout my entire body felt like they were on fire and throbbing. I had to just grit my teeth and let my tears run down my face until the pain stopped. I couldn?t move to get up, shift positions, sit, or anything else. My daughter checked to see if I had a fever and I was 98.0 F, so no fever. All this was nerve pain. It was horrible, I haven't had nerve pain throughout my whole entire body before, but I know what it feels like to have nerve pain in my legs and back and left arm/hand, and this felt like that but worse because I couldn?t move. I don?t know if it was this bad because I had  pre-existing nerve damage in my lower back, legs, hands/wrists, and left arm, but it was the worst feeling and experience with pain that I have ever had (and I had 4 children naturally). Other than the nerve pains I had a severe headache and was extremely tired. Thankfully I am feeling better today, September 10th, 2021. I no longer have any pain in my arm, no headaches, nor tiredness. However, I still have trembling albeit a mild trembling, hopefully the trembling will also stop. Now I am back to my normal unbearable lower back, sciatica, and knee pains of which are very hard on me physically to begin with.

She noted that anything she ?puts in her body? to include immunizations, and medications may provoke profound episodes of anxiety.  She denied any history of suspected adverse reactions to vaccines, but reported significant concern that she would have marked anxiety in association with the COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed the vaccine with the patient, and encouraged her to have something to eat and drink prior to vaccination.  Offered option of deferring vaccination on the lanai and choosing a different time/place of her comfort for vaccination.  The patient obtained lunch and returned with desire to proceed with vaccination.   We discussed a plan for a conservative 30min observation period post-vaccination.   Immediately upon vaccination, the patient's administering team noted the patient to be visibly shaking. She reported feeling unwell/dizzy.  She reported tongue numbness, indigestion, GI upset and feeling anxious.  She noted that her symptoms were consistent with prior episodes of marked anxiety.  She was provided a glass of water and an ice pack to her neck.  The  team obtained serial VS, which were notable for BPs in the 140s/80s and HRs in the 80s-90s.    The patient was speaking easily in full sentences, and seemed to relax when distracted with conversation about her move to HI from WA, her children, and her Son?s planned Birthday party.  When not distracted with other topics, the patient expressed concern about her sxs, with corresponding increases in jittering/shaking of her legs.   At patient request, the vaccination team phoned her Husband, who joined the patient .  Upon her Husband?s arrival, I asked him if he had observed the patient look and feel similarly to her symptoms on the lanai.  He reported that indeed, he had been with the patient experiencing the same sxs ?on many occasions?.  He immediately felt the patient?s radial pulse, and noted that her appearance and sxs were consistent with prior episodes of anxiety.    The patient expressed that with prior similar episodes, her Husband?s support and talking have helped to speed resolution of sxs.   She notably had no ocular sxs, nasal sxs, oral sxs, throat sxs, difficulty breathing, or dermatologic sxs.  My colleague and I had assessed the patient prior to her Husband?s arrival. Soon after the patient?s Husband?s arrival, I needed to attend a meeting, and therefore my colleague assumed care for the patient.   Upon my return to the vaccine site approx 45min after my departure, I learned that the patient had markedly improved once her Husband had arrived. After symptom improvement, the patient and her spouse had walked around the vaccine site, walked within the A/C building, and spoke with the vaccine team prior to departing the area.

On Tuesday, 9/7/21, I was seen at a local urgent care facility to be evaluated and treated for my rashes/hives. The provider diagnosed my condition as contact dermatitis, prescribed me Methylprednisolone 4 mg Dospak and recommended that I make an appointment with my dermatologist.

During the visit, I mentioned being seen by my primary care doctor on Saturday, 8/21/21 after experiencing a severe facial rash/hives earlier that week since it occurred after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (received on Thursday, 8/12/21). I did not piece the events together until my urgent care visit. It seemed like the facial rash appeared more delayed following the first dose of the vaccine. I experienced more severe itching, inflammation and pain/discomfort over the next couple days. On Thursday, 9/9/21, I visited my dermatologist who examined me and said the rashes/hives appear to be a drug reaction and/or dermal hypersensitivity (possibly related to the COVID-19 vaccine). The doctor advised me to continue the Methylprednisolone Dospak, take Zyrtec 10 mg one (1) capsule once a day in the morning and Benadryl 25 mg one to two (1-2) capsules once a day in the evening and stop all unnecessary medications and supplements (e.g., no Ibuprofen, Tylenol, Colace, prenatal vitamins). She also prescribed Triamcinolone 0.1% Ointment 454 gm (apply to affected areas 2-3x a day for up to three weeks) and recommended applying Vaseline to the sensitive areas where ointment cannot be applied (face, underarms and groin area).

As with all flu seasons and pandemics the pure pressure of getting the vaccine became a life changing event on October 12th, 1999. I received the flu shot at about 3:30pm after work, at work. I drove home with no problem; I needed to get ready as my sister and future brother-in-law were coming over for dinner. Around 5:30 pm, I had rush of adrenaline to my body, can?t breathe, skin crawling, fire shooting through palms, fire shooting through spine, throat feeling like it is closing, dizziness, ears ringing, and world closing in on me, unable to comprehend my surroundings.  I walked outside my apartment trying to catch my breath and could not focus. I recalled feeling like a mind body separation, unable to focus on surroundings and dizziness.  I returned back to my apartment and told my girlfriend, Sister and Boyfriend who were over for dinner that I need to go to the hospital, something is seriously wrong with me. around 6 pm I arrived at hospital told doctor aforementioned, asked numerous questions, have I had any medications, surgery?s, in the past 24 hours etc.. Then they asked if I had a flu shot, I had not even correlated the two together. I responded yes, and then I was told I was having an (Anaphylaxis Reaction)  I was told I would be given a shot, I remember them saying, and it was Epinephrine, Benadryl, and prednisone. It was about 15 minutes and everything stopped pretty quickly, but heart was pounding. Not sure what time I was released but it was late. I did not sleep well that night, but I had to be at work the next day, gotta pay bills right! I went to work the next day October 13, 1999 at roughly 7:30am, the sun came up and put a little heat on my skin. I reached into my work truck for my sunscreen and attempted to put it on. I remember feeling the warmth of the sun and then BAM, I felt like I was having the reaction all over again. This time I did not feel the shooting fire through my hand and spine. I could not catch my breath, felt like something was seriously wrong. I was having this mind body separation feeling, hard to focus or catch a train of thought. Told my co-worker I need to go back to the office. I remember closing my eyes and trying to work on breathing the whole trip back.  I called the hospital and remember them saying I need to follow up with my doctor. Tried calling my doctor and said I need to see him, explained what had happened and I do remember feeling stuck in this panic mode and not being able to focus, dizziness, heart palpitations and ringing in my ears. I was able to see my doctor on October 13th, do not know what time it was. I had tinnitus, ringing in the ears, itching skin, heart palpitations, and serious mental confusion. I was a mess. He said I had something called Biphasic Anaphylaxis, nothing is written in my charts, but that is what I remember being told. Didn?t really matter at the time, how do fix this was my feeling. I tried to go to work hoping I would get through this, but had to take time off! October 14th, No improvement, I was in complete misery! October 15th, No improvement, I was in complete misery! October 16th, No improvement, I was in complete misery! October 17th, Back to ER, Still in complete misery! October 18th, No improvement, I was in complete misery! October 19th, No improvement, I was in complete misery! I remember having multiple episodes where I couldn?t breathe and having major panic attacks. Could not focus, and thought the world was coming to an end again. I was having real trouble staying at work and performing my job. I remember my boss asking if I am going to be alright, he was truly concerned as I was the top worker and my production was zero. October 19, 1999 I was finally able to see Dr. again. I was not sleeping and none of my symptoms had subsided.  I remember crying in his office, Dr. put his hand on my shoulder and said you?re going to be ok; you are going to get through this. Dr. went into a cabinet and gave me a trial Ativan, and within a short time things settled down except the light ringing in the ears. He told me he was going to refer me to a psychiatrist to get this all figured out. Ativan was working but I was still having multiple problems so Dr. said I need to see a Psychiatrist if I am going to be on this long term. I was referred to Dr. through the insurance.

1690152,09/10/2021,CA,64.0,64,,F,,"At 10 pm I started getting uncontrollably shaky.  I could not calm down - teeth chattering - full body shaking.  My husband covered me with an extra blanket until I could stop... which did happen within 20 minutes and I was able to sleep. ... until around 2 am.  I looked because I did not want to get out of bed because I felt weak...but I thought I had to vomit... so I tried to get up to make it to the bathroom.  I stood up and fell on the ground.  My legs could not support me.  I started moaning.  I told my husband I had to vomit and he encouraged me to crawl to the bathroom on scoot and fall at a time.  When what seemed like forever I got to the tile floor, I laid my head on the tile and it felt so good that I crawled the rest of my unclothed body on the tile.  And stayed there sweating profusely for what my hubby said was 40 minutes.  I can't recall that much time.  But when I woke up I was in a puddle of liquid.  My chest was dripping wet and my back was in a puddle.  My husband thinks I peed, but it's unknown if I could actually sweat that much or if I had an involuntary pee that I can't recall.   But when I got up I made it back to the bed without vomiting (the urge passed) and slept until morning.  In morning I felt weak but ok.  Able to eat and function, etc.  I felt good enough by afternoon to strip bed and wash towels that hubby used to dry floor.  It was a huge scare.  In retrospect maybe I had a 24 hour covid?  I had gone to jury duty that morning with 400 other masked people in a big room....    In the weeks that followed I had more heart palpitations than usual.   I call them heart murmurs but not sure what they are.

The reporter considered the necrosis, shoulder injury related to vaccine administration, injected limb mobility decreased, injection site pain, shoulder pain, localized muscle weakness, shoulder bursitis, impingement syndrome, bursa disorder and foreign body reaction to be related to Influenza vaccine.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) in a female patient aged between 50 to 51 years, who was vaccinated with unspecified Influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was right-handed schoolteacher. No information on patient's family history or medical history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified Influenza vaccine in right deltoid (Route of administration unknown; batch number not provided; dosage unknown). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient reported 3 months of severe right shoulder pain. The patient described the experience as being traumatic because of multiple redirections of the needle while injecting the vaccine. The patient presented for evaluation of her right shoulder. The patient developed severe shoulder pain and weakness over the next 48 hours; the pain was most pronounced with attempted shoulder elevation. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with rotator cuff bursitis and impingement syndrome. The patient presented with bursal foreign body reaction. Oral medication consisting of therapeutic doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed but did not result in any appreciable benefit. The patient was subsequently treated with a cortisone subacromial injection and referred to physical therapy for rotator cuff-specific exercises. This resulted in only temporary reduction in her symptoms, so a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the shoulder was ordered. The MRI revealed evidence of severe shoulder bursitis with a large volume of fluid and solid-appearing heterogeneous bodies that extended throughout the subacromial space. There was no evidence of rotator cuff tear. On review of the MRI, the patient was sent to the shoulder subspecialty clinic for evaluation. Her physical examination was unchanged from the initial visit. Specifically, the patient had significant evidence of shoulder bursitis and shoulder pain with minimal motion especially when attempted overhead. The patient had limited range of motion as a result of pain, this was most pronounced with attempted forward flexion and/or abduction. The patient's active elevation, neutral external rotation, and abduction were 90 degree, 25 degree, and 70 degree respectively. Her external rotation strength was 4/5 and the patient was neurovascularly intact. No erythema or warmth was noted. The patient had a positive empty can shoulder test. After discussion with the patient, it was determined that the best course of action would be to perform an extensive arthroscopic surgical debridement of her subacromial space and biopsy of heterogenous loose bodies noted on the MRI. Therefore, the patient underwent an arthroscopic shoulder debridement, subacromial bursectomy, and intraoperative cultures of the bursal tissue. At the time of surgery, the patient was noted to have extensive inflammation in the bursal space. In addition, the patient had multiple white, hardened caseous-appearing material in the shoulder. This material was distinct from the bursae. These relatively large bodies were evacuated from the shoulder subacromial space and sent for culture and histologic analysis. Next, the rotator cuff was evaluated and noted to be intact. Her glenohumeral joint was evaluated and found to have a normal appearance without any significant abnormality. The patient noted significant relief in her symptoms after surgery. At 3-month postoperative checkup, her active forward flexion, neutral external rotation, and abduction were 165 degree, 70 degree, and 130 degree, respectively. The patient had no pain with shoulder motion in any plane, and her external rotation strength at neutral was 5/5. The patient progressed through physical therapy without significant difficulty. Histologic analysis of the loose bodies was revealed to have reactive changes and with areas of tissue necrosis. This was noted to be atypical of synovial or bursal tissue. Cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth. The authors commented, ""The deltoid is the primary site of administration of the inactivated influenza vaccine for children and adults. Transient pain at the injection site and deltoid muscle are the most common chief complaints after vaccine administration. However, persistent pain and limited range of motion are uncommon and should raise suspicion for a reactive inflammatory process in the shoulder joint. Since the mid-2010s, claims of SIRVA to the Compensation Program have increased substantially. In addition, orthopedic surgery has been shown to be the most common secondary provider in evaluation of SIRVA. Thus, it is pertinent that orthopedic surgeons are aware of the presentation and management of SIRVA. SIRVA should be suspected when a patient, without prior shoulder complaints, reports a history of rapid-onset, persistent shoulder pain possibly associated with weakness and decreased range of motion within 48 hours of vaccine administration. The literature shows that SIRVA is often related to vaccine administration ��too high'' in the deltoid muscle, which can increase the risk of injecting into the shoulder joint or bursa or improper injection angle or redirection as seen in our patient. These factors of improper deltoid muscle referencing, angle of injection, and needle selection have led several groups to propose vaccine administration guidelines specifically to prevent SIRVA. Of note, although SIRVA is most often caused by the influenza vaccine, it is not isolated to the inactivated influenza vaccine alone and has been shown to be caused by other vaccine types delivered in the deltoid muscle such as the pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23), herpes zoster, Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis), and human papillomavirus vaccines. Our patient had the unique finding of hardened, chalklike flakes that represented reactive changes and fibrinoid necrosis that had not previously been described in the literature. It is likely that this was the resultant effect of inadvertent injection of influenza vaccine into the subacromial bursa. We recommend removal of these foreign bodies if surgery is performed."" The authors concluded, ""SIRVA is an uncommon complication of deltoid vaccine administration that can present with symptoms and imaging that mimic other etiologies of shoulder dysfunction. Failed conservative management could be treated with arthroscopic shoulder debridement of inflamed soft tissue and bone, while obtaining cultures and pathology to rule out infection. In addition, we recommend postoperative physical therapy to achieve functional and symptomatic recovery.""",,,,,,,,,U,,,,"Test Name: Cultures; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:negative for bacterial or fungal growth,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: Histologic analysis; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: elevation, neutral external rotation, and abduction test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Test Name: magnetic resonance image; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:); Comments: The MRI revealed evidence of severe shoulder bursitis with a large volume of fluid and solid-appearing heterogeneous bodies that extended throughout the subacromial space.

On an unspecified date, the patient was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). The complete blood count showed hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit 36.3 percent, white blood white blood cell count 10.9 x10exp3 cells/microL, and significant severe thrombocytopenia 2x10exp9/L, her international normalized ratio was 1.02, with a prothrombin time of 13.5 seconds and a partial thromboplastin time of 27.0 seconds. The hemolytic workup was completed with lactate dehydrogenase 150 U/L, haptoglobin 192 mg/dL, and D-dimer was 0.76. On admission, the patient received 2 units of platelets. She was also given a one time dose of prednisone 60 mg orally. Her repeat platelet count post transfusion improved to 14x10exp9 /L. The hematology was consulted and recommended starting the patient on immune globulin (human) infusion intravenously and dexamethasone 20 mg daily. Throughout admission, the patient's platelet count steadily increased. She did not have further bleeding episodes and did not require additional platelet transfusions. The testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C was negative. The patient's heparin-induced platelet IgG antibody was negative. Imaging including ultrasound Doppler of the abdomen/pelvis, ultrasound Doppler of upper and lower extremities, magnetic resonance venogram of the head, and computed tomography angiography of the thorax showed no evidence of thrombosis. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission with no signs of active bleeding. She was ultimately deemed stable for discharge 5 days after admission, with a platelet count of 252x10exp9 /L. The number of days of hospitalization was reported as 5. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient was recovering from immune thrombocytopenia purpura, and the outcome of muscle soreness at the administration site was not reported.  The Authors discussed to the best of their knowledge, this was the first case of an individual with no other identifiable cause experiencing ITP after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen; Johnson & Johnson) vaccine. The possibility of vaccination triggered de novo ITP could not be excluded; however, the abrupt occurrence 17 days after vaccine administration and a severe drop in platelets to 2 x 10exp9 /L raise concern for drug-induced thrombocytopenia.  The Authors believed with widespread distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, additional surveillance and analysis of data are needed to determine the true correlation or causation of severe thrombocytopenia after vaccination.
