I followed the directions & added Benadryl at bedtime. The next day on Thursday  the inflammation from the hive went down, but it remained bright red & felt hot to the touch. I used the cream & Benadryl that night. On Friday when I woke up the redness was nearly gone, but there was still discoloration and an added reddened area on my arm near the bend of my arm. It looked like a white ring was formed around the discolored hive area. Saturday it started to itch & got inflamed some more. A half circle shaped hive appeared around the original hive spot. I used hydrocortisone cream & took Benadryl at bedtime. This morning when I woke up it looked like a bullseye rash like from a tick bite! It has still been itchy some & others told me it feels warmer to the touch than the rest of my arm. I have taken pictures each day for documenting purposes that I can email you all.

I asked what medications are related to PCN & the pharmacist named augmentin & amoxicillin-I?ve had both without issues. She said there is a very rare side effect being reported in folks with a PCN allergy. She said she was puzzled by the fact my reaction was late onset & suggested I report this.

During the call, determined that it was the REGN10933 component which is casirivimab 300 mg/2.5 single-dose vials were in a box instead of Moderna vaccine. Mistake was noticed when the pharmacist vaccinators at three other vaccination locations that evening called the center to report they received incorrect vials. Upon notification, alerts went to other sites receiving vaccine and the error was identified. At the original storage site, vials of casirivimab and vials of Moderna vaccine were stored side by side in the refrigerator as both require refrigeration. It should be notified that the box of casirivimab was shipped separately from the rest of the Regenerol mAbs product without notification; therefore, arrival of this box was not anticipated. When the people came to pick up the vaccine, vials of both drugs were taken for re-distribution to vaccination site locations. It should be noted that the shipping boxes used for both drugs are identical on the outside; the packing list inside the box identifies box contents. The boxes for the vaccine inside the shipping boxes are marked. The labels for both of the Regeneron mAbs drugs (casirivimab and imdevirmab) are poorly label for identification having letters and numbers instead of the drug name on the vials: vials do say 2.5 mL. The Moderna vial does not list total volume of contents but rather (10 doses of 0.5 mL per dose).

The contributing factors/cause Included: Wholesaler shipping boxes for the vaccine and monoclonal antibodies look identical. Hospital was supposed to receive 216 vials of casirivimab and 216 vials of imdevimab, but received a partial shipment of casirivimab. The wholesaler sent a 2nd shipping box of casirivimab that was not expected. Staffing shortages at the hospital. Vials stored next to each other in the refrigerator. Picked up the ""red top"" vials and delivered them to multiple vaccination sites. Four sites received both casirivimab and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the same delivery, of which one site inadvertently administered the casirivimab to 44 patients instead of the intended Moderna vaccine.

The next day my mom was given a sheet with the correct instructions from Pfizer that say to dilute with 1.8mL to obtain 5 doses/vial. She told her boss that she would only do what the sheet says and dilute correctly but her boss was telling all the nurses to dilute with 1.9mL and get 6-7 doses/vial. My mom talked to me and I told her to report it. She let her boss's boss know and I guess the big boss decided what the boss was doing was an ok practice.

She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it's still a little bit swollen. She didn't expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn't have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it's not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn't have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy.

In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning.

I have woken up several times in the middle of the night (i.e., 2 am, 4 am, etc..). Each time I have woken up and felt wide awake and difficulty going back to sleep.  As a consequence each of the following days after this poor sleep I have been in extreme fatigue and not able to function properly.  I do not have any other notable side effects.  No fever or major headaches.  This disturbed sleep which coincidentally started right after the vaccination is highly concerning for me, especially since it has happened on 4 consecutive nights.  This has not happened to me before.  In the past even if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would fall back asleep relatively quickly.  Furthermore, it has not been the case of this type of lack of sleep for this many consecutive nights. Another observation is that my feeling of hunger seems to have increased for some reason.  Even in the middle of the night when I wake up I have felt great hunger and then starting in the morning that hunger continues.  This is more hunger than normal for me.  My diet and eating patterns have not changed compared to what it was before getting the first dose of the vaccination. Given that today is Martin Luther King Day and a Holiday my PCP is closed, so could not make an appointment or report this to her.  I will call my PCP again tomorrow, 01/19/21.

The MAs I work with were asking if I was ok and other questions and I felt as though I wanted to answer them but couldn't get any words out. This lasted a short while and then I was able to answer them. They said I was very pale and my body felt like I could have just slid out of my chair and onto the floor, I also had some chest pressure and fatigue. A nurse came over to my desk to check me out, she asked the infusion room to come over and start and IV of fluids and some Zofran. They checked my glucose (122) after lunch, bp was normal. They got the stretcher and got me into an exam room and ran an EKG and called EMS for transport to the ED. When I got to the ED they ran an EKG, did lab work, continued IV fluids, gave me meclizine. They released me that night around 8pm and advised me to follow up with my PCP the next day. I called my PCP as instructed the next day. Due to the holiday I was set up with a video visit with my PCP on 1/4/2021. By this time my dizziness had improved and I was only dizzy with quick positional changes. The fatigue was worse and I had a sore throat, congested sinuses, loose stools, nausea, headache and occasional productive cough.

At approximately 5:10 pm, while driving to our home, about 45 minutes after receiving the injection, we both noticed that we were having difficulty swallowing and felt a swelling in the back of our throats. My husband experienced a metallic taste. The feeling of the swelling in our throats was similar to when a dentist uses a topical numbing gel prior to a dental procedure. The difficulty swallowing and the thickness in our throats lasted about 30 - 45 minutes. We monitored ourselves at home and did not feel that we needed medical attention. Because of my angioedema I had 2 Epipens at the ready. We both experienced soreness at the injection site (left arm), my husband's sorer than mine. The swollen throat and difficulty swallowing is the only reaction I had. My husband woke on Sunday morning and his arm was very sore, more so than what he has experienced with a flu shot. At approximately 12:15 pm on Sunday, 1/17/21, and about 21 hours after the vaccine was administered, my husband began to feel achy, like he was getting a cold. He took a nap and upon waking did not feel any better. His temperature was 97.6. He felt lethargic the rest of the day and went to bed early and sleep ok but woke up not feeling any better.

Was it the insurance company that would pay- would his supplement pay for this or what. He would probably have another question- how would he know if he has had an allergic reaction to the ingredients. The ingredients were listed he believed that Pfizer would have to know because he did not know what the listing ingredients were, he didn't know if he has ever had an MRNA lipid vaccine or anything like that. He would start with whether or not he's going to have to pay for the vaccine. Then on 08Jan2021, it was reported that after the 1st one, the patient had swelling of arm and pain (arm pain) after the first COVID vaccine dose, both on unspecified dates.

The vaccine site was swollen and hot for about 7 days.  Deep shoulder pain began along with excessive Ibuprofen use to try to manage pain.  Sleep difficulties due to waking with severe, deep shoulder pain that lasted for hours.  10/05/2020 - Office Visit with PCP/NP due to shoulder pain. Diagnostic tests and referrals were discussed.  Cause was unknown at the time.  No previous history of shoulder pain and/or injury.  X-rays were taken in the office to determine if a fracture or dislocation had occurred.  Neither were present on the x-ray.  PCP/NP prescribed Gabapentin and Lidocaine for pain.  She instructed me to discontinue Ibuprofen due to concern that I was experiencing possible abdominal symptoms related to the overuse of Ibuprofen.  PA discussed options, including MRI and PT, if pain continued.   10/23/2020 - Follow-up office visit with PCP/NP. Gabapentin was discontinued after first day due to side effects. Referred to a pain specialist. Flu vaccine prior to the shoulder pain was addressed.  12/03 - MRI completed as ordered by Pain Specialist, Dr. MRI Findings are:  FINDINGS: *Moderate Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus Tendinosis with mild adjacent fluid in the subdeltoid subacromial bursa suggesting bursitis.  *A 13 mm x 14 mm tear of the supraspinatus tendon. *Mild atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle. *Type 2 curved acromial configuration without undersurface spurring. *Advanced cartilage loss in the acromioclavicular joint with mild adjacent spurring. *Mild to moderate capsular thickening and increased signal suggesting adhesive capsulitis.  12/08/2020 - Follow-up visit with Dr. - recommendation of Physical Therapy 2-3 times weekly for 8 weeks to support self-healing of the supraspinatus tear if possible.

I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination.

Nausea, dry heaving to the point I almost vomited 2x.  After napping, nausea returned slightly but immediately went away.  Felt very tired remainder of the evening. 1/18/21-Went to MD to get clearance to return to work.  Dizziness prior to visit and took 1/2 25 mg Meclizine.  Felt better until I got to doctor's office.  While waiting to be called back, dizziness started up again and got severe.  While waiting on MD to come in and talk to me, I got nauseated and felt like I might dry heave/vomit.  I took another 1/2 Meclizine 25 mg and sucked on a mentholated cough drop to help with nausea, which did subside.  Dizziness continued to be severe.  MD took blood pressure, pulse ox, checked my ears, checked my pupils, listened to me breathe, asked me about my symptoms, return to work, and advised on safety of taking 2nd COVID injection when it is time but leaving it up to me in terms of if I feel benefits outweigh possible side effects of 2nd injection.  He prescribed anti-nausea meds, pain meds, and stated he wants to see me for a follow-up visit in 1 week.  He also prescribed steroid and pain med injections to be administered in office immediately, steroid injection sometimes contains Benadryl and based on how I felt after the shot, there may have been Benadryl in this one.  He also requested I message him later in the day to let him know how I was feeling.  Injections did GREATLY assist with pain and dizziness/foggy-headed feeling, once they kicked in.  I did message him letting him know how I was feeling after napping. 1/18/21 evening-I am still feeling weak and tired and having stinging like pain in both legs along with minor lower back pain.  Some chest and throat irritation as well as stomach discomfort.  Going to take a gentle laxative as well as some of the nighttime cold medicine I purchased.  Still also having dizziness on and off.  I plan to return to work tentatively, on 1/19/21, per my return to work note from MD.

No information was provided regarding medical history, concurrent conditions, or concomitant medications.  In or around 2013, the patient was inoculated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (lot#, expiration date, dose, strength, dose# and route not specified) for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). Shortly after receiving zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the patient suffered shingles. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the patient's symptoms had resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX). The patient also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of her condition. As a result of the manufacture, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and/or sale of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, the patient suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient had suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. The outcome of the event of shingles was considered to be not recovered and causal relationship was assessed as related.

I also had moderate pain at injection site.  This was about the size of a half dollar.  On the morning of 1/6 I still didn't feel well.  I received a call from my mom that she tested positive for COVID and although I did not have much contact with her there was one day on 12/26 that I saw her outside for about 15 minutes (masked).  I called employee health with all of this as it was hard to separate the exposure from symptoms of the vaccine.   I did express some concerns over having a vaccine reaction but was told the symptoms I was having would be normal.  I was tested for COVID, which was negative.  Over the next few days symptoms got better but I did have nausea on and off until the morning of 1/11.  Redness at injection site, swelling and pain were resolved by 1/11 as well.  On Friday 1/15 I woke up and my injection site was red, warm, swollen, and had pain again.  This was about the size of a quarter.  There was also a hard area that could be felt under the skin.  My arm hurt with radiating pain into my wrist.  I thought maybe it was just random and it would go away.  It slowly resolved through out the day and was mostly gone by Saturday 1/16/21.  The only thing left was a faded red area about the size of a nickel.  Friday evening ,1/15, I started to not feel well with body aches, joint pain, headache, and pain from injection site that radiated to my chest (this was intermittent).  I also had a low grade fever (highest temp 99.9).

I just wanted to pass on some side effects and i did not go on the agency website which i should have to report them. I had a headache off and on the first week. the first day afterward i had a 100 degree fever as well. I never have sleep issues (falling asleep etc) i had insomnia and could not sleep and didnt sleep well for around a week. What i noticed most though is it really affected my stomach and i was awakened with acid reflux several times. the muscles of my stomach were sore like i had been coughing (but hadn't) and i had no desire for food, only fruit, light watery things. as soon as i eat anything i have stomach pain digesting. Since last weekend i sleep way too much, even if i set the alarm i turn it off and keep sleeping. I try to walk and get out.  when i wake up it seems my stomach has been really active, i have a horrible taste in my mouth and acid reflux liquid in my through.  Just letting you know; and I have the 2nd shot so fingers crossed i'll come through all of this. Take care as well.

On day 1-2, I was extremely exhausted, so exhausted that I actually wet the bed and I have NEVER wet the bed as an adult, which was extremely embarrassing.  The worst part is, since the shot, day 1, my eye has been twitching. I have been reporting it .  I do not think it is just a coincidence anymore like I originally thought.  I have had eye twitches in the past but they have never lasted this long!  It has been 3 weeks and there is no end in sight.  The time between twitches is sometimes less, but the severity of the twitching is getting more intense, sometimes causing my eye to blink (although usually its a lateral upper eyelid twitch) and I have had 1-2 instances of my upper lip twitching along with it (within the last couple of days).  The eye is driving me crazy.  I can't fall asleep at night because it keeps me awake and it twitches when I'm trying to fall asleep.  There has been nothing that has changed in terms of increased stress, increased caffeine consumption, decreased sleep, etc. to have explained this persistent eye twitching.  I did have my annual eye exam on 1/15/2021 and talked to him about it and he said we will continue to watch it.

He was found to have significant tracheal stenosis during this hospitalization.    He presented with symptoms of progressively noisy breathing and muted voice which culminated in an episode of severe respiratory distress with increased secretions and work of breathing. He previously had been on a thickened diet but was cleared by OT to take un-thickened breastmilk after a swallow study had been reassuring against aspiration in June. In the week prior, he had also been transitioned from a preemie nipple to larger size nipple. On the day of presentation, he had also incidentally received his 2nd flu shot prior to respiratory decompensation.    In the ED he had oxygen saturation in the low 70s, pronounced work of breathing with tracheal tugging, intercostal and subcostal retractions, and biphasic stridor. He had significant improvement after 1 dose of racemic epi, dexamethasone, and initiation of high-flow nasal cannula on 8 L at 40% FiO2. He was initially transitioned to the floor, but soon became significantly more agitated, tachycardic to the 180s, with recurrence of significant work of breathing, coarse lung sounds, intermittent stridor, self-resolving desaturation to the low 80s.  He was given an additional dose of racemic epinephrine due to concern for possible atypical presentation of anaphylaxis. Vital signs improved but given recurrence of respiratory distress, he was transferred to the PICU.   In the PICU he received 2 further doses of dexamethasone and two nighttime doses of racemic epinephrine for initial concern for croup.  He did not have any further episodes of respiratory distress, continued to improve symptomatically, and vitals stabilized. ENT performed bedside laryngoscopy which revealed a posterior vocal fold notch concerning for glottic and/or subglottic stenosis. He was transferred to the floor on 1/10.   Due to concern for aspiration, on 1/11 Pt underwent a video fluoroscopic swallow study, at which time he was found to have fatigue-related pharyngeal phase dysphagia, vocal fold hypomobility, and VF notch. He also had baseline chest rattle and congestion that increased during feeding. These findings were concerning for potential aspiration, so OT recommended returning to half nectar-thickened feeds. On 1/12 ENT performed an exam under anesthesia with micro laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy which revealed complete tracheal rings and severe tracheal narrowing to 2.9 mm.  CT angiogram on 01/13 was consistent with complete tracheal rings and did not show evidence of vascular ring or extrinsic compression by a mediastinal mass.  Pulmonology was consulted and recommended albuterol (for mucus clearance) and CPT/clapping twice daily, and recommended discharge with racemic epinephrine to be used only in case of respiratory emergency while concurrently calling 911. An EpiPen was also provided as an emergency precaution. After joint decision-making with ENT and family, Pt was discharged home on 01/15 for continued discussion of surgical planning for a slide tracheoplasty.  Pt will also follow-up with pulmonology in 4-8 weeks after discharge. He will need pre-operative CHO and outpatient visit with his cardiologist.  He will need a repeat VFSS in 4-6 months.
