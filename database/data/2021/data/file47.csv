These aches felt like painful internal construction of the head neck back and thigh muscles. Severe pain in the left arm where I received the jab.  I was extremely fatigued and could barely make it from bed to the bathroom. I treated the condition with Tylenol 1g every 4hrs followed by 200mg of Motrin. I also ensured adequate fluid hydration and electrolytes 120+ oz per day. The symptoms continued for about 36hrs. I began to feel better but 48hrs later I relapsed with the onset of ringing ears then headache followed by extreme fatigue. I treated the 2nd round with continued bed rest over 3 days with Tylenol (1g) and Motrin (400mg). I eliminated Tylenol day 2. I reduced Motrin to half on Day 3. I felt better for 48hrs and again relapsed but only needed smaller 200mg doses of Motrin for a day along with bed rest.

The ringing in the ears is less after min of 6hrs full sleep during the night. I have yet to be able to exercise since racing that 2nd dose.

When I tried to sign the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card, I noticed that she received Pfizer-BioNTech.  I explained to her that she received Moderna by mistake.  I also told her that since both mRNA vaccine products are engineered with the same technology, she might not need to repeat the second dose.  And I observed her for about 30 minutes.  I told her that I would find out if she needed to repeat it.  I contacted the Immunization Action Coalition and they told me that as long as the pt had received mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products, pt would not need to repeat a dose.  They also sent me the CDC info on this recommendation.  But the CDC guideline is not clear to me since she received the two doses 21 days apart, not 28 days.  So I emailed a vaccine expert at the CDC, who I usually email whenever I have an immunization question.   I called the pt around 2 pm (two hours after vaccination) and she seemed to be doing fine at that time.   I gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she had any concerns.

Medical history included allergies: Penicillin, Ampicillin, hair color product. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. She was allergic to Penicillin, and Ampicillin. As a child, always reacted strongly to any vaccination she was given with a fever and flu like symptoms for a couple of days. With Ampicillin, she thought she was having a heart attack. Was told to stop Ampicillin immediately because she could get a heart attack. This was when she was 25 years old and she never went to the ER. She was allergic to a hair color product in the 1990s and it made her scalp itch really badly. Was given a cortisone shot, which she reacted immediately breaking out head to toe in hives. Has no NDC/LOT/EXP for the vaccinations she reacted strongly to as a child. Stated this was in the 1950s or early 1960s. Clarified she did not have a heart attack with Ampicillin, but it felt like she was having one. Has had cardiograms per her request and her heart and heart walls are perfect. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine at 8:30 a.m. this morning on 26Mar2021. Caller reports around 11 a.m., she experienced excruciating leg cramping going from her buttock down behind her knee and rolling to the inside of her thigh, states that the pain lasted 15 minutes. The patient reports the same pain occurred on the opposite leg around noon and lasted for 15 minutes, states that ""the pain was so excruciating that she could barely stand up and it was so agonizing it was unbelievable."" The patient noticed that the inside of her thighs were a little red on the side, both legs from her thighs to her knees. The patient states that she has not been in the sun, and didn't think it was anything alarming, but this is abnormal for her, states that she received the vaccine in the right arm and her upper torso is fine and her head is clear, asked if anyone else had reported this reaction. She was planned to received the second dose on 16thApr in the early afternoon. The patient stated the COVID shot was already fogging her mind. The patient felt pretty good after first shot. Felt nothing. Fifteen minutes before leaving the diner she got a leg cramp. Was sitting in a booth and didn't think much of it. Attributed it to the way she was sitting. Around 11AM when she got back to her garage, she was in agony. It hurt from the top of her rear all the way down the side to the back of her knee and rolled to the inside of her thigh. She was in such agony and didn't know if she could get out of her chair and walk. By the time she reached her apartment it has subsided. An hour later, same thing happened in the left leg. She was laying in bed and texting because she didn't' know if she would get any other reaction. This leg cramp was even worse. She was in tears. Got off bed to try and walk it off. Initial leg cramp happened in right leg. Was excruciating. Both times it lasted for 15 minutes. Both cramps were from her buttocks, all down to her knees, and rolled over into her thigh. Didn't know if that was a reaction. It is not typical of anything written on Pfizer's information or that she had heard. She was concerned. Heard about blood clots, but not with this particular product. Stated second leg cramp subsided. If it hadn't, she wouldn't have gone to the ER. Leg cramps was so excruciating. Originally thought it was coincidental and stated she will be 70 on (Date withheld). To say she has never had leg cramps before would be a lie. The way the leg cramps were timed was kind of weird. It was absolutely the same kind of cramp and location just on the a different leg. Weight: Gained 25lbs. Doesn't have COVID or any symptoms. Tested three to four months ago and was negative. Received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine today, 26Mar2021, at 08:30AM. First leg cramp began 11:00AM in right leg. Second leg cramp began Noon in left leg. Each time lasted 15 minutes. Not having leg cramps right now. Could barely talk when having leg cramps. Was worried about getting clots in legs. Otherwise she would think it was because she was getting older. She doesn't get leg cramps very often. Doesn't know when the last time she had leg cramps prior to today. Nurse technician at vaccine faculty stated caller's allergy history wouldn't be a problem and she only had to sit for 15 minutes. Received the COVID-19 Vaccine and hardly felt it. Waited for 15 minutes. She was fine until 11AM. She was fine now, but her arm might get a little stiff tomorrow. Arm was slightly tender. Surprised she felt something in her legs. Doesn't know whether to associate it with COVID-19 Vaccine or not. Has nothing to complain about in the upper torso or from the waist up. Wants to know if this is a reaction or coincidence.

Mine has never been elevated, it's not growth fully elevated like indicative of cardiac event, However, it is elevated so I thought I should report this to Pfizer so I want you to know that, this is unusual finding."" She was on a statin drug, she was on Crestor 5 mg once a day (clarified that she is taking Rosuvastatin Calcium instead of Crestor), however she cut it back to just 3 times a week now because her cholesterol numbers are good, my LDL and HDL are all good and the Cholesterol drug (Intent: Crestor) is known to cause this muscle aches and pain but this is so coincidental with this arm, her left arm where she received vaccine and this CPK being elevated and she thought perhaps Pfizer should be made aware. Consumer stated, ""I have been a nurse, I am retired now, I am 76 but I had been a nurse for 54 years, I was at one time director of nursing, so I am familiar with the healthcare system and most medications but of course this Pfizer vaccine and Moderna and Johnson and Johnson these are brand new, this is a Covid pandemic so. Causality: Consumer stated, I kind of think there is connection there sir, because remember that it could be, muscle damage that elevates your CPK, it could be cardiac muscle, it could be a stroke, neither which I didn't have a heart attack. I was having a lot of muscle pain, prior because of the Crestor but that is the common side effect of any statin drug can cause muscle aches and pains. However, I thought there was quite a connection getting the vaccine in the right arm, not being able to raise my (incomplete sentence) now vaccine was Sunday which was I believe the 21st and this event did not happen until, I was sore Sunday evening but the unable to raise it was Wednesday, which was 3 days later yeah and the blood draw was yesterday morning and this morning my doctor called me to tell me that my CPK was elevated not grossly but enough to make the phone call. Consumer stated, the first one was on 28Feb2021 and the lot number was EN620, I need my magnify glass, there is one right here because it's so small, okay its EN62C or is it 0, it's hard to tell 3 is the last number. The second dose with lot number is EP7534. Consumer stated, Let me just look at the calendar to make sure that was Wednesday, I got the shot on 21st, yes sir, it was the 24th, the arm was sore even that evening the 21st (21Mar2021), evening of the 21st but the inability to move it was Wednesday the 24th, I could not move even move it away from my body so I was guarding it, today it's not as bad, I can move it but I still feel it like up in my shoulder. When confirmed if the event has improved, consumer stated, I would say yes but not totally gone. Consumer stated, I just took Tylenol that's all, I mean what I was going to do, I think I took, I know I took a shower last night Wednesday at night, I might let the warm water run on it, I might have, I don't remember, I took a shower regardless so."" Lab test: Consumer stated, ""I had blood work yesterday all my values were normal, Cholesterol was normal the only thing that was elevated was the CPK."" Consumer stated, ""I thought that it was necessary to report it okay, is there any way you can tell me is this a common occurrence where CPK elevates slightly."" The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for rosuvastatin calcium was dose reduced. The outcome of the events 'arm became sore, unable to raise arm, elevated CPK and muscle trauma (muscle injury)' was recovering while the outcome of the other event was unknown. The reporter considered the events 'arm soreness, unable to raise arm and elevated CPK' as serious (medically significant). The causality of the events 'arm soreness and unable to raise arm' was related to BNT162B2, and event 'elevated CPK' was related to rosuvastatin calcium.; Sender's Comments: Based on a drug event temporal association, the company cannot completely rule out a reasonable possibility that BNT162B2 caused the events.

Subject was scheduled to be admitted at hospital during the first week of April for 28 days. The action taken in response to the event for blinded study vaccine and study vaccine (BNT162B2) was not applicable (reported as dose not changed by the investigator). The outcome of the event was not recovered.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event leukemia was related to study vaccine (BNT162B2), while unrelated to blinded study vaccine, concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.; Sender's Comments: The event ""Leukemia"" is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  The company considers there is not a reasonable possibility that the event, leukemia, is related to vaccine administration based on the known adverse event profile of the suspect product and on the absence of a plausible pathophysiological mechanism by which the vaccine would be expected to cause this event.  Pfizer's safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 15-MAR-2021 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Leukaemia.

I had two days of fever and chills, but that's not why I'm report this.  My taste and smell has been altered since the day after my vaccine. For weaker smells, I don't pick them up at all. Stronger smells either smell excessively sweet or burnt. I can pick up about 20% of the smell of something and the other 80% is this weird sweet or burnt flavor, but never both. Garbage, gasoline, hand sanitizer all have the same sweet smell. Most food smells burnt.  My taste is similar. Some food has a burnt flavor. Beef, previously a favorite food of mine, has a nauseating taste to it that prevents me from eating too much of it.

Patient's pulse and blood pressure was checked. At 4:45pm pulse was at 38 BPM and then at 4:47 pm 55 BPM and blood pressure at 90/60.  This provider then alerted other staff member to call EMS due to abnormal vital signs. EMS did arrive shortly after and then patient was assessed per EMS.

Within  one minute of injection, my head felt really funny, underside of lower arm started itching (the itching went away within a minute or so), chest tightened and felt light headed. Got out of vehicle for some fresh air, was told if dizzy, sit down.  Got back in vehicle and blasted AC and leaned into vent to breathe.  Wave of awful lightheadedness came in spurts, but have NEVER reacted to any other vaccine like this, I convinced myself it must be low blood sugar, even though I tested fine before I left.  I was not nervous, and was in fact, excited to get this vaccine.   After 15 minutes, we leave, grab a bite to eat.  The lightheadedness came in waves and just didn't stop. An hour after, I started sweating and my heart was  switching between what seem like rapid pulse to pounding heartbeat, to the point I could hear it in my ears and when I laid down, it felt like my veins vibrated.  Around 5:30, a friend took me to the ER.  Having had to wait a while, thankfully by the times my vitals were took, everything looked normal.  Was told it was a panic attack and to get the second vaccine.

We called my doctor's office after my right arm and leg became very heavy and awkward. They told me to go to the nearest hospital. When I got there, I presented ass a full stroke. I was very hard to understand and my mouth drooped and I had very little use of my right arm and leg. They ran tests, but could not give me the medication because I was already on Eliquis. They thought they saw a small clot very high up. I was hospitalized over the next four days and improved my speech dramatically after a bad headache on March 30. The doctors go back and forth to whether it was a Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is what my paperwork says and a complex migraine. I do not experience migraines or anything like this ever before.  I did not have a real headache on the 29th. Since my symptoms, right arm and leg difficulties are still here, my Doctor believes it was a stroke.

My mom, who was with me at the time of vaccination, asked the administering pharmacist if I could remove my mask because I was having trouble breathing. Throughout this reaction, the pharmacist froze and was visibly in shock of what was happening. Because of this, my mom began asking me questions to figure out what else I was experiencing. Once I was able to remove the mask and breathe deeply, the reaction subsided after two minutes. The pharmacist, after my reaction began to subside, stated that they had an epipen ready to administer if needed. I was never administered the epipen. The pharmacist asked me to wait 30 minutes instead of the general 15 minutes before leaving the site. Because the symptoms went away and did not return within the 30 minutes, I left the site.

For at least a year they would tense up and be tender constantly.  I had Skelaxin which worked, but I ran out after the first month and suffered for the rest of the year. About 24 hours after the vaccine my gut muscles started to react in severe pain.  Within an hour it as as bad as the accident then it elevated to a dull bit prominent stabling pain in my lower left abdomen area.  Not being completely unsure it wasn't my intestines, I drank some Miralax.  We were really close to a trip to the ER at this moment.  Instead of running laps between the toilet and bed I layed in bed continuously this time.  The pain subsided just a tad, but I was able to doze off for a few seconds at a time and it felt like a miracle. Three hours later I woke, nearly pain free but still very tender.  When I got up I could feel the tenderness a lot, but the pain had subsided.  When I went vertical  I could feel it getting worse again, although very slowly. I proceeded to spend the rest of the day and following day in bed.  I'm still tender but good.

Symptoms of greatest concern: Nausea, Headache, Chills for 1-2 days; and the ongoing Fatigue is now in its 4th day.

Arm Pain: Onset of mild pain in arm that was noticed when not touching the arm; Level of pain was a ?1? out of 10).  An annoying level of pain where the pain ramped up to 3 or 4 on a scale of 10 when the arm was moved about began at 7:00PM on 07APR21 and lasted 12 hours until 7:00AM on 08APR21.  The pain diminished to a mild ache for another 33 hours until it became insignificant by 4:00PM on 09APR21.  07APR21, 1:00PM ? Dry Eyes: Onset of an intermittent feeling of very dry eyes that lasted approximately 1-2 hours at a time and continued over a period of 9 hours until 10PM on 07APR21.  07APR21, 3:30PM - Fatigue: Onset of mild fatigue that steadily increased until bedtime at 10:00PM on 07APR21; and was significantly more pronounced at 1:00AM on 08APR21 (was difficult to stand and walk 20? to closet to obtain a thermometer; could not walk straight and bumped into hallway on left 4-5 times).  Fatigue was rather frightening and severe from 3:00AM to 3:30AM on 08APR21 when I crawled to the bathroom, but could not get off my knees and collapsed on the floor until I could return to bed by crawling on the floor.  Was able to stand again at 7:00AM on 08APR21 and walked (slowly) 30? to a sofa.  Slept from 10PM on 07APR21 to 1:00AM on 08APR21; 4:00-7:30AM on 08APR21; 8:30-10:30AM on 08APR21; 11:00AM to 3:00PM on 08APR21; 7:00PM on 08APR21 to 3:00AM on 09APR21; 3:30AM to 7:30AM on 09APR21; 9:30PM on 09APR21 to 9:15AM on 10APR21; 6:40PM on 10APR21 to 7:00AM on 11APR21.  Ongoing weariness continues as I write this at 11:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Nausea: Onset of continuous nausea that lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes until 08APR21, 8:30AM. Nausea was particularly bad with intermittent dry heaves for the 7.5 hours lasting from 1:00AM to 8:30AM on 08APR21; Nausea then came in waves for 23 more hours until 09Apr21, 7:30AM when it was finally gone.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Headache: Onset of headache that has lasted 4 days (as of 11APR21, 10:30AM). Finally gave in and took one extended release tablet of 650mg Acetaminophen tablet about 25 hours after the vaccination (i.e., took painkiller at 10:30AM on 08APR21).  Took two Ibuprofen at 9:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Chills: Onset of chills that increased to intermittent shivering by bedtime at 10PM on 07APR21. Awoke at 1:00AM on 08APR21 and could not get warm.  Two hours later, at 3:00AM, I felt completely opposite and could not feel cool.  These symptoms gradually subsided and were gone by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Joint Pain and Muscle Aches: Onset of joint pain and muscle aches that occasionally became annoying with twinges of pain. These symptoms subsided by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Dizziness: Onset of mild dizziness that lasted 12 hours until 7:15AM on 08APR21.  08APR21, 1:00AM ? Measured Fever: Decided to measure temperature due to significant chills and shivering and found temperature was 101.0 at 1:00AM on 08APR21.  At 3:00PM on 08APR21, my temperature was 100.2 (this was 4.5 hours after taking one extended release tablet of 650mg acetaminophen).  At 3:00AM on 09APR21, my temperature measured 98.6 degrees and has remained near there ever since.  09APR21, 4:00PM ? Arm Rash: First noticed presence of a rash measuring about 2? x 3? on upper arm near the area that received the injection.

Around 12pm on 4/8 I had severe nerve like pain in my neck, back, chest that was radiating throughout my arms and body. I went to the ER they did an EKG, X-ray, blood test, contrasted CT scan to rule out blood clots. My blood pressure and pulse and respiratory were all high. I was given morphine, toradol and a steroid through IV to control the pain. The pain caused me to feel immobile due to the more I moved the more it hurt. I was discharged after no life threatening issues were found even still with an elevated bp and pulse. The doctor did say he was concerned of the pain radiating but was unable to state from what. I was sent home with morphine pills (which I have no taken any as we are in a large opioid pandemic as well and I am a clinical therapist). I could not sleep when I returned home. I had to sit straight up. I took Tylenol and it relieved the pain slightly. On 4/10 I attempted a car ride to get out of the house. Shortly after leaving my house my face became bright red, I couldn?t breathe well, I felt extremely hot and the pain was no radiating down my legs. I went to the pharmacy that gave me the shot as they have a clinic. My bp was 147/97 with a pulse of 116 and a fever now of 101.4 ( I havent had the fever until this point). They advised me to go back to the ER. Upon arriving to the ER for the second time in two days. Same test were given besides the CT.  I was given toradol by IV and saline again. The pain continues to radiate though my body. I can barely move. Again it is not muscle pain but nerve pain! I can barely move my neck or legs.

At the doctor's office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31.

Information on the patient's concurrent conditions, medical history or concomitant therapy was not reported.      On 02-OCT-2013, the patient received her first shot of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). On 03-DEC-2013, the patient received her second shot of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). It was claimed that as a result of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL), the patient sustained autoimmune disease, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), dysautonomia and other serious injuries. It was reported that quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) and its ingredients caused patient's autoimmune disease and other related injuries and had resulted in her suffering from severe, debilitating, disabling and painful chronic injuries. Prior to receiving her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections, patient was doing well and maintaining overall good health. She had no autoimmune diseases, and no autonomic issues and no orthostasis.   Within one week following her second quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injection, patient began experiencing dizziness and shakiness, headache, and nausea. She also noticed an increased heartbeat and felt faint and unsteady when she stood. Considering these post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) symptoms, and her rapidly declining health, patient's mother did not consent to patient receiving a third shot of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL).  As the months progressed, so did patient's injuries. She was seen by multiple physicians and specialists for her complaints which included: daily seizures; intractable vertigo and nausea exacerbated by double vision; visual floaters; balance difficulties; fatigue; anxiety and panic attacks; convulsions; sleep apnea and sleep disturbances; depression and atypical response to antidepressants; cognitive difficulties; numbness and tingling in her lower extremities; involuntary movements and tics; weakened connective tissue and chronic joint pain; vision and hearing loss; vaginismus and endometriosis.  As a result of her post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) symptoms, patient was unable to engage in normal activities that a teenager would enjoy. She no longer could participate in school and choir events in the same manner she used to prior to her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections, her physical activities declined, she was constantly tired, dizzy, fatigued or in pain. Patient's vision and cognitive abilities declined, she was taken out of school had to complete the majority of her high school classes via homebound and one-on-one tutoring. Patient could no longer physically attend school in a normal fashion due to her deteriorated medical condition.  Studies, including serum samples from June 2018, demonstrated that patient tested positive for the anti-alpha-1 adrenergic antibodies, anti-beta-2 adrenergic antibodies, anti-muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 antibodies, anti-muscarinic cholinergic receptor 3 antibodies, and anti-muscarinic cholinergic receptor 4 antibodies. Patient is at risk for anti-AT1R antibodies and anti-ETAR antibodies.  Based upon her chronic and severe post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) symptoms and adverse events as outlined above and the tests performed by her medical providers, patient had been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to, POTS, sinus tachycardia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), mixed connective tissue disease, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS), pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis, vaginismus, neurogenic bladder, worsened hearing loss, progressive vision loss in both central acuity and peripheral vision, seizures and sleep apnea.  Patient contends that her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) injections caused her to develop serious and debilitating injuries, including but not limited to autonomic, neurological, heterogenous autoimmune disease, POTS, as well as a constellation of adverse symptoms, complications, injuries, and other adverse events, many of which are alleged herein and all of which were caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) or otherwise linked to her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL)-induced autoimmune disorder.  As a proximate result of Company's wrongful acts and omissions and its negligent and fraudulent testing, labeling, manufacturing, marketing and promotion of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL), patient had suffered and continues to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries and associated symptomology and has suffered severe and permanent emotional injuries, including pain and suffering. Patient also had a substantial fear of suffering additional and ongoing harms, including but not limited to now being at an increased risk of cancer and future symptoms and harms associated with her autoimmune disease and other injuries caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL). As a direct and proximate result of her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL)-induced injuries, patient had suffered and continues to suffer economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, and diminished income capacity, and she will continue to incur these losses and expenses in the future.

Her physical activities were drastically limited. It was reported that before Covid-19 pandemic, patient was able to alleviate some of her pain with ketamine infusions, which gave her relief from the burning nerve pain of the CRPS. She was not able to receive the treatment in nearly a year due to the pandemic, and the pain in her bones, nerves, and joints was constant.  The outcome of the events was resported as not recovered/not resolved. The events were considered to be related to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL).

I used a gloved hand and grasped the safety cover at the rim and pulled it in a manner that allowed the needle to come straight out.

Patient did not  do anything that indicated he was aware of what happened, but I told him about it, showed him the needle and the syringe and told him that the full dose had been administered before this happened. Patient said he thought he felt a small splash of liquid on his arm, and possibly also on his forearm.  I called Janssen Pharmaceuticals and spoke to Pharmacist. She said if the patient received at least 50% of the dose then no further action is required. If he received less than 50% of the dose then a full dose should be administered in the alternate arm.  Janssen reference #020954274.  I relayed this info in patient, he said he agreed that he received at least 50% of the dose.

Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don't remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don't know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5'3"" 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it's supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.

In the first week after the vaccine, the pain was quite sharp and severe in my left hip.  Over time the pain spread further down my leg and was a searing ache.  I did not experience leg or joint pain when awake and up and around.  About four days I awoke having what seemed like one of my sleep cycle panic attacks with the exception that I did not experience mental panic, only very rapid heart beat and high blood pressure and arm tingling.  I took alprazolam as prescribed by my physician.  The symptoms were very slow to abate.  I was concerned I was having a stroke or heart attack but decided it was just a panic attack.  By week four following my first vaccine the leg pain had lessened.  After the second vaccine, the entire scenario above reoccured including  hip and leg pain on my left side.  The pain in my joint was not as sharp but it is severe enough to wake me up.  It occurs at about 3:30 am at night and lasts 2-3 hours.  I had a second panic attack with the same description of symptoms (severe rapid heart beat (153) high blood pressure (can provide exact measure - I recall the upper number was 165 and I typically have normal blood pressure).  Took alpralozam and the cardiac synptoms were slow to abate and in fact resurged even after medication.  I continue to have left-side hip and knee join pain and leg pain in my sleep to this day on the same very regular, predictable schedule and the pain continues to be enough to wake me up and make me very uncomfortable, thereby disrupting my sleep every night.

My myalgias and arthralgias were extreme.  Despite ample hydration (3 L of oral rehydration formula from midnight until morning) my kidney output dropped to zero from 1am on 6Feb2021 to 2pm on 6Feb2021 (13 hours).  This started resolving around 2pm.  I did go to the ER around 3pm to have a Basic Metabolic Panel and CK checked.  These results were within normal limits.  The specific gravity on my urine analysis was obviously low due to my hydration of 3L of fluid.  By the time I was discharged from the ER my urine output was in overdrive and my vitals were stable.  My other symptoms resolved over the next 2 days except for fatigue. Was able to work the next week despite lingering low-level fatigue. A week later I went cross-country skiing using the same ski gear I have been using for the past 15 years.  My ski boots extend up to my mid-calves.  During the ski outing my lower legs became extremely sore.  Upon removing my boots at the end of the ski trip, I found that I was completely bruised on both my lower extremities.  This has NEVER happened before.  I went back to the ER for additional bloodwork.  This time a CBC, complete metabolic panel, INR, PT/PTT, CK, ESR, CRP were performed.  All results were within normal limits and I was discharged with stable vitals.  The bruising resolved over the following week.  The low-level fatigue remained. One month later I went skiing again.  This time my lower legs became very sore, but there was no bruising.  The low-level fatigue remained. I do have HSV and use valacyclovir only prn.  During the 2 months after my 2nd vaccine dose, I experienced  prodromal symptoms of an outbreak about 4 times (much more than my usual) and had to take valacyclovir for a few days each time.

Within a week however the pain has settled to my very low back or the top part of my butt on both sides.

I take 4 advil now every mourning just to get to work or out of bed and some days it feels worse then others. I can't bike anymore without intense pain in what I believe is my siactic nerve there at the top of my butt. I'm worried it's going to immobilize me simply because it hurts to get up and walk. I move a lot slower because of the pain and people have noticed because I can't help but walk with a slight limp most the time.

I have never experienced anxiety, depression, or any such symptoms in my life before, nor was I nervous or anxious about having received the vaccine. The onset of the event was sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, without real purpose, hence my conviction that it may have been spurred as a side effect from the vaccination.  I went to Urgent Care Sunday morning, April 11th, the morning after the event. My resting pulse was 97 BPM (normally 52-54) - and my blood pressure much higher than normal - 175/110. The doctor insisted I go home ""and relax"".    I still feel uneasy and shaken from the event.",,,,,,,,,U,04/08/2021,04/10/2021,2,,PUB,,none,none,none,,,2,04/11/2021,,Y,,none

It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I'm a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital.

The case was considered for suspected vaccination failure being time to onset unknown. The case was considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was not reported. Outcome of the event was not reported.  The authors commented ""In this retrospective cohort study of 4742 blood cultures obtained from children in the pediatric ED, we found that vaccination status was not associated with bacteremia. Our cohort is composed of children cared for at a pediatric quaternary care facility. All of the cases of S pneumoniae and Hib bacteremia in this study were isolated from subjects who were fully vaccinated. In this study, 5.0% of blood cultures were contaminated and younger infants were significantly more likely to have contaminant growth, likely owing to the greater number of overall cultures obtained. In a systematic review of children presenting with fever without a source, the rate of contaminant growth exceeded that of pathogenic growth in all subjects. Vaccination against S pneumoniae and H influenza has virtually eliminated these pathogens in children aged 2-36 months. Obtaining blood cultures based on vaccination status may not be routinely indicated unless these specific pathogens are of high clinical suspicion or in populations that may lack herd immunity due to low rates of vaccination. In the age of routine vaccinations against S pneumoniae and Hib, clinicians require further guidance on specifically when blood cultures are indicated in pediatric patients younger than the age of 3 years"".",,,,,Y,,,,U,,,,"Test Name: blood test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:Hib type B bacteremia,Unit:unknown,Normal Low:,Normal High:)",UNK,,PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Premature baby (born at 33-week),,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2021GS,2,04/12/2021,,,,

On 4/8 I also had a fever topping 101.4, fatigue (I slept a lot that day), mental fog, pain at injection site, and all-around body pain.

By 4/12, these symptoms are nearly completely gone.

By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough.

1196521,04/12/2021,NY,47.0,47,,F,,"5 April 2021, at 14:15: Approximately 45 minutes after my initial Moderna vaccine the left side of my face became freezing cold and numb. The progression was instantaneous yet started deep in my inner left ear and around the outside corner of my left eye and instantly moved up to my forehead (crossing the midline), then down the midline of my face encompassing my left eye, the left side of my nose, lips, roof of my mouth, gums, tongue, back over to my left cheek area all the way to my left ear. Simultaneously, I had a surge of metallic-tasing saliva, and I had a tingling vibration (tingling without the pins-and-needles) in both of my hands and on my left shin, just above my ankle to just below my knee. It all happened so fast that I could not talk and verbalize what was happening, I could only hold up my hand in a STOP position. My airway was open and I did not have any respiratory issues. The numbness in my face was about a 9 out of 10. Very numb, very frozen.   We went back to the vaccination site and I was put under observation for an additional 15-20 minutes. The observation was 100% hands-off?no BP, no pulse ox, no temperature. I was released with the advice that if I developed any breathing difficulties that I was ?to go to the local emergency room.?   5 April 2021, at 19:00. The numbness receded to about a 5 out of 10. I did not have any respiratory issues, but was able to start noticing other parts of my body that were numb: the entire roof of my mouth; my teeth/gums from the midline-left; when I swallowed I noticed that my throat had no sensation on the left side and felt ?smooth?; both deep, inner ears ached without the any sharp pain. I had a massive headache and took 400mg of ibuprofen and went to bed.       6 April 2021, 09:00. After waking I got out of bed and noticed that my left leg was weak. I thought it was the position that I had been sleeping in, yet it did not?and still has not?gone away. The numbness in my face was still present and that it had extended down onto my lower lips and chin. Most of the left side of my face felt like heavy Silly Puddy, it felt swollen and stiff. The outside corner of my left eye, the left side of my nose, forehead creases and ear were stationary and not moving. My blinking felt off, but didn?t look off. I could now tell that the entire left side of my body was markedly weaker than my right side, my balance was off. I could not feel sensation in my chest/lung cavity as I inhaled and exhaled like I could on my right side. I did not have any airway or breathing difficulties. I rested and hydrated.   6 April 2021, 20:00. A rash of itching, burning hives erupted onto my lower left jaw from just outside my lip line and spread along the curve of my lower jaw bone to my hairline. By 22:00 the itch and burning had subsided, but I could feel that it was still there.   7 April 2021, 02:30. I woke up with excruciating, stabbing ear pain in my right inner ear. I took ibuprofen and tried to fall back to sleep.   7 April 2021, 09:00. My face felt increasingly swollen and stiff and the numb/tingling/vibration sensation in my lower left leg began to spread to my inner leg, around to my calf, up and over my knee to my upper thigh; my leg became so weak that it buckled. We spoke to a nurse advice line and she recommended going to the emergency room.   7 April 2021, 15:00.  Dr. saw me. I was given to CT Scan to rule out stroke and an ultrasound to rule out blood clot. I was given the diagnosis of Bell?s Palsy and was put on antiviral medication; I declined the steroids because they increase my allergic response reactions.  11 April 2021, 18:00. My face started to swell up over my left eye, left cheek, left ear and over to my right cheek. It did not restrict my airway. I went to bed.   12 April 2021, 17:30. My face?midline to left?is still numb; the left side of my body?especially my left leg?is still markedly weaker than my right; I get winded easily; I tire easily; my mouth still tastes metallic; I still have inner earaches on both sides; my eyes are extremely dry.

The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.

When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.
