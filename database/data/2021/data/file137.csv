Brief periods of being aware of the tightness followed by long intervals without sensation. Never painful, never distressing, just mildly there on and off.  After 24 hours sensation had not gone away. Decided to go to ER (~48 hours after the shot)  out of concern for heart. At the ER, EKG was normal, traponin levels were normal (tested it twice), chest x-ray was normal, CT with contrast showed no sign of a clot.  I did not have swelling in my legs, nor any difficulty breathing, so the doctor ruled out myocarditis.  I left ER without an explanation and with instructions to follow-up with a cardiologist.  I waited a few more days to see if the sensation would go away. It didn?t. During this time, the pattern was pretty much the same as before, but some new sensations  emerged.  A few times, I had a sharp ?lightning bolt? that lasted only a second but was like a zap.    Once it became clear that the problem was ongoing, I made an appointment with a cardiologist.  I had a tele-health appointment with her on Friday, 11/19. She believes that the shot induced mild inflammation.  She told me to take ibuprofen and within a day or so the symptoms (mostly) subsided.

Severe COVID pneumonia with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. 2. Community-acquired pneumonia. 3. Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure. 4. Persistent atrial fibrillation. 5. History of repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm. 6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  HOSPITAL COURSE An 84-year-old gentleman presented with 5 days of cough.  See H and P for full details.  He was hypoxic and required 2 L of oxygen.  He was started on Decadron and remdesivir.  Chest x-ray showed bibasilar interstitial thickening and airspace opacities.  Procalcitonin elevated which raised the suspicion for bacterial pneumonia on top of COVID.  The patient had rather rapid resolution of his hypoxia and by the third day of admission, was on room air.  On that day, however, he had increased crackles.  He received 40 mg IV Lasix.  On the fourth hospital day, crackles were essentially resolved.  He remained on room air.  He felt that he was stable for discharge.  He received 4 days remdesivir and 4 days Decadron.  We did not feel that the fifth day of remdesivir was necessary.  He will, however, complete another 6 days of Decadron at discharge.

No swelling was seen. No tenderness of throat. Patient mentioned it is still scratchy but does not feel restrictive anymore. At 10:05 AM, O2 sensor (99%) and HR (80%) were consistent with not having an anaphylactic shock, however due to throat scratchiness. Recommended to give 50 mg diphenhydramine and 20 mg famotidine (verbal order from ED doctor in  Regional hospital). Patient was able to swallow pills without issues. Recommended to monitor for 30 minutes. At 10:40 AM, Patient was doing well. Throat scratch was a little better. HR and O2 sensor were 80 and 99%, respectively. Advised the patient to go home and monitor himself. Give us a call if condition gets worse. Counseled that he could be drowsy and someone should take him home.   Called patient at home at 11:50 Am and he was doing really well breathing fine. Will call again before evening shift. Recommended to go to emergency department if condition gets worse.

Also had mild fatigue and a brief, unusual nerve pain that went down left leg to foot (which went away completely after it occurred). However, after 10-12 days of receiving the 1st dose of Shingrix, the patient started to develop a burning pain in right knee area.  This burning pain occurred when the patient bent knee and touched the floor, leaning on knee. This pain had continued, remains pronounced, and did not go away.  It feels like the pain was happening just beneath the skin of the knees.  Both knees appear to be affected, but it was worse on his right knee.  It feels like it was related to the skin above the knee, as the knee joint itself does not hurt.  About 24 to 36 hours after the Shingrix injection he noticed a tingling sensation that went all the way down his left leg to his foot and then went away in a few minutes.  About 5 days ago from the date of reporting on 10th November 2021 both his elbows and both knees were sensitive. The patient had a burning sensation in his right knee if he rubs the right knee it was fine, but if he touches it with a piece of fabric it burns and feel inflamed, could not kneel his right knee on the ground because of the painful burning sensation. It was much more pronounced on the right knee. The reporter asked was this burning knee pain related to the Shingrix vaccine and if so, when should he expect it to go away.  The patient had taken Motrin and Naprosyn to take the edge off his right knee.

The patient would appreciate receiving any documentation, research or information if GlaxoSmithKline have on this possible side effect.

1892710,11/23/2021,MD,,,,F,,"ELEVATED TROPONIN; DIZZINESS; This 70-year-old, White, female subject (US0070109) was participating in ""A Phase 2/3 Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of mRNA Vaccine Boosters for SARS-CoV-2 Variants (mRNA-1273-P205)"" and experienced dizziness and elevated troponin.   The subject's medical history, as provided by the investigator, included complete hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, suspected ovarian cancer, benign abdominal mass, excision benign abdominal mass, sinus bradycardia, chronic diarrhea, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type II diabetes, sensory diabetic neuropathy of bilateral feet, sulfa drugs allergy, erythromycin allergy, mild venous insufficiency, postmenopausal, smoker, minocycline allergy, and tetracycline allergy. Concomitant medications reported included potassium chloride, hydralazine, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, pregabalin, tramadol, metformin hydrochloride/sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate, acetylsalicylic acid/caffeine/paracetamol, calcium chloride/potassium chloride/sodium lactate, and magnesium.  The subject previously experienced the serious adverse event of symptomatic bradycardia (MOD-2021-258186) while participating in this study.   On 02 Jul 2021, approximately 29 days prior to the onset of the events, the subject received the single booster shot dose of mRNA-1273.211 intramuscularly, 100 micrograms (one-time dose) in the left arm in Part A of the study for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30 Jul 2021, the subject experienced dizziness and elevated troponin. Subject presented to the emergency department with dizziness, diaphoresis, and nausea that morning. She denied chest pain. She reported feeling off balance. Two weeks ago, she woke up with similar symptoms but more severe. At that time, she went to the hospital and was found to be bradycardic (heart rate 32-34). She was referred to outpatient cardiology but has not followed up. The subject reported she did not drink a lot of the water the day before and that dehydration usually causes these types of symptoms. Vitals revealed pulse was 46-58 beats per minute (bpm). She was admitted because of sinus bradycardia. She was given intravenous fluids and heart rate went back to normal. Subject also endorsed a positive stress test about 20 years ago but never followed up with further evaluation. Physical exam of cardiovascular revealed regular rate. Regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Distal pulses were 2+ and symmetric. Labs revealed cardiac enzymes were elevated upon initial admission; troponin was 0.01 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL). The subject had a negative SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab. Chest x-ray revealed normal heart size. No infiltrates were seen. Normal appearance to the pulmonary vasculature. No pleural effusion was apparent. No acute bony abnormality seen. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and low voltage QRS. No significant change when compared to ECG of 23 Jun 2006. Treatment included intravenous calcium chloride/ potassium chloride/ sodium lactate for dizziness and oral acetylsalicylic acid and subcutaneous enoxaparin for elevated cardiac enzymes.  On 31 Jul 2021, the subject's troponin was <0.01 ng/mL, and she remained hospitalized for further evaluation. Computerized tomogram of head and brain was normal. ECG showed sinus bradycardia and low voltage QRS. No significant change when compared to ECG from previous day. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed left ventricular estimated ejection fraction 70%. Left ventricular size was normal. Borderline concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. No regional wall motion abnormalities. Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Benign diastolic inflow patter. No significant valve pathology. Doppler suggested normal pulmonary artery pressures.   On 01 Aug 2021, repeat troponin was within normal limits at <0.01 ng/mL. Vitals include heart rate of 52 bpm. Physical exam of cardiovascular revealed S1 and S2 normal, bradycardic no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The subject was hemodynamically stable and cardiology cleared the subject. She was discharged from the hospital and advised to follow-up with cardiology soon after discharge for cardiac monitor placement.   On 02 Aug 2021, repeat troponin was within normal limits. Per the investigator, there was no underlying cause known to date. Dizziness can be in the setting of bradycardia and dehydration. Subject had risk factors, hypertension, and diabetes.   The subject received the single booster shot dose of study drug prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The event, dizziness, was reported as resolved on 30 Jul 2021. The event, elevated troponin, was reported as resolved on 31 Jul 2021.   The investigator assessed the events, dizziness and elevated troponin, as not related to the study drug.  Follow-up received on 11 Aug 2021 included updated event term to dizziness (previously reported symptomatic bradycardia), medical history, treatment, concomitant medication details, additional AESI of elevated cardiac enzyme, and confirmation of discharge date.  Follow-up received on 14 Sep 2021 included updated event term (previously elevated cardiac enzyme), updated severity for event elevated troponin (previously mild), concomitant medications, COVID-19 test results, troponin results, medical history, and information that elevated troponin is not an AESI.  Follow-up received on 21 Sep 2021 and 22 Sep 2021 included updated event term to elevated cardiac enzymes (previous elevated troponin) and discharge summary with additional medical history, diagnostic tests, laboratory results, symptoms, and other clinical details of hospitalization.   Follow-up received on 04 Oct 2021 included updated event term (previously elevated cardiac enzymes) and confirmation of study drug arm.  Follow-up received on 15 Oct 2021 included no new information.  Follow-up received on 29 Oct 2021 included an update to the causality of the study drug for event of elevated troponin (previously reported as related) and downgrade to serious adverse event.  Follow-up received on 08 Nov 2021 included confirmation of study drug.  On 28 Sep 2021, the safety database was searched for events similar to Myocardial necrosis marker increased using the following search criteria: PT: Myocardial necrosis marker increased  As of 28 Sep 2021, under IND 019745 for mRNA-1273.211, two similar events were retrieved, including the current index case.  None of these cases reporting the following event were previously submitted as IND Safety Reports: Myocardial necrosis marker increased.  One case was a non-IND Safety Report (expected and related or unexpected and unrelated or expected and unrelated to the IMP) reporting the following event: Myocardial necrosis marker increased (1) MCN# MOD-2021-199200.  Case MOD-2021-199200: Unexpected events of elevated cardiac enzymes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was experienced by a 68 year old male subject with medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, supraventricular tachycardia, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The events occurred 9 months 10 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273.211 vaccine and 8 months 13 days after the last dose. The events were considered unrelated to the study medication in agreement with the Investigator's assessment, noting the multiple comorbidities may remain as risk factors.  Based on review of available data, the Sponsor does not believe a cause and effect relationship has been established between administration of mRNA-1273 study vaccine and the occurrence of dizziness.  After review of the clinical details and investigator comments pertaining to this adverse event, and based upon experience to date, the Sponsor does not believe that changes to the conduct of this clinical trial are warranted. The Company will continue to monitor these and other serious adverse events reported in association with the IMP and will communicate any relevant changes to the protocol, Informed Consent Form, Investigator's Brochure, and/or Core Safety Information.; Reporter's Comments: This case concerns a 70-year-old, White, female subject with a medical history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, type II diabetes, sensory diabetic neuropathy, complete hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, suspected ovarian cancer, benign abdominal mass, excision benign abdominal mass, sinus bradycardia and chronic diarrhea who experienced dizziness and elevated troponin. The events happened 29 days after receiving single booster shot dose of mRNA-1273.211, and both events resolved within two days. The event elevated troponin was initially assessed as related to mRNA-1273.211 by the sponsor and the investigator and finally it was reassessed as not related to IP in agreement with the Investigator. The event dizziness was assessed as unrelated to mRNA-1273.211 in agreement with the Investigator. The event dizziness might be explained by the subject's medical history of sinus bradycardia and type II diabetes.",,,,,Y,3,,,Y,07/02/2021,07/30/2021,28,"Test Name: Stress test; Test Result: Positive  ; Result Unstructured Data: Positive; Test Date: 20210730; Test Name: Chest x-ray; Result Unstructured Data: revealed normal heart size.

It develops in utero. My daughter was forced to get Pfizer shot and developed pericarditis within 24 hours from the second dose a shot, a shot, I'm not picking on you guys. My son also needs it for his job, but he has endocarditis/myocarditis. His tricuspid and pulmonic valve are regurging. I know the Johnson and Johnson created clot problems. If he develops pericarditis with his family and valvular history, it's just not necessary, is this something that he could get an exemption for? Caller states that she is calling in regards to the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Her daughter got it, and got pericarditis. Her daughter is 24 years old. The reason she is calling is because she has a son that is 23 years old. Caller interrupts herself, in order to elaborate further saying that her father has abdominal aortic aneurysm disease. Caller states that she herself had an Aortic dissection, since she was informed this disease is hereditary, caller got a genetic test done for it, caller states that she herself did have the genetic test abnormality in Notch 1 and Mat 2A. When she got her results she was advised to have the children get tested, since this has to do with the Aorta, it's an Aortic type of gene in which there is a Utero mutation. Her son has completed the testing and got an echocardiogram, in which the results that came back showed a couple regurgitation sites on 2 valves. Caller states that her Daughter has not done the tests, she works in a hospital and was forced to get shot, and then got pericarditis. Caller asks does this genetic mutation qualify for her son to not get the shots. Caller states that she has got the inserts and read everything on Adverse events, like myocarditis and endocarditis which her son has and doesn't believe it is safe for him to get the shot. Caller states that she can do the safety report at another time, she is willing to provide information for the survey. At the moment she is calling for her question. Caller declines safety report at this time and request to do it later. Caller states that she is a Physician Assistant. Caller confirms that her son has not received any covid vaccine, but she knows that they are going to require it pretty soon. Caller states that her daughter still has chest pain, the only good thing is that she works with cardiologist at work. Caller would like to know if there are any cardiac contraindications for the Vaccine. Outcome of event chest pain was not recovered, of Pericarditis was unknown.   The lot number for the vaccine, [BNT162B2], was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender's Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events pericarditis and chest pain and the suspect drug Comirnaty cannot be excluded.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.   LITERATURE REFERENCE: ""A case of Gross hematuria and IgA nephropathy flare-up following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Kidney Int Rep.    The patient's past medical history included Proteinuria. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Kidney dysfunction.   On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form.

At the time of the report, IGA NEPHROPATHY (IgA nephropathy flare-up) and HAEMATURIA (Gross hematuria) outcome was unknown and PROTEINURIA (proteinuria) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Biopsy kidney: positive (Positive) Owing to persistent kidney dysfunction, 3 months after second vaccine dose, patient 3 underwent a kidney biopsy, showing an active and chronic IgA nephropathy with 13% active crescents. On an unknown date, Blood creatinine: 1.17 Baseline value was 1.17, 1.54 At Presentation value was 1.54 and 1.24 Follow-up 1 month post second dose was -1.24. On an unknown date, Blood urine: 11 to 25 Baseline value was 11 to 25, greater than  50 At Presentation value was greater than  50 and 11 to 25 Follow-up 1 month post second dose was 11 to 25. On an unknown date, Urine protein/creatinine ratio: 2.40 Baseline value was 2.40, 3.56 At Presentation value was 3.56 and 2.20 Follow-up 1 month post second dose was 2.20.

No concomitant information were reported.  In this case, patients 3  with chronic kidney disease and mild proteinuria at baseline, who developed not only gross hematuria but also significant proteinuria and kidney function decline. As his kidney function and proteinuria showed improvement, patient 3 declined immunosuppressive therapy and was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and close follow-up. Follow-up 1 mo post second dose hematuria and proteinuria returned to baseline; Serum creatinine (SCr) improving but above baseline.  Company Comment: This case concerns a 50 year-old, male patient with a history of Hypertension, Renal impairment and Proteinuria, who experienced the serious unexpected event of IgA nephropathy.

This lasted for 4 days followed by 100-degree fever for another day and extreme tiredness for several weeks. In light of this reaction, she was hesitant to obtain a booster shot without discussing this with a professional medical adviser. Her concern was that this was not a typical response and that she was experiencing a hyperimmune or autoimmune response. Also, Guillain-Barre syndrome crossed her mind. At that time, she did not consider that the product was defective, but rather that something in her immune system might be amiss. On 27Sep2021, while at a well-care visit, she discussed this reaction with her physician. She recommended that perhaps she could delay taking the booster if she checked her antibody titers. She was not comfortable with putting off the inevitable, taking a booster, since she was over 65 years old. The following day, she called the facility to obtain reassurance that her reaction was normal and it would be safe to make an appointment for a booster shot. She spoke to (privacy) in the medical division. She advised her to speak to her physician which she had already done and she read off a list of common reactions. She did not experience a rash, hives, low grade fever, or any other anaphylaxis event.

Medical history included thyroid, anxiety, and broken her foot last year, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Family history included: whole family took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation.

No prior vaccination within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. On an unknown date in Jun2021, the patient went from being good to having both kidneys only functioning at 55%/ the caller has dropped from 65% functioning of both kidneys down to 55% functioning of kidneys. The patient was almost 158 pounds to 159 pounds and now she is down to 134 pounds, on an unspecified date. As reported clinical course: She had Pfizer shots in Mar2021 and Apr2021 and when she got her blood work done in Jun2021, 6 months after the blood work in Jan2021, it came back bad for her kidneys. She had the blood work done a 2nd time recently and it came back bad again and now she is seeing a kidney specialist for this. She went from being good to having both kidneys only functioning at 55% and the vaccine is the only thing that is different, it was the only thing that she had done different this year than what she normally does which was her blood work for her Synthroid. Last year, at the end of the year, she was almost 158 pounds to 159 pounds and now she was down to 134 pounds. That was what started this whole thing, her weight loss. She didn't think about it being related to the vaccine until last night because she has been dissecting this for the last week and half and thinking of what she has done differently in the last year. She has been at 65% for her kidney function up until after she had the vaccine and, now she is at 55%. She was at 65% her whole life, which is high and it's good, but after she had the vaccine and went and got her 6 months review of her bloodwork, because she goes every 6 months, it had went to 55%. So, it dropped from 65% to 55% in both kidneys in Jun2021 and then it had happened again. Caller confirmed that the drop was noticed in Jun2021 and then she had her blood tested again and it came back again at 55%. When it had came back at that level again her doctor had sent her to the kidney specialist who said that it was at 55% the last two times and all the previous stuff that was sent to him was good until Jan2021. Caller clarified and confirmed that her blood work was good in Jan2021 and then in Jun2021 is when it fell from 65% to 55% and the only thing that was done different in her whole life was the Pfizer COVID vaccines that she had in Mar2021 and Apr2021. Patient can't remember when redraw was for the bloodwork that showed the results of 55% kidney functioning again. She stated, it may have been around her birthday, but actually it was probably in Aug2021 or maybe Sep2021, she doesn't know when but probably Sep2021. Patient reported, she didn't know it was that low until she went to the specialist. Her doctor, which is her GP (documented as provided by caller) didn't know the percentage but he knew that it had gone down a lot and so he had sent the caller to the specialist and said that he didn't like the way it was looking. At that time the caller thought that only 1 kidney was affected, she didn't know how bad it was and that it was with both. She had no pain or no blood in her urine, she had none of that. But she was losing weight like crazy. She has lost another 5 pounds in the last 4 days. She is losing pounds like crazy which is probably good for most people but not for her at her age and with something else going wrong, it was not good. Inquired for when the weight change was noticed, and she said that she had broken her foot last year. When she was going to the gym, she was only doing little stuff and once she got better, she was able to do some jogging at the gym and did more cardio. She was going regularly, and she wasn't dropping lots of weight she would just drop a pound here and there. Since she works 2 jobs with a night job she is going less, she is only going 2 days a week and she was going 5 days a week before. But now she is dropping weight faster than she was before. She was wearing a 36 waist and now she has put enough holes in them to be a 32 and had added 2 more holes below the 32. Her lowest waist was a 29 when she was in high school, and she is heading back that direction. She has dropped a lot, but she really noticed it because she has to put a belt on for her pants and everything is baggy. Her face had sunken in, and she feels okay, she feels alright, and she has no pain or anything, but she thought something like this was happened because she has gotten older or maybe she is shrinking, she doesn't know. Patient reported that, vaccination was very early in the morning and had to be no later than 9:00 AM for both doses. Caller had to follow up with her doctor and a kidney specialist, but she has not had to have a hospital stay as of yet. She hasn't seen the test results since they just took the sonogram, and she did additional bloodwork today. She won't see the specialist until 06Dec2021 when that comes back. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: 55% kidney functioning on an unspecified date, blood test: 65% kidney functioning in Jan2021, blood test: 55% kidney functioning in Jun2021, weight: she is down to 134 pounds on an unspecified date in 2021, and sonogram: unknown result on an unspecified date.

On an unspecified date the patient experienced bladder infection. Additional Context: This consumer reported having been administered her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 06Mar2021. She has a bladder infection which she thinks she probably already had when she got the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She is taking antibiotic Cephalexin also known as Keflex for the bladder infection. She called to ask if it is ok to take the Cephalexin also known as Keflex or will it interfere with the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she is scheduled to be administered on 27Mar2021. Bladder infection: Caller initially reported on call that she has an IUD and is taking Keflex to get rid of the bacteria. Clarified with caller what IUD stood for, such as intrauterine device, caller reported no, not intrauterine device, what she meant to say was bladder infection; and clarified that name of antibiotic from pharmacy bottle of product itself as Cephalexin also known as Keflex, Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, product dispensed in pharmacy vial. Dose is 1-500mg capsule twice daily for 10 days. She has been taking for 3 days at time of this report. She probably already had the bladder infection when she got the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Bladder infection is not unusual for her because she has had a stent between her kidney and bladder for 7 years now; and every 3 months since then she has the stent removed and replaced-she has had the stent removed and replaced 32 times so far. She is prone to bladder and urinary tract infections because of having the stent for years and having the stent removed and replaced every 3 months. Anyone who has a stent for a long period is prone to infection. She has taken antibiotics several times as needed and the antibiotics have never bothered anything. Sometimes she has an infection, sometimes she does not. Her provider is Dr. Name at (Withheld). This time he recommended 3 days of antibiotic therapy, then changed it to 10 days because she has been on antibiotics for so many years that it takes more sometimes to get the infection down.

I could not find guidance in the FDA EUA document, but the CDC interim clinical considerations guidance does address (last updated 11/19/21) and now seems to recommend more clearly to repeat the dose immediately for lower than authorized dose administered e.g. leaked out:  Lower-than-authorized dose volume administered of the correct formulation (e.g., leaked out, equipment failure, recipient pulled away): Repeat dose immediately (no minimum interval). See: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. Based on this, spoke to family, reviewed the limited data available from the phase 1 portion of the Pfizer trial, both 10 and 20 mcg doses were overall well tolerated, though high fever did develop in one child after dose 2 of the 20 mcg dose, lasting 3 days. Since this patient has both an underlying urea cycle defect and periodic fever syndrome, risk of fever bears consideration due to a higher predisposition as well as potential risk of metabolic sequelae arising from fever- so the discussion mostly focused around this increased risk of fever/ reactogenicity. Parents had a chance to talk to his geneticist and discuss amongst themselves, weighed risks vs benefits, felt they could likely manage a fever if it developed by working closely with his genetics team and they ultimately desired to ensure optimal protection by vaccination. He returned to the clinic, and was re-dosed without event. We have not had any other reports of this. The nurse is a seasoned vaccinator so I would trust her vaccination method.

We immediately call 911 and the floor manager and I rush over to her and place her on her side and call her name to elicit a response.  She is responsive within about 15 seconds of calling her name.  She begins to talk normally while remaining on the floor with me on the floor beside her. I asked if she had ever had a reaction like this to a vaccine to which she said no but she has had fainting episodes in the past. A few minutes go by and she has called her father to come pick her up and shes seated in a chair.  The paramedics arrived and discussed with Patient her medical history, took vitals, and asked if she would like to go to the hospital.  Patient said no and I confirmed that her father would come to pick her up from the pharmacy.

Patient was actually enrolled in hospice recently to try to achieve better pain control for leg ulcers, despite life expectancy being >6 months. He had been started on neurontin and hydromorphine, then the narcotic was changed to moprhine.  Patient has CKD. In the ED he was noted to be COVID+ but on RA.  He was admitted for further care.     Neurontin and narcotics were held and patient's mental status improved. Palliative care was consulted and began oxycodone for pain control. This was titrated up.  Initially patient remained on RA and was symptoms free with the covid19 infection. Repeat CXR was consistent with multifocal PNA and PCR confirmed covid +. Was offered monoclonal AB treatment but declined. On 11/14 patient began declining again with AKI and hypotension and worsening AMS. Lactic acid was normal, WBC 11.  CXR 11/14 showed new medial rt lung base opacities concerning for aspiration/PNA.  Unchanged lt opacities.  Blood cultures sent and zosyn given while ruling out superimposed bacterial infection. Given worsening renal function, despite patient not having had received narcotics in the past 12 hours, narcan was given with good response.  Narcotics held.  Patient was placed on IVFs and bolused. Starting on 11/14 patient began to have an O2 requirement and was started on Decadron. After initial narcan patient then had recurrent hypotension and sedation.  2nd narcan given with some response.  At this point discussion was had with daughter regarding goals of care. As patient was at the beginning of his covid course, which was likely to continue to worsen, having AKI, AMS, and then bleeding and severe pain from his chronic LE venous ulcers, We made the decision to pursue comfort care.  All aggressive interventions were discontinued and patient was started on comfort medications.  Hospice were consulted.

She had pitting edema and signs of fluid overload on CXR and was diagnosed with COVID on arrival.  She is on 5 L oxygen at baseline and was started on high-flow nasal cannula and initially admitted to hospitalist service.    She was diuresed aggressively. She was started on steroids; did not qualify for Remdesivir due to kidney function.Her oxygen requirements continued to increase and she was transitioned to 100% high-flow nasal cannula with non-rebreather mask. Overnight on 11/11, she desated into low 80s and was placed on BIPAP and transferred to ICU service due to concern for impending intubation.    Her respiratory status declined and was intubated on 11/13.  We had multiple conversations about her likely poor prognosis considering her baseline respiratory status, and patient elected to proceed with intubation at that time.  She was sedated and paralyzed, and she subsequent required initiation of norepinephrine. Her respiratory status continued to worsen and we began proning on 11/14. She responded to proning and was continued on a 20:4 proning schedule.   Palliative care was consulted on 11/15 after family expressed concern about patient's grim prognosis and likelihood of tracheostomy and long-term care even if she survived this illness.

The  port reservoir overlies the right pectus musculature.  Pulmonary arteries: Bolus timing is insufficient for definitive exclusion of  small peripheral pulmonary emboli. Within these confines no definite pulmonary  embolism appreciated.  Aorta: Moderate atherosclerotic disease of the aorta without dissection or  aneurysm. There is a common origin of the brachiocephalic and left common  carotid arteries resulting in a 2 vessel aortic arch morphology. Lungs: No dominant pulmonary mass or discrete airspace consolidation. Dependent  atelectasis and areas of pulmonary scarring are appreciated. Suspected subtle  developing peribronchial nodular opacities and mild bronchial wall thickening  in the right upper lobe and left lung base. Although this could reflect post  treatment changes, in the acute setting developing multifocal bronchiolitis  should be considered. Consider short interval follow-up imaging in 3 months to  confirm resolution.  Pleural spaces: Unremarkable. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion.  Heart:  Heart size is stable.  However there is a trace pericardial effusion.   Lymph nodes: No enlarged lymph nodes.  Previous left axillary lymph node  dissection.

Vaccine reaction, initial encounter      Discharge Instructions    As we discussed, I do think that this is a localized reaction and immune response to the vaccines that you received on Wednesday.  This does appear to be resolving.  I have outlined the area of inflammation today please look at this once per day.  If you have redness that is spreading outside the marked area especially if you have any red streaking running up or down your arm, or if your symptoms worsen again such you have return of fevers body aches, chills etc. this may indicate a developing infection and antibiotics may be needed.   You may take acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen if needed.  I do recommend trying to keep your arm elevated at least at heart level when at rest.   Please advise your primary care provider of the reaction.     Differential diagnosis considered include local reaction to vaccine, cellulitis.   Patient notes that he was experiencing symptoms of body aches, malaise fatigue and fever the symptoms have all resolved.  He states initially he did not notice the redness and first noticed this yesterday.  He states that it did seem to be more swollen yesterday but has improved today.   Patient does have an erythematous area with well-defined edges, this area is warm to palpation not hot and swelling is very mild at this point.  As patient describes symptoms of improvement I do think that this is a local immune response to either the shingles vaccine or the pneumonia vaccine both of which she received in the same arm.   At this time I do not think that this is a cellulitis and did not recommend for antibiotics.  The area was outlined with date and time.  Patient is to monitor to the area and return if he has worsening redness including red streaked or worsening symptoms such as fevers, chills or body aches returning.   I did recommend that he contact his primary care provider and advised them of the reaction.  Aftercare follow-up and return precautions reviewed he verbalized understanding is agree with this plan.

Ultimately, he became  s/p pigtail catheter placement by IR x2 with complication of exudative right  sided pleural effusion and persistent volume loss on right side with right sided  tracheal deviation. His previous CT Chest on 10/18 and 10/16 showed  consolidative opacity in RML and RUL likely related to inflammation/fibrosis  which is causing volume loss. Patient is currently now on Eliquis 5mg BID. His  CT scan on 10/23 showed right mediastinal shift, suggestive of  inflammmation/fibrosis and blebs on right lung possibly suggestive of right lung  volume loss, and extensive chest wall emphysema in left lung.

Patient was placed on  NRB 15Lm ultimately satting at 97% on pulse ox. Chest x-ray at admission showed  small bilateral pleural effusions and extensive bilateral lung opacities, right  greater than left, increased since prior comparison study. CT thorax showed  enlarging, large right pleural effusion with new small left pleural effusion;  new multifocal septal thickening with groundglass opacity of both lung, highly  concerning for multifocal pneumonia, new fat stranding about the pancreas,  incompletely visualized concerning for pancreatitis. Patient noted to have a  heart rate initially 150 range; EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Patient  subsequently improved with IV fluids. However, given recent complex hx and  tenuous nature of his oxygenation after multiple attempts to deescalate his  oxygen in ED from NRB to Oxymask (patient will sat down to high 80s), patient  was admitted to ICU for stabilization and management.""",,,,,Y,55,,,N,01/21/2021,10/06/2021,258,,PVT,,Active Outpatient Medications                          Status ========================================================================= 1)   ALLOPURINOL 100MG TAB TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY   ACTIVE        DAY FOR GOUT PREVENTION 2)   B,,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Pterygium, Unsp Dominant drusen Cortical, Senile Age-related cataract of left eye Benign essential hypertension History of male erectile disorder Hemorrhoids Diverticulosis History of colonoscopy Benign prostatic hyperplasia Hyperlipidemia Tinnitus Serum creatinine abnormal Glaucoma Deficiency of vitamin D3 Impaired glucose tolerance Anemia Pulmonary emphysema Osteoarthritis Meibomian gland dysfunction Bilateral pseudophakia Diseases of mitral and aortic valves Chronic kidney disease stage 3",,,2,11/23/2021,,,,shellfish

At baseline patient could ambulate independently in her assisted living room.  Within days, she was no longer able to do so, her swelling worsened, and her oral intake declined.  This time period was complicated by an elevated potassium that improved with oral hydration and it was rechecked and improved, but her decline continued.  She was treated for a UTI from a gathered urine sample starting 9/7/21, but there is uncertainty to the extent it was either responsible or contributing to her declining status.  Patient was carried to the office on 9/16/21.  She was found to have an oxygen saturation of 79-81% on room air, she was too weak to hold her head up, and her swelling had increased.  EMS was recommended for transport to the hospital and with some convincing with her son's assistance, she finally agreed.  Patient was transferred from the rural hospital to a tertiary center in city.  She became severely oliguric.  She was given IV furosemide that was not very effective.  Patient was not only volume overloaded but also hypotensive requiring ionotropic treatment.

There is osteoarthritis within the right glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint.  9/8/2021 MRI Cervical Spine  IMPRESSION:  1.  Mildly limited study due to patient motion.  2.  Multilevel degenerative changes, as detailed above.  3.  Disc bulge and hypertrophic changes greater on the left side with mild to moderate left foraminal narrowing at C5-6.  4.  Disc bulge and hypertrophic changes greater on the left side with moderate to severe left foraminal narrowing at C6-7 level.   10/5/2021 EMG  IMPRESSIONS:  1.  The above electrodiagnostic study reveals evidence of a right severe, axonal brachial plexopathy-- affecting the lower trunk/medial cord-- likely at level of clavicle and distal. Wife reports that there was redness and fullness near Erb's point on the right shortly after the fall. A. Cervical radiculopathy not likely, due to loss of all tested sensory responses. B. Normal serratus anterior and paraspinal muscle exams makes spinal nerve/ proximal trunk/ramus injuries less likely. C. Would expect normal sensory evoked responses if lower cervical avulsion was present.  10/6/2021 Ultrasound  The pectoralis muscle on the right is hyperechoic, suggestive of mild atrophy. No signs of supraclavicular or infraclavicular nerve or plexus enlargement, or hypoechoic nerves. No masses or cysts are noted, no abnormal fluid collections. The axillary area is evaluated-- the median, ulnar, radial, and MC nerves appear normal for echoarchitecture. No signs of arm or forearm atrophy or edema. Assessment: 1. No signs of brachial plexus enlargement, or hypoechogenic features in supraclavicular and infraclavicular regions.  10/7/2021 MRI of Humerus  10/28/2021 MRI of Elbow IMPRESSION: 1. Enlarged and edematous ulnar nerve with foci of fluid signal likely represent neuropathy related to history of trauma. 2. Partial tear of the common extensor tendon with heterotopic ossification, favored to represent remote injury. 3. Full-thickness tear of the radial collateral ligament. 4. Common flexor tendinosis with low-grade partial tearing. 5.

By 7pm on 12/11/2020 my shoulder was in substantial pain? in an area towards the front of my shoulder, not the top/side where the guy at the pharmacy gave me the shot. I had my entire arm exposed during the shot (had a black long sleeve tee on and just pulled my whole arm out to make sure it was all exposed) and I found it odd that he was standing while I was sitting. Also, I said I wanted the shot in my left arm on my paperwork, but he administered the shot in my right arm. When he cleaned off the spot with alcohol to prep, he basically wiped a spot near my shoulder bone, at the top of my shoulder. I thought maybe he was just distracted and would make sure he sat down and confirmed the spot before injecting me. But he stood while administering my shot and injected really high on my arm in the same spot he cleaned, nearly at my bone. I?m 5?2?  and weigh about 100lbs and did not see the needle he used, but i assumed he would know what to use based on my size. I felt the prick of the needle and also some pretty unusual pressure when he was injecting me, and remember his hand was shaking pretty bad and he kept talking about the COVID vaccine while the needle was in my arm (which felt like a lot longer than usual). I didn?t have to sign anything and went on my way. Called my husband on the way home and said my injection didn?t feel right. I went to bed and woke up to excruciating pain toward the front of my shoulder, and I broke out in cold sweat due to the pain. I tried to move my arm to help with the stiffness, but it?s very painful. That next morning we both looked under the bandage at the injection spot and were surprised to see it Is nearly at the top of my shoulder. My pain worsened quickly. I could raise my arms or pick up my the. 9month old son.  It very scary and also painful. I had no shoulder issues before. I?m physically active and healthy.

1894934,11/23/2021,NV,36.0,36,,F,,"Initially created November 18, 2021 *Updated 11/23/2021  On May 15, 2021, I received the one-dose Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccination.   That day, I started my period, which I was expecting. After about 4 days, the bleeding started to become very heavy, and I expelled blood clots that were approximately the size of a racquetball. I have not experienced blood clots like this since I gave birth to my children. I have never experienced extremely heavy bleeding or clotting during my regular periods, which typically are spaced apart every 2-3 months. I contacted my OBGYN, Dr. approximately 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine. My doctor said that many other women had experienced changes in their menstrual cycles, and it may only last 2 months, so I decided to wait to see if this would be the case for me. It has not. Since May 15, 2021, I have been continually bleeding and/or spotting every single day. It?s November 18, 2021. 187 days have gone by (Update 11/23/2021: 192 days have gone by).    Since the bleeding did not subside after two months, I visited my doctor in person on August 30, 2021 to discuss options for controlling the bleeding. We agreed that an ablation would be the best route for me, since I am unable to take hormonal birth control, which is typically the first route of treatment for excessive bleeding, and I am no longer considering having more children. I am unable to take hormonal birth control because it exacerbates symptoms of my diagnosed Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), which include anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation. All of this information, including my inability to take birth control due to exacerbation of PMDD symptoms, was documented by my doctor and sent to my insurance company for review and preauthorization. On October 15, 2021, I contacted Health Authority Management and spoke with a nurse who was handling the pre-authorization request sent in by Dr.?s office. I confirmed with her that my doctor had sent information regarding my inability to take hormonal birth control because of my PMDD, and reiterated this information, asking that it be taken into consideration for the preauthorization. The claim was denied on October 28, 2021. In that initial denial of preauthorization, it stated that a lack of clinical record of using hormonal birth control was one reason for the denial, which makes absolutely no logical sense, considering the aforementioned contact with Health Authority Management. Another reason given for the initial denial was that I had not undergone an endometrial biopsy to check for potential cancer. On November 12, 2021, my doctor performed an endometrial biopsy to ensure that I had a benign result for endometrial cancer. This was done in an effort to appease the other requirements of the insurance?s protocols, and to add to documentation for an appeal on my behalf. The results of the biopsy were benign. As of November 18, 2021, according to my doctor?s office, my insurance has again denied coverage for an endometrial ablation on the basis that there is no documentation that I have taken hormonal birth control as a first line of medical therapy. This is negligent, and a clear case of wrongful denial of a claim.   This condition, resulting from the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccination, has significantly inhibited my ability to function, and it is getting worse. On October 18-19, 2021, the bleeding was so excessive that I had to leave work early, and then miss an entire day of work. Starting on November 7, 2021, I began passing multiple, golf-ball sized blood clots per day. I am a middle school classroom teacher. I often have to have other teachers or aides supervise my class so that I can use the restroom to pass these blood clots. I feel physically fatigued, and have scheduled blood work to check for possible anemia and low ferritin (Update on 11/32/21: Dr.?s office received the results of my bloodwork, and it confirmed that I am in the beginning stages of anemia).  As of mid-November, I have begun to experience cramping in my lower abdomen, consistent with menstrual cramping. I cannot use tampons or my menstrual cup, because the excessive blood clots cause them to leak, so I have been wearing extra-absorbent, overnight pads, as well as disposable menstrual underwear (which is akin to wearing an adult diaper) every day. I am constantly worried that I am going to bleed through my clothing at work or outside my home. The constant wearing of pads and menstrual underwear has started to cause sores on my labia and the outer parts of my vagina, so simple movements like walking or sitting down/standing up can be very painful. These products are also not free; boxes of overnight pads are approximately $7.00 for 20 pads, and disposable menstrual underwear are approximately $7.00 for 7 pairs (I have to use multiple products per day, so one box of each of these products lasts approximately 5-7 days). On November 18, because of the secondary denial of coverage, which I knew would prolong the time in which I spent bleeding, and in an effort to reduce sores and chafing from disposable products, I purchased 2 pairs of washable period underwear, which cost me nearly $90.00. Physical intimacy in my marriage has been negatively impacted, especially as the bleeding continues to become heavier, and I become more physically and emotionally exhausted. To put it mildly, this has been humiliating. It is also taking a toll on my mental health. The constant anxiety about leaking, and worrying about my health is exhausting. In addition to all of this, if this procedure isn?t approved and performed by the end of December, I will have to incur the cost of my insurance deductible, which has already been met this year, so this will have a significant financial impact on me and my family. The continual denial of coverage for this procedure has left me feeling hopeless and angry. Every time I have used the restroom for the last 187 days (update 11/23/21 it has been 192 days), I am reminded of this awful side-effect from a vaccination I was encouraged to take, and hesitantly submitted myself to, believing that it was ?the right thing to do? for myself.

Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. Patient says that she liked to have die from that Pfizer, she hasn't been able to function or get around to do stuff for herself and her husband took the vaccine and he isn't no better. She is a nurse but she doesn't think that she is going to be anything else after this. She has been as sick as she has ever been. She is just now halfway to feeling better. How long does it take for this to wear off because she is not getting better. She states that when she had talked to her physician he said that she was referred to Pfizer since this is where she got the shot. She said she just wants to provide the fact she feels better but she has had no changes like this before and she has been in nursing for 30 years. She has talked to her physician and they said this is where she needs to talk to someone. While completing her husband's report she mentioned that they see the same primary healthcare provider. Event Details: She states that she was out of it, she was confused, she was really sick and she didn't have an appetite, she was not hungry or any of that. They began the day after she took the shot; she couldn't tell it exactly but it was right after that on the same day that she took the shot. She wasn't even in her right mind. Inquired if her side effects were ongoing and she says that some of them are but not all of them. She had stopped taking the Pfizer medicine and she hasn't had none, she has just been out of it. Her husband was no better and he couldn't take the Pfizer and she doesn't know what it was. Inquired on what side effects the patient is still having and she says that the ones that she is still having is that she is sick in her chest area, she can hardly walk at times and she is a little on the confused side. Inquired for outcome and she states that it is a little bit better but she isn't back where she was. When she walks it kind of like off balance and she is not functioning. A lady had told her to call and check with Pfizer first because that's where she got the shot from. Seriousness: She thinks that it is serious because before they got this they didn't have that. Causality: She didn't have any problems before then, she only went to get the vaccine because her doctor said that everyone was going to have to get the vaccine. She states that she didn't have any symptoms like she wasn't sick or in pain or none of those things but she hasn't been right since then. Inquired again if she believes that her side effects are related to the COVID vaccine and she says that they are related to something because she has not been right since then. The nurse told her that the patient hasn't been right since then, not at all. She has had plenty shots and she has never dealt with this. If she takes a regular shot, it is okay, but this here, no ma'am. She is not going to try and take the other part of the shot. If her reaction came from one she might not live with next one. Patient mentioned that she has never had these side effects before and it is unusual. She states she did not want to provide further information because she is feeling a little lightheaded. She says that she could call back later but she can't do it now, the light and everything is spinning. When she was informed that this DSU agent is unable to call her back she said that she needs to finish this and it is awful. With her, she had the worst of it. She was lightheaded and confused and shaking and she has never had that before. She took the 1st Pfizer dose but she is not going to take the other one because she was so sick by it and she doesn't know what Pfizer is doing for her. She was able to function and do a lot of things but then her doctor had to talk to her because she thought that death was the better off. She states in her case she was sick and hasn't been able to provide nothing and she wasn't able to go and take care of herself. She did have a great reaction to it and it was quick as can. She wants to know why no one and say anything, she was sick flat on her back ad had to work part time.

Amultisystem infl ammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and adults (MIS-A) occurring after coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identifi ed; onset is 4-6 weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A case defi nition for MIS-A has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); MIS-A after vaccination is rare and remains of great clinical and public health interest. We report a case study and histopathologic fi ndings from a fatal MIS-A case after SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent complete COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was a healthcare worker in his 30s with no notable medical history. In December 2020, he experienced mild COVID-19-like illness symptoms, including fatigue and loss of taste and smell. He did not undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 at that time and was unaware of the need for isolation. Six days after onset of COVID-19-like symptoms, and when fully recovered, the patient received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech (https://www.pfi zer.com) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. He received the second dose 20 days later. After the second dose, he reported fatigue and malaise, which resolved within 2 days. Twenty-two days after receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, he had onset of new fever, malaise, headache, and odynophagia. He was examined by an outpatient medical provider. Diagnostic testing was notable for a negative COVID-19 test by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), negative rapid influenza antigen, and negative rapid antigen detection for group A Streptococcus. Four days later, the patient visited an emergency department because of worsening symptoms. Assessment of vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.2C, heart rate 113 beats/min, and blood pressure of 117/66 mmHg. Physical examination identifi ed right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy, marked bilateral conjunctival erythema, and a faint papular rash on the pelvis and left flank. Laboratory testing revealed a peripheral-blood leukocyte count of 11,000 cells/ microL, 93.5% segmented neutrophils, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 110,000/microL (Table). Portable chest radiograph results were without notable findings. On hospital day 2, the patient remained febrile and tachycardic (heart rate 90-135 beats/min) and had a blood pressure of 92/56 mmHg. Diagnostic evaluation revealed a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test but a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG. Additional diagnostic tests were conducted (Table). Inflammatory markers showed elevated C-reactive protein at 284.0 mg/L, serum ferritin at 1434.9 ng/mL, and troponin-I at 18.0 ng/mL. On the evening of hospital day 2, the patient received 75 g of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Early morning on hospital day 3, the patient had an acute change in mental status, including confusion and global aphasia. An emergent computed tomography scan of the head was negative for cerebrovascular accident and showed normal brain parenchyma and no evidence of acute infarction, mass, or hemorrhage. On completion of the scan, the patient was found nonresponsive and without a pulse. He underwent multiple rounds of advanced cardiac life support, resulting in return of spontaneous circulation. A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, and an echocardiogram showed severe biventricular dysfunction, severe global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%. The patient received a second dose of IVIg and intravenous steroids and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was initiated. On hospital day 4, severe multisystem organ failure continued to progress. The patient died on hospital day 4. We reviewed the patients medical history and clinical chart. We assessed serum samples collected during the hospital course before and after IVIg, and we determined endpoint titers to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (IgM and IgG) and spike receptor binding domain with neutralization functions against spike protein. The endpoint titer was a modified protocol. We completed an autopsy and sent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues to CDC. Microscopic examination of lung, airways, pulmonary lymph node, liver, heart, spleen, kidneys and stomach tis sue samples was performed; LT-Gram stain was performed on lungs and heart. An RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from lungs, airways, and heart by methods previously published. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. Serum antibody results drawn before IVIg infusion were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgM but positive for IgG. Serum results had a high titer of anti-spike receptor binding domain antibody both before and after IVIg (1:75,000) compared with a naturally infected SARS-CoV-2-positive control (1:4,000). In addition, the pre-IVIG sample serum results demonstrated neutralizing function. Notable findings on gross internal autopsy examination included a 525-mL pericardial effusion and cardiac enlargement, as well as a 5-L hemoperitoneum and a 20-cm diameter perisplenic hematoma. Microscopic examination of the lungs showed diffuse congestion, increased intra-alveolar macrophages, multifocal hemorrhage, capillaritis, and microthrombi throughout. We observed no viral inclusions or diffuse alveolar damage. Trachea and bronchi showed mild tracheobronchitis. Sections of the heart showed multifocal myocarditis with mixed inflammatory infiltrate, myocyte necrosis, and numerous microthrombi. We also identified disseminated microvascular thrombosis in the heart, stomach, kidneys, and liver. Gram stain results were negative on lung and heart tissue. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative on lungs, trachea, bronchi, and heart. Conclusions This fatal case of MIS-A occurred after full COVID-19 vaccination in a patient with prior natural SARSCoV-2 infection suspected 6 weeks before MIS-A symptom onset. Serum antibody results before IVIg infusion indicated the patient was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and was vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine. Antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein are the most sensitive target for serologic diagnosis for natural infection, and these antibodies are not present following COVID-19 vaccination alone. In addition, clinical history was compatible with natural infection beginning 6 days before the first mRNA vaccine dose and consistent with negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgM on testing during hospitalization. The patient demonstrated similar clinical findings to previously reported MIS-A cases, including fever for 3 consecutive days, laboratory evidence of inflammation, neurologic and mucocutaneous clinical findings, and severe cardiac illness that included systemic hypotension progressing to cardiogenic shock. These criteria meet the CDC case definition for MIS-A, as well as a definitive case at level 1 of diagnostic certainty by the Brighton collaboration case definition for MIS-A and MIS-C. In addition, the histopathologic findings of capillaritis and multiorgan microvascular thrombosis in association with clinical symptoms and laboratory findings are compatible with MIS-A. Substantial blood loss on gross examination may represent a diffuse intravascular coagulation-type picture in which diffuse microthrombosis depleted platelets and clotting factors. The etiology for clinical deterioration was likely multifactorial, although considerabl cardiac compromise in the setting of high fluid volumes and intraperitoneal hemorrhage may have contributed to multiorgan failure Whether mRNA COVID-19 vaccination contributed to MIS-A onset in this case is unclear, and future epidemiologic studies are needed to understand whether an association exists. The immunopathology leading to hyperinflammation causing MISA after SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown, although postinfection immune dysregulation is consistent among reported cases. Notably, MIS-A has not been reported among adult participants of COVID-19 vaccine trials, and no direct evidence exists to support vaccine alone as the primary etiology in this case. This article further emphasizes the importance of COVID-19 prevention, for which infection prevention strategies and vaccination remain our greatest defense.   Table.

A 60-year-old woman developed brain death secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia following concomitant administration of methotrexate, rituximab and tozinameran [routes not stated; not all dosages and outcomes stated]. The woman, who had a medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus, had been receiving treatment with rituximab, methotrexate 25mg per week and unspecified steroids. She had also been receiving apixaban for atrial fibrillation. On 02May2021, she presented to the hospital with fever (maximum temperature 104 degree F) and productive cough for a duration of one week. She had been vaccinated with tozinameran [Pfizer] for prevention of COVID-19 disease and received the second dose of vaccination on 18February2021. On 01April2021, she underwent routine COVID testing. At that time, she was tested positive; however, she was asymptomatic. On 24April2021, she developed productive cough and fever. Therefore, she was presented to the hospital. On day of hospital presentation, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 was found to be positive. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, COVID-19 pneumonia was considered. Therefore, the woman was admitted to the hospital on 03May2021. On hospital admission, her therapy with methotrexate was stopped and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies were found to be negative. On 09May2021, she was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Therefore, she received a complex course of treatment including unspecified broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotics, remdesivir and high-dose unspecified steroids for prevention of lupus flair. During the initial 5 days of hospitalisation, she continued receiving apixaban therapy, which was subsequently stopped due to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation. On admission day 13, an altered mental status was observed, and she also reported headache. Subsequent head CT revealed a new acute to subacute infarct involving the right frontal operculum and insular region, new parenchymal haemorrhage versus haemorrhagic infarct involving the left parietal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere and multifocal acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. The CT angiogram of the head and neck showed no definite evidence of an acute large vessel intracranial arterial occlusion or substantial arterial stenosis; however, multifocal irregularity within the superior sagittal sinus with sinus venous thrombosis were noted. The brain MRI performed on the following day showed acute left middle cerebral artery territory infarct and evolution of right frontal lobe infarcts on diffusion weight imaging. The contrast-enhanced venogram showed non-occlusive superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. After interdisciplinary discussion with haematology, neurosurgery and neurology, the woman was treated with heparin drip. On admission day 19, head CT showed continued expected evolution of infarcts with sulcal effacement surrounding the dominant left sided infarcts and trace rightward midline shift. On admission day 35, final head CT revealed cessation of contrast opacification of the anterior and posterior intracranial arterial circulation as well as new cerebral oedema with effacement of the gray-white matter borders, sulci, ventricles and cisterns, haemorrhage in the right frontal and left frontoparietal lobes at the site of previous infarctions, and new hyperdensity in the sylvian fissures consistent with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, brain death secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia following pharmacodynamic interaction between methotrexate, rituximab and tozinameran was considered. Additionally, acute cerebrovascular disease was considered. Subsequently, she died due to COVID-19 pneumonia.

Author describe a case of an adolescent male patient who had recurrence of acute myocarditis temporally associated with receipt of a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech mRNA COVID19 vaccine. Case Presentation: A 17-year-old male adolescent with no significant medical history came to medical attention in Jan2021 with chest pain consistent with myocarditis. Serum troponin level peaked at 506 ngmL normal < 0.04 ng/mL. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) showed 2 small areas of delayed gadolinium enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed diffuse ST segment changes. Respiratory viral pathogen panel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 as well as SARSCoV2 nucleocapsid IgG and IgA was negative. He received supportive care and was discharged after 6 days of hospitalization with normal cardiac testing including serum troponin, EKG and echocardiogram at 2week follow-up. On 15Apr2021 he received his first dose of the PfizerBioNTech COVID19 mRNA vaccine without any side effects noted. One day after receiving the second dose of the PfizerBioNTech COVID19 mRNA vaccine on 07May2021 he developed fever T max 101.3 degree F and body aches that responded to acetaminophen. The following day he developed sudden onset of severe burning left sided chest pain that radiated to the left shoulder and the upper left arm. He reported that the chest pain worsened with exertion and movement and was similar to that experienced during his previous episode of myocarditis. He denied any other symptoms. The patient presented to our emergency department hemodynamically stable however EKG revealed diffuse ST-segment elevations. Initial laboratory test results showed a serum troponin of 23 ng/mL , C-reactive protein of 29 mg/L normal 05 mgL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 5 mmh normal < 15 mmh. Respiratory pathogen panel PCR testing including SARSCoV2 was negative. SARCoV2 nucleocapsid IgG and IgA were negative and SARSCoV2 IgM antibody for the spike protein was positive consistent with recent immunization. Rheumatologic testing including antinuclear antibody test and rheumatoid factor was negative. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for telemetry and observation Initial echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular systolic and diastolic function and no evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities or an effusion. Telemetry revealed occasional isolated premature ventricular contractions. Troponin peaked at 51.37 ngmL cMRI showed low normal left ventricular ejection fraction 53% trivial pericardial effusion and subepicardial late gadolinium in the same distribution as seen in the previous episode but with interval increased enhancement. His chest pain improved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment and supportive care and he was discharged after 6 days of hospitalization. At the time of discharge his troponin was 0.17 ngmL and EKG findings were normal At an outpatient cardiology visit 3 days after discharge the patients cardiac evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram was normal. Our patient had his first episode of idiopathic acute myocarditis 4 months before recurrence This recurrent episode of myocarditis may have been triggered by the vaccine administration through an autoinflammatory or autoimmune phenomenon Cardiac MRI during both illnesses demonstrated enhancement after gadolinium administration in the same distribution during both episodes. This case highlights the possibility that the COVID19 mRNA vaccine may trigger recurrent acute myocarditis in children and adolescents who have had a previous episode of acute myocarditis.

The rest of the day I had zero symptoms as well as no soreness in my arm from the shot. On 3/26/2021 I woke up and felt completely fine and well rested. At around 9:30am I was at a flower nursery when I began to feel extremely nauseous, anxious, and started having lightheaded/dizzy spells. I proceeded to drive home, an approximately 7 minute drive, where I immediately began to have violent vomiting and diarrhea. While this was occurring I began having muscle cramps with extreme fatigue and shaking. After 20 minutes of this my girlfriend helped me into bed. Once in bed we realized I also had a fever of 103�F. While in bed I had a cold washcloth on my forehead to try and bring down my fever. I had cold sweats and chills while in bed. For the next two hours I would periodically go back and forth from the bed to the toilet with both vomiting and diarrhea. I finally fell asleep and woke up at 7:00pm. I no longer felt nauseous, I had a temperature of 99.2�F, I felt very cold, and felt extremely fatigued. Knowing I needed fluids and nutrition, I had some chicken noodle soup with water and Pedialyte. After eating the soup, my stomach felt fine so I ate some more with bread. We went to bed around 10:00pm. I had zero nausea, no fever, but still felt very weak and exhausted. I woke up at approximately 2:30am with a diarrhea accident in bed. I immediately ran to the bathroom where I continued having diarrhea, dry heaving, stomach cramping, and shaking while my girlfriend started the laundry and put on new bedding. After 30-40 minutes being at the toilet I went back to bed where I had a fever of 101.6�F. I placed a cold washcloth on my forehead and eventually fell asleep. I did also recognize a rise in my heart rate when I would go to bed. For the next two days I laid in bed trying to rest while periodically trying to eat and drink fluids. However, I continued to vomit and have diarrhea throughout both days with fatigue and body aches. I also began to recognize a rise in my heartrate when I laid in bed. I began to feel my heart beating from my chest and in my temples. By 3/29/2021 I no longer had periodic fevers, regular nausea, or body aches but I did begin to recognize food sensitivities. For the next 10 days, I did not have a single solid stool and slowly identified foods that made me nauseous. I found my 100% Premium Grass-fed whey protein? shakes were causing nausea within 5 minutes of drinking. Before the vaccine, I never had any stomach issues drinking these protein shakes. I used this brand and this specific protein powder for 2 years on a regular daily basis. I also identified spicy foods were now causing cramping, bloating, and nausea. Which before the vaccine, I also never had a stomach related issue with at all and had a high tolerance for spicy foods. I finally found myself becoming nauseated after eating yogurt. Before the vaccine, every morning I would make parfaits with 100% grass-fed Greek yogurt, organic granola, and organic blackberries. By 4/8/2021, after recognizing foods sensitivities and adjusting my diet, I finally began to have solid stools. I have received a significant amount of vaccines due to my time in the military.

The details here will be about what happened after the second dose which I received on 6/2/21). The evening after getting the second dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine, I began to feel body aches and had a low fever. That persisted on and off for four days. The fatigue from that didn't seem to get better. As time went over over the next few weeks. I was sleeping a lot, with extreme muscle weakness. I normally exercise frequently and am a healthy adult, but it was extremely difficult to catch my breath when running, and I had trouble breathing when I was singing ( I could only sing a couple words before having to gasp for breath again). I made an appointment with my doc and she ordered blood tests. Before I could get those results, my health had declined to the point where I was taking several naps throughout the day, my muscles felt extremely weak, and joint pain (which I had never had before) was getting extreme. It was so bad I could barely walk in the morning, and my normal tennis days were impossible. I also had a bizarre stabbing pain in the top of my right foot. I began to wonder if I would be able to go back to work in the Fall (I'm a teacher). This was crazy! I'm a healthy adult woman with no health problems! I thought my life was over as I knew it. The results from my blood tests showed that I had possible lupus. I had full blood work done as part of a physical just before my vaccines and everything was normal. Out of desperation, I began a severe elimination diet to try to cut down on inflammation. (I've been a distance runner most of my adult life and was super scared my joints were getting damaged). Within a day of starting that diet (basically eating just meat), my joint pain went away. Later that month, one of the three lupus markers my doctor had tested for came back normal (the other two were still positive for possible lupus). The fatigue continued and is still present. I must take a nap daily, and leave work feeling like I can barely stay awake. I am still eating my super strict diet and as soon as I stray from it a little bit, the joint pain returns with a vengeance. I don't know how I'm going to return to a normal life.

Specialty: Family Medicine  ED Course as of 11/21/21 0151 Sun Nov 21, 2021 0137 Patient is a very pleasant 19-year-old female that presents emergency department with swelling to her upper lip that she noticed about 40 minutes prior to arrival.  She states she received her Pfizer booster and her influenza vaccine around 11:00 a.m., just after 10:00 p.m. she began developed some subjective fevers chills and body ache and neck ache and noticed swelling to her upper lip.  The Tylenol resolved all the symptoms except her lip and thus she presented to the emergency department for evaluation.  She denies any tongue swelling, no feeling her throat closing, no difficulty swallowing or breathing.  On exam she had mild upper lip swelling but thankfully the rest of her exam was reassuring.  She states her lips felt pruritic but she had no evidence of urticaria on exam.  An IV was started, the patient was provided Solu-Medrol, Pepcid, Benadryl and monitored closely for the last nearly 3 hours duration.  The patient was checked several times, the most recent of which showed improvement of her lip swelling (although not full resolution). Thankfully she is well-appearing and not showing evidence of anaphylaxis.  She has had no new symptoms or worsening symptoms.  Plan is for the patient to be able to go at the 3 hour mark.  I have written her for Prednisone for home for the next 5 days, and discussed use of OTC Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 5 days.  I have advised her that she should likely not receive any additional Pfizer COVID vaccine or the standard flu vaccine in the future.  We also discussed emergency department return precautions including a worsening of her lip swelling, swelling to her tongue, the feeling of swelling to her throat, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing.  The patient verbalized understanding instructions all questions were answered.  She and her mother were agreeable with the plan of care discharged home. [EC] 0150 Patient has been in the emergency department for 3 hours, continues to be doing well and to be discharged as previously discussed.

I then began to feel tired and went to bed at 9:30 PM and woke up at 3 AM 11/18 with excruciating under arm pain and full body pain that was unlike anything I've ever experienced. I have had the flu viruses in the past with body aches and it was nothing like that. I got up and took Aleve to try and alleviate the pain, and that's when I noticed I had severe swelling on underside of my arm on the opposite side of where I had been injected with the vaccine, and I had swelling up into armpit and around the side of my chest and into my breast and up into my collar bone around my neck to the point you couldn't see my collar bone through the skin anymore. It still is somewhat puffy, and we are a week into having the vaccine. I then proceeded to get ready for work and try to go to work because I could with 2nd dose, but by the time I got to work the Aleve had worn off around 8:30 AM and my body just hurt so bad that I had to go home. I called my doctor and asked if I needed to come in but because we're overflowed with COVID-19 patients right now I was told to go home and rest and that is what I did. The body aches didn't pass until morning on the 19th. The best way that I could describe the body pain that I felt was that if needles pushed into my joints all the way back up my neck, back, fingers, toes, and had them be pulled out and pushed back in and set on fire. It was even in my jaw, and I could feel all my teeth and the swelling in my underarm especially in my armpit felt like a water balloon in it because there was so much fluid built up from the swelling. My chest was bruised from the swelling. It's finally starting to go down and I'm able to see my collar bone through my skin again. The fever and everything else were pretty typical with the first two.

I figured that it might have been another health issue in regard to my current health issues GERD, hernia, anxiety. 10/24/2021 I noticed that I didn't sleep very well. I was very uncomfortable with the tightness in my chest being more intense. I started taking Anti-Acid thinking it might be the GERD. By Sunday night, I was really feeling the pressure and I took the nitroglycerin and waited 15 minutes with no results, so I took another one. I just laid down and gave myself a chance to rest, hoping I would maybe feel better. 10/25/2021 I felt like I was being squished and I was having difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was radiating to my neck. I called my daughter to take me to the ER, but the ambulance came instead. Was there from 10:00AM to 4:30 in the afternoon. They did a bunch of tests at the ER, and they saw some irritation and fluid around the heart. They gave me medication to relax and some for my GERD. It started to feel better but not entirely better. They prescribed me medication, but I was unable to take it because it made me nauseous and caused diarrhea. After release of the hospital, I kept trying to make the meds and it wasn't good because I became so dehydrated from diarrhea. 10/29/2021 I went to the doctor for a pre-op visit and they did an EKG and found something irregular and shipped me straight to the hospital where I was admitted for 5 days.

It ended up giving me what we call fake shingles. I had Neuralgia and Neuropathy. Apparently the COVID-19  vaccine can activate shingles. It could also be traced all the way to 2007 when I had the Statins. The neurologist checked my reflexes. I feel like they do not know what to do. After the booster vaccine I have been very tired. This whole journey has been very emotional. I went to the ER in the end of June, I took too much Magnesium and my ribs felt really tight. I called my PAC and she told me to go to urgent care. I went in and they did some lab work and by that time I was feeling better. Then I got a call saying I needed to go to the ER immediately because my blood clotting factor was high so we jumped in the car and they put me in a wheelchair. They told me I could not eat, drink, or walk because they needed to do some tests. 6 hours and a half later they put me in a room and I heard a doctor outside laughing and they did not come in. At 10:30PM I walked out and I said this was crazy. 10:50PM the doctor came in and he said they were not doing any more tests, the results of my testing were inconsistent with my age. So they said there was nothing wrong with me and they let me go home.

It started as a feeling of being in a tunnel or underwater. I realized that I could not recognize sound coming from my right ear and I couldn't understand when people talked to me.

In terms of the pressure headache, my Dr said it could be occipital neuralgia, although there has not been trauma to my head or neck. All these events happened after my 2nd shot. I am not sure if they are related to the COVID shots or not, but I would like to report them. I did not feel headaches until the initial headaches with the 1st shot and, after my 2nd one, the headache localized in the back on my head AND the sudden hearing loss. Again, I am not sure if they are related or a coincidence, but I think I should report them.  In terms of 'what's next', ENT suggested transtympanic steroid injections, although he thinks this will not work because it has been over 2 months since I noticed my hearing loss. Also suggested hearing aid.  For the headache, I am now applying heat, although my family doctor suggested gavapentin.

My teeth were chattering, and I could not warm up. I did not take my temperature but assume it had to be high. To warm up, I took a half hour shower.

I've had these feelings before where it would happen once or twice. But because this happened over and over again for many hours, that's why I contacted my doctor. These palpitations were happening for several hours for 2-3 minutes. I remember it kept me from being able to go to sleep. For the next week, I had them intermittently so it didn't happen often, but it would happen a few times a day for a few weeks. I was told to cut out the protein supplements by my doctor. But the palpitations wouldn't go away and eventually went away after a month. I still have them occasionally, but not as frequent and intense.

The patient previously received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine) (lot number: EP6955), dose 1, intramuscular, administered in the left deltoid on 29Mar2021 at 15:08 as DOSE 1, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization with no reported adverse effects. On 28Apr2021, the day following the patient's second dose, she noticed that her left foot was flaccid, dragging and unable to lift it. In two days it continued and progressed to her left knee. In two days it continued and progressed to her right foot, in two days to her right knee and continued to her right hip. At this point , she was unable to walk and could only manage a sliding gait and required use of a cane. The patient also became incontinent on an unspecified date, because she could no longer get to the restroom in her normal timely manner. The patient made an appointment with her primary physician, who thought she had some type of aging disease and referred her to a neurologist. The neurologist ordered a CT scan and an MRI of her brain. Occupational & Physical therapies were prescribed and the patient was referred for a second opinion to specialist because of ""gradient susceptibility"" and a need to determine whether the patient needed to stop her prescribed baby aspirin and coumadin. The Neurologist instructed her to continue those medications but commented that the patient walked like a drunk. Both neurologists could not determine a cause for her sudden onset ambulation issues. Despite her stroke which resulted in loss of 25% of my abilities, the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine resulted in an additional loss of 40% of her capabilities. Her gait was now unsteady and she must use an assistive device (cane) that she never needed after her stroke. The adverse event created a financial, physical and emotional hardship for her. To have survived a stroke with a great outcome, but only to have the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine leave her more impaired is a difficult situation to be dealt. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (11Aug2007): there are no areas of acute intracranial hemorrhage or abnormal extra-axial fluid accumulation, no midline shift or mass effect. Small, wedge-shaped region of slightly decreased attenuation is seen within the posterior left temporal parietal lobe, likely representing small region of subacute ischemia. Tiny region of slightly decreased attenuation is noted within the right side of pons, consistent with region of old ischemia from prior infarct as noted on prior MRI study.
