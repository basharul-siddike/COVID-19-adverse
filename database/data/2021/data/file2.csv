His throat felt swollen and he experienced shortness of breath (""heavy breathing"") with no wheezing or stridor, but with chest tightness that he felt was possibly related to anxiety about receiving the vaccine and the potential for allergic reaction. No supplemental oxygen was required. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 145, with normal blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation. After a few more minutes, he started to feel numbness and tingling in his mouth and tongue. He experienced diaphoresis (""drenched in a cold sweat""), skin pallor (""skin was severely pale""), felt faint, and reported that his blood pressure was undetectable by a monitor. He did not lose consciousness and denied any skin rash. The patient felt he was developing an allergic reaction and self-administered his personal epinephrine auto-injector. He felt better within five to six minutes after self-administration of epinephrine and was taken by stretcher to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, and numbness.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient's concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient's past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient's heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn't quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn't have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from ""Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine"".

On 4 Jan 2021, the partially used vial was used to vaccinate at least six patients. On 5 Jan 2021, the Immunizations Team was discussing wasted vaccines and was reminded of the 6 hour expiration timeframe once a vial is punctured.  One of the members realized that they used the above mentioned open vial on 4 Jan 2021 well beyond the 6 hour timeframe. In addition, once a vial is punctured and brought to room temperature, placing the vial back into the refrigerator will invalidate the vial and make it unusable.  Mission Impact: A minimum of six patients received invalidated vaccine. Consultation with AGENCY concurred the doses given from this vial should be considered invalid and recommend that all patients who received vaccine from this vial be revaccinated. Corrective Action Required/Taken:  Agencies were notified to report the patient safety error.  The team identified ten patients who did or possible did receive the invalid vaccine.  After consulting with Risk Management, the Healthcare Resolution Specialist and AGENCY, all ten patients were contacted, received full disclosures, and were recommended to receive repeat Dose 1 as soon as possible.  Eight patients were revaccinated on 6 Jan 2021.  Two declined revaccination and plan to get Dose 2 as previously scheduled.  A Concise Incident Analysis (mini- Root Cause Analysis) is being conducted to determine root causes and ensure effective process improvements are implemented.",,,,,,,,,,01/04/2021,01/04/2021,0,,MIL,,,,,,,2,01/08/2021,,,,

At the time of my 1st injection, I had also had 2 other injections simultaneously (one for flu and the other for TDap).  This time, on New Years Eve, my only injection was the Shingrix shot.  Within 10 hours of the injection, despite the fever/pain reducer, I began to feel feverish.  Within 12 hours I was suffering greatly.  High fever, chills, body ache, joint pain (especially my hands, thumbs, knees and hips).  I continued taking acetominophen every 4 hours, but the symptoms did not ease until January 2, 2021 at about 10AM.  I was left feeling very weak, very worn out; tired, achy, dizzy.  My reaction this time was at least as bad as my original injection.  (This was still administered at a facility, but a different one in my town.  My other prescription number administered on 10/30/20 was RX#0776924-11712.  You sent me a follow-up question asking about batch numbers, etc., and the NDC # on the 10/30 prescription is the same as it is on the 12/31 form.  I don't know how that is possible since its from 2 different stores many miles apart?)  I have honestly never felt so sick, so weak, so afraid that it was nearing the end for me, that I might actually die from this.  My breathing was shallow, labored.  I did manage to keep hydrated, in small increments, even though I felt incredibly nauseous.  My symptoms persisted from 3:00 am on 1/1/21 until 10:00 am on 1/2/21.

I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm.

I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl.

The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn't know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn't have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn't seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn't have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn't given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine.

Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender's Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

Took tylenol with little result. Following day called pharmacy who said DTAP is known to be uncomfortable and they ""never use needles longer than 1 inch."" By Wed 9/23 arm was not improving so called insurance advice nurse who said go to urgent care but declined to avoid unnecessary covid exposure. She said to wear arm sling and use Voltaren gel because I cannot tolerate NSAIDS. Following morning I had a virtual appointment with my primary care physician who said to minimize use of sling to avoid frozen shoulder, keep using Voltaren and ask physical therapist currently treating me for rehab post back surgery 6/2020 to add shoulder exercises, and let her know if still not better in 4 weeks at which time she would refer me to Physical Medicine specialist for nerve testing. I found I had to wear sling at work (part time librarian) but was able to get by at home without it. By 4 weeks the pain and limited range of motion was improving, by then I could drive and dress myself, but it took a further 2-3 weeks to resolve fully. Primary care physician at checked with immunizations clinic supervisor who asked if the pharmacy tech had been standing (and if I were sitting) for the injection. Yes to both. Immunization clinic chief said this (bad) practice can sometimes direct the needle into the nerve or joint capsule, which may have happened in my case.

While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty.

Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i've also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn't confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.

I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches.

Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle.
