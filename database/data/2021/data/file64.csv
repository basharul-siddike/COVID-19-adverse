His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks.

He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything.

In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable.

The reporter's causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender's Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine.

I suggested that she could choose to inform her healthcare provider and to certainly report any adverse effects. The recipient reported mild cramping in her left hand while we were talking to her during the post observation. And she indicated that this might have been a psycho somatic symptom.

Bad hit on helmet, and I was unconscious for probably five minutes.  I was found and woken up by a passerby (I have no memory of this) and then the EMTs arrived.  Checked into Emergency Room.  They suspected a cardiac event, but I have so far passed all the tests (exercise stress test, echocardiogram, normal QT).  I have *never* had an event like this, the bike ride, while a little long, was quite normal for me.  I also note that I had possibly not had enough to eat or drink that morning.  So, based on the curious timing of this event, I personally believe it's related to the shot.  I also don't really believe this is an anxiety related syncopal event (it was more than an hour after the shot), but rather I suspect an immune response, perhaps aggravated by dehydration/lack of enough food.  But who knows?  I was out cold, and don't remember the minute or so up to the crash.

Tuesday Major stiffness felt like passing out in the shower, went to the Pool. Therapist had me keep arms lowered in the water flexing and stretching to get fluid to move. Felt a little better, but weak. Still burping for no reason. Still pain on right side of neck. Tuesday and Wednesday night same thing happened, chills then sweating. Thursday in the pool was tough.  Chills and sweating again at night. Major stiffness Friday, Sat and Sunday mornings. All day burping and hands very stiff/cold. Used heating pad to loosen up hands. 3/15 Monday morning woken up with chills again, hands so stiff and legs throbbing, having a difficult time getting out of bed. Went to take a shower, thought I was going to pass out. Pain on left side of neck. Stiffness elbows to finger tips. 3/16 and 3/18 pool therapy giving some relief with stiffness in hands and legs.  3/19 to 3/22 woke up with stiffness in hands to elbows. Left arm where the injection shot was given felt like someone was snapping an elastic on my arm every couple of minutes. Finally got it to go away by putting heating pad on it every morning. I also put heat on stiff hands, that seems to work a little. But the burping still won?t stop, my stomach just keeps rolling no matter what I eat or drink. On days that I did not have pool therapy it would take 3 to 6 hrs to get hands to loosen up using heating pad. 3/23 went to pool therapy, had a tough time walking in/out. Legs feel like they can?t hold me up. Therapist had me work out again, trying to move the fluid out of my legs and arms/hands. By the time I got home hands were cold and stiff, feet feel tingly.. 3/23 Called primary care to discuss fluid in hands and legs, got the OK from both Dr?s to take fluid pill and also a Prednisone (4 days only) to flush my system. 3/24 to 3/26 still getting the chills and stiffness in hands, not a bad, finally going away?? Hopefully. 3/26 to 3/29 hands are finally loosening up, not as much stiffness, only takes couple of hrs. of get hands to function. This has been a very difficult recovery..

Eventually, the patient was admitted for sepsis 2/2 UTI and now with concerns for remote stroke with persistent dysphagia and acute encephalopathy.   Since April 9th, the family has noted that the patient has had difficulty swallowing baby food and seems to be uncomfortable; she is able to make a couple of audible sounds or gestures that suggest pain and that is why they brought her. The family also reports that the patient received her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 04/07/2021.   On 04/08/2021, the patient had one staring episode, but then returned to baseline. She was at baseline during breakfast on the morning on 04/09/2021, but around lunchtime, she had another staring spell and was unable to swallow food as well as unable to walk, stand, or move her lower extremities. The patient has limited language at baseline but also has not been able to say the few words she used to communicate with her family, only moaning and grunting since that time. Since 04/09, she has not been able to consume any solid foods, only eating a very small amount of smashed/liquified fruit and drinking Pedialyte. Sister has been massaging her legs regularly in hopes of re-establishing movement but saw nothing until yesterday (05/05/2021) when the patient moved toes bilaterally and briefly lifted her right leg.    Neurology Consult on 05/05/2021:  The patient had mildly bradycardiac and hypertensive (170s/80s). Labs reviewed and showed mildly elevated WBC (i.e., 12.9 K/MM3) and urinalysis was consistent with UTI.  Imaging was reviewed and consistent with chronic CVA, likely occurring on 04/09/2021 while the patient was in hypercoagulable post-COVID vaccine state.   Neurology recommends CT angio head and neck, TTE w/ bubble, A1c, fasting lipid panel, DVT prophylaxis via lovenox 40mg SC daily, D-dimer levels, EKG, PT/OT?Speech therapy evals, BP control via lisinopril 10mg daily w/ goal of < 140/90, and ASA 81mg daily",,,,,Y,3,,Y,U,04/07/2021,04/08/2021,1,"Imaging on 05/06/2021:  CT and MRI Impression: Ill-defined focus of restricted diffusion with blood products, FLAIR hyperintensity, and patchy heterogenous enhancement in the posterior right frontal lobe.

Asymmetric atrophy of the left cerebral hemisphere relative to the right with increased FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity. This is nonspecific and may be due to tosequela of a remote cerebral insult such as encephalitis or a remote vascular insult.

CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY:   PRESENTING PROBLEM: Patient is a 83 y.o. male with Hx of HTN who presents today with complaint of right sided flank pain, with radiations into the right side of his back and right side of his chest. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration. He denies palpitations and shortness of breath. He has no previous HX of VTE. He denies fever, chills, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat. He denies abdominal pain, N/V, and changes in bowel movements. The patient is a limited historian. He is oriented x4 on admission, but states that he has had difficulty with his memory over the past 2-3 years. He lives alone in an apartment.   In the emergency department the patient's vital signs were stable.  Labs revealed a potassium of 3.3.  AST was 52 and ALT 61. White blood cell count was 11.13.  Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits.  Lactic acid was 1.5.  UA showed trace blood.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs.  CTA the thorax abdomen and pelvis showed acute pulmonary emboli involving the segmental subsegmental arteries of the upper and lower lobes.  There is no evidence of heart strain. He was admitted for observation due to severe pain, and was given IV fentanyl.  Echocardiogram showed: The left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 36 mmHg. The inferior vena cava was not visualized during the exam. There is no comparison study available.    He was started on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for total of 3 months.  He should follow up with PCP in 1 week and should check CBC and BMP on 5/10/21. He should also follow up with pulmonologist in 2-3 months.  He had Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/18/21 and 3/18/21. There is remote possibility that this PE could be related to COVID-19 vaccine, so this was reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). He had mild hypokalemia due to HCTZ, and required K-dur supplement. HCTZ was switched to Maxzide 25/37.5 mg daily. Rechecked K was normal 3.9. BMP should be checked in 1 week. Also he is drinking little bit too much alcohol, 4 alcoholic drinks every night. He was instructed to cut alcohol drinking to </=2 alcoholic drink a day.

In general, I think that there is a strong suspicion that his symptoms may be related to his second COVID vaccine yesterday.""",PVT,,Dexilant 60 mg capsule gabapentin 100 mg capsule (3x) mirtazapine 7.5 mg tablet mirtazapine 15 mg tablet aspirin 81 mg DR tablet metoprolol succinate 25 mg 24 hr tablet lisinopril  5 mg tablet  rosuvastatin 20 mg tablet cholecalciferol 125,N/A,Coronary Artery Disease Irritable Bowl Syndrome,,,2,05/06/2021,,,Y,Penicillin Valacyclovir Spinach Shellfish Derived Animal Dander

I went to urgent care on 4/15 for severe shortness of breath. At the urgent care the did a chest X-ray and EKG and they were both fine. The doctor prescribed a 5 day course of prednisone to calm the inflammation down in my lungs. After two days of taking the prednisone the shortness of breath was worse.  On 4/19 I went to the Emergency Room because of the shortness of breath and pain in my back and sides. The doctor ordered a CT Scan of my chest and lungs and labs. The test showed no blood clots but the blood test that determines if you have a clot or that will lead a doctor to get a CT Scan was elevated. The doctor said I was basically ok because I did not have any blood clots. She said I was experiencing some type of respiratory issue. On 4/22/21 I saw an allergist to see if I had some type allergic reaction to the vaccine. My allergist said there was no way to test the components in the vaccine but he did test me for other things. On 4/26/21 I followed up with my PCP and he gave me Maloxicam and a pain medication to take if I needed it. I was in so much pain in my sides that I couldn?t put my arms down comfortably. I continued taking two Tylenol?s every 6 hours. On 4/30/21 I saw my pulmonologist to discuss my symptoms and he talked about the prednisone suppressing my immune system so the one shot that I did get won?t really cover me. He changed my inhaler earlier this year and he said he should have left it where it was because of the time of year and my allergies.

Abnormal (paradoxical) septal motion consistent with RV volume overload The right ventricle is severely dilated. Right ventricular free wall is akinetic The left atrium is not well visualized. There is a very large echodensity in the right atrial cavity, most consistent with thrombus. The right atrium is severely dilated. At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The tricuspid regurgitant jet is eccentrically directed. The calculated right ventricular systolic pressure suggests Moderate (40-70 mmHg) pulmonary hypertension. The aortic root is normal size. Inferior vena cava size is normal with decreased respirophasic changes. Trivial pericardial effusion.  Procedure A two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram with color flow and Doppler was performed. Location: Portable. Routine.  LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The left ventricular ejection fraction is grossly normal. Abnormal (paradoxical) septal motion consistent with RV volume overload.  RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricle is severely dilated. Right ventricular free wall is akinetic.  LEFT ATRIUM/ATRIAL SEPTUM: The left atrium is not well visualized.  RIGHT ATRIUM: The right atrial thrombus is large in size. The right atrium is severely dilated.  AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve is trileaflet.  MITRAL VALVE: The Mitral valve is not well visualized.  TRICUSPID VALVE The tricuspid valve is grossly normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is calculated to be 50.5 mmHg. The calculated right ventricular systolic pressure suggests Moderate (40-70 mmHg) pulmonary hypertension. The tricuspid regurgitant jet is eccentrically directed.

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 20Apr2021 08:26 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing hypertension, ongoing mitral valve prolapse, ongoing Tarlov cysts and ongoing mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. The patient had a neurological condition caused Tarlov Cysts. These cysts populated right outside of the dorsal root nerve system. In her, it's cervical vertebra #5 all the way down her spine bilaterally. In May2018, she had a surgical procedure, not an aspiration, for 8 of the nerves in her sacrum. She has had complications ever since. Cervical vertebra #7 and #8 have been giving her the most problems.  Concomitant medications included ongoing oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone terephthalate, paracetamol (PERCOCET) 10mg every 4 hours taken for pain, and her doctor recently changed it; ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) injection and something for acid reflux but she did not think that's relevant. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm right on 16Mar2021 9:48AM for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 59-year-old and she had no problems just soreness in her arm. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. She had her second Covid 19 vaccine yesterday morning, 20Apr2021. Cervical vertebra #8 through Lumbar vertebra #5 was very, very painful from 20Apr2021. She didn't know or hasn't heard if the Covid 19 vaccine is associated with her back pain. This pain that she's having now didn't feel like the pain she had related to her Tarlov cysts.  Before the Covid 19 vaccine she had no problems until late last night (20Apr2021) and early this morning (21Apr2021). She was in excruciating pain. She reported it's complicated for her to make that mind adjustment. She texted her cousin this morning at 6:30AM (21Apr2021) because she had to let her cousin know what was going on. If her cousin texts and she doesn't respond, her cousin will do a welfare check. She doesn't want a welfare check so she told her cousin to just let her sleep, let her see how she feels when she's up again. She reported sometimes when the Tarlov cysts were bothering her she could lay on her back and it would soothe her pain. This time that was not working. She reported she had her vertebra and her discs and then her outer muscular system to the flank, that is where it was painful. She didn't know if this is normal. She was hearing normal side effects like tiredness and fatigue, she was not having those because she was not normal. She was 1 in 2 billion with her Tarlov cysts. She has complications with her Tarlov cysts. She has mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. She has Tarlov cysts from Cervical vertebra #5 bilaterally down. She had multiple cysts. She didn't know if the Covid 19 vaccine was aggravating her back. She reported she has 2 nervous systems, her parasympathetic and her sympathetic nervous system. She reported this is in her parasympathetic nervous system. She reported sensory, if she touches something hot, she knew it was hot. She reported this is so important. She had muscle tenderness and muscle tightness from 20Apr2021and that's it. She knew what she was taking about because she was using medical terminology. The pain felt like someone kicked her in her kidneys. The kidneys, where the waist is on her back to the top of her sacral area and up the spine to where her first rib is and go outward, that's where her pain was, from thoracic vertebra 12 to lumbar 5.  The only different thing she's done was get the Covid 19 vaccine. She was trying to triage herself. She didn't know what else to do. The Percocet was not even fixing it. She wanted to make sure the Covid 19 vaccine wasn't exacerbating her disease. She thought that's what's happening. She was in a lot of pain. Her pain was the same before and after when she took the Percocet. Normally the Percocet calmed her down to where she's functional and the Percocet was not. Percocet was 10-325mg, oxycodone and acetaminophen. Take one 4 times daily as needed for pain. The Percocet was a pharmacy bottle. In order for her to have a quality of life she also took Ketorolac or Toradol. She hadn't taken that today (21Apr2021). She picked her prescriptions up at the same time she received her Covid 19 vaccine.  She can lay on the ground on her back sometimes and her pain will be alleviated. Now laying on her back exacerbates her pain. She didn't know if it's muscular. If she was diagnosing herself, she would say it's not muscular. She knew enough about Tarlov cysts that she knew how to rule it out. She reported her felt feels like it's punching her lungs.  She reported it's so hard to explain. She's trying to separate the pain she has from her Tarlov cysts from what she's experiencing now. She reported her pain was a 10 plus in both flanks. She stated people will call flanks ""the sides"". The only reason she knows it's a flank is because she had learn anatomy real quick with her Tarlov cysts. On the date of her first Covid 19 vaccine she had a steroid injection and a Toradol injection. With her second Covid 19 vaccine she had a Toradol injection. The pharmacist told her there would be no conflict in receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. she has to suffer through it until her pain subsides. It feels like it's kicking the heck out of her back. When she lays supine she can alleviate some of the pain associated with the Tarlov cysts but that's not working.  She can't stand or lay supine, all of that is out the window. Meaning it's not working. This pain has to be the Covid 19 vaccine. She's in a lot of pain and she didn't need the vaccine to exacerbate her pain. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office.

April 21:  Day 8; This evening I started feeling a tightness in my chest that felt like what I imagine heartburn feels like, as if something was stuck deep in my esophagus and every time it squeezed I felt pain.  It was painful to take a big breath, I got painful hiccups frequently but not long lasting, and occasional painful twinges like a quick squeeze. April 22:  Day 9; I woke up with a really sore front of the neck, like I had frontal whiplash.  It was painful to move too much, to cough, sneeze, swallow, hiccup. Also got a sensation off and on in my left arm like it was buzzing with alcohol, and occasional twinges of pain or a general light ache. Still had the chest tightness, off and on.  Some days it would last a full day, others it seemed to just act up lightly a few times throughout the day. These symptoms went away by April 24 or 25.

Swollen lymph node as well.  The neck muscles on the left side were also sore. My head felt hot to the touch, as if it had a rash. My chest starting hurting again like before, but not as badly (hiccups, big breaths were painful and restricted).  Got the left arm twinges, too, but not as bad. The itchy inner ear lasted two full days, waking me up throughout the night two nights in a row. April 30:  Day 17; I went to urgent care and got an EKG, chest x-ray, and blood tests done.  All results were normal.  The doctor said my ear was red inside and that it must be an ear infection (caused by unknown reasons).  There was no visible rash on the outside (no shingles present).  She prescribed antibiotics, which I planned to fill, but the next day the itching was gone on its own, so I did not take the antibiotics. She had no thoughts on explanation for the other symptoms.

Physician Addendum, Specialty: Internal Medicine Cardiovascular Disease, Date of Service: 5/4/2021 10:08 AM, INPATIENT DISCHARGE SUMMARY, Admission Date: 5/3/2021, Discharge Date: 5/4/2021, HOSPITAL SUMMARY, Discharge Diagnosis, Principal Problem: Other acute myocarditis, Active Problems: Chest pain, Tobacco use, Resolved Problems: * No resolved hospital problems. * Reason for Hospitalization, Acute myocarditis after COVID vaccination, Hospital Course - Patient is a very pleasant 20-year-old man without prior medical history who was transferred here from emergency department for further management of chest pain. Patient received his second COVID-19 vaccination on Friday, April 30, 2021 (Pfizer). Later in the evening on Friday, he developed constitutional symptoms, including fever/chills/sweats as well as severe back pain. These symptoms subsided by the following morning but later in the day on May 1, 2021, he developed significant substernal chest pain. The chest pain persisted throughout the weekend. It was worse when he took a deep breath in and also had a positional component. He identified no other aggravating or alleviating factors. When his pain had not resolved, he presented to the emergency department early in the morning on May 3, 2021. On arrival to the outside hospital emergency department, his electrocardiogram was unremarkable, aside from early repolarization abnormality. His troponin was significantly elevated to 7.3. His COVID test was negative. All other lab work was unremarkable, including an undetectable D-dimer. He was transferred here for further management of chest pain and troponin elevation. On arrival here, we completed a CT coronary angiogram, which showed no evidence for coronary stenosis and normal origin of the coronary arteries from the aortic root. An echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function and no valvular heart disease. It was, overall, an unremarkable echocardiogram. His troponin was trended and peaked at 7.3. A follow-up troponin after that was 6.4. His presentation is presumed to be related to acute myocarditis secondary to the COVID vaccination. We are obtaining a cardiac MRI as an outpatient on May 4, 2021 (the day after discharge). He will be provided with a one-month supply of colchicine, which he will take daily. We attempted to start him on both Toprol XL and losartan, but we had to discontinue the Toprol XL due to bradycardia (heart rates in the 40-to-50 beats per minute range, increasing only up to 60 beats per minute with activity). He will, therefore, be discharged only on losartan. We will plan to obtain a repeat cardiac MRI in 3-6 months. If that study is favorable, the losartan could be discontinued. Finally, patient had a trip planned with his family to celebrate his 21st birthday in the near future. This trip would obviously involve heavy alcohol consumption. Because alcohol is a cardiotoxin, I advised against such a trip until he has more time to recover from his myocarditis (I also reminded him that heavy alcohol consumption in general is not advised). I provided him a letter that they can use as they cancel their travel plans and seek reimbursement.

I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I'd wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.

After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results ""there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.""   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain.

She had additional heart tests scheduled with a cardiologist. She had Covid-19 in Nov2020 which showed sars-cov-2 test positive and had antibodies present when drawn during BP episode and they were 214/101. She had an antibody test with her doctor. She has the results from the antibody test. She asked if there was a certain antibody number that would say she did not need the second dose. She enquired if she should wait to get her second vaccine dose and if it was needed to repeat both doses. She went to town for a new blood pressure cuff because with her old cuff, her blood pressure was going over 200. Her husband suggested there could be something wrong.

She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn't super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn't done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn't stop and she told herself that if it didn't stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn't been eating a lot so she hasn't had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn't swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can't recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn't even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn't really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn't help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren's disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events ""Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous"" was recovered on 17Apr2021.

Medical history included tick bite, blood pressure, nerve pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sciatica. The patient had no family history. The patient had no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) of the COVID vaccine. Ongoing concomitant medications included olmesartan for blood pressure, duloxetine for nerve pain, omeprazole for GERD, famotidine for GERD; all taken for years, meloxicam for sciatica taken for 2 months and ongoing and doxycycline from 16Apr2021 and ongoing for tick bite (reported that she kept forgetting to take it).

That dose went in the deltoid and she had no issues. Then she received the second dose on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 in the left arm. She believes it was administered in the soft tissue behind the deltoid. She noticed the person who gave the injection went behind the muscle toward the back of the arm. The next day after the second dose, she felt fine. Then the second morning it felt as if her shoulder was dislocated; and her breast is hard and painful; and she can't breath. She called her doctor who said that was not a common side effect but she stated she knows it is a side effect. The doctor recommended she go to the ER but patient didn't want to go. She stated that she doesn't know if missing the muscle is going to let the medication absorb or if it has penetrated the soft tissue. The clinical course of events was further described as follows: On 20Apr2021 at 08:00, the second morning, she woke up and felt severe pain in her right breast and shoulder all the way to back; adds she can't move her arm and her breast is so painful she can't touch it and her shoulder is immobile. She is also having very bad shortness of breath, adds she thought that may be from anxiety; so later in the day she took a alprazolam (XANAX). She added that she put up with the pain all morning and thought maybe she was working herself up so she took one half of a Xanax to calm down, to see if it was just anxiety but the shortness of breath and pain were still there.

I can push on one spot and the headache gets much worse. I took 50mg Imitrex an hour ago. It's bow 457am 5/7 and the headache went right away. I'm now having hot flashes and had to take my shirt off. Not sure if it's the medication or both. This is unusual for me to feel hot when it's 58F outside and 71F inside.

1295509,05/07/2021,TX,16.0,16,,F,,"My 16-year-old daughter, very healthy without any health conditions, got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday evening, April 10th, at around 5pm. On Wednesday, she started complaining of shortness of breath, chest pains, which she described as a feeling of someone stubbing her heart. By Thursday, she began blacking out repeatedly throughout the day, each blackout lasting about a minute. These progressed and whenever she blacked out, she would not remember what happened. At first, she and I brushed it off as maybe lack of calcium since she rarely drinks milk. But as they intensified, I began to become more concerned. I told her I cannot leave her by herself in the house as I prepared to go pick up her young siblings from school then schedule an appointment with her doctor. On our way back home, she blacked out again, however, it was for more than a minute. Straight away, I drove to the  ER close by. The doctor came back to inform me that her heartbeat was irregular and concerning based on her age. In that same moment, she began complaining of excessive pain like someone punching her heart out, and then she passed out again. Still with my two other children, the whole ordeal began to frighten them and illicit some heavy tears.  Being that this ER was general admission, the doctors insisted they call in the paramedics to transport her to another ER for children. However, after being transported to the other ER, her condition began to intensify rather quickly and the pediatric doctor at the second ER informed us we would have to be transferred to Childrens intensive care unit where the cardiologists could check her heart, find the ultimate cause, and monitor her closely. In that moment, as a mother, I was speechless and extremely terrified. Seeing my daughter being transferred from ER to ER, made it even tougher on me so much that I could no longer hold myself together. Here she was in terrible pain and being moved around with no clear diagnosis and treatment.  From there on, we spent a couple days in the Cardiac ICU waiting and praying with friends for answers and the best treatment she could get to ease the pain. By about the third day of being in the ICU, the cardiologists informed me, she had Acute Myocarditis. This was so shocking in a sense that both sides of the family have no history of heart issues. Secondly, she is a very healthy child.",,,,,Y,5,,,U,04/10/2021,04/14/2021,4,,SCH,,Vitamin C,None,None,,,2,05/07/2021,,,Y,None

1295618,05/07/2021,VA,24.0,24,,M,,"A week and a half approximately after the initial vaccination of the J+J covid vaccine I started having a course of strange symptoms. Insomnia, inability to focus on things directly in front of me (a hand in front of my face would go out of focus automatically after a second), blurred vision, short term/long term memory loss, severe emotional issues, difficulty breathing, anxiety. Shortness of breath at a certain point was so bad I thought I was not going to make it. One very troublesome symptom that culminated after weeks of 4 hours of sleep was that my brain started feeling ""funny"". The best way to describe it was a brain ""orgasm"" which I have never experienced before. At the same time I experienced dry heaving for several minutes, and severe shortness of breath. After this experience my symptoms gradually improved over the next week or two. Prior to this it felt like my brain was not getting enough oxygen/blood, which could have been feeding my insomnia. When I would try to sleep, I would wake up at 4 am gasping for air, as I felt like my breathing was labored when sleeping. I could not focus on my computer screen to do my job at home. Large amounts of melatonin seemed to help my brain feel better and get some rest. I took hydroxyzine for unrelated reasons prior to the vaccine injection as needed, however not too often. During  March I did not take it, as I had experienced disruptions in circadian rhythm due to the medication. I feel it is possible I had a blood clot that has been described in the news, although now there may be no way to know for sure. I talked with  my primary care physician about this, and he did not think this was the case because I was male. However I have a BMI of 18.7 and some issues females have such as TMJ and inability gain weight/anorexia diagnosis when younger. I also was recently diagnosed with an only recently described actual medical issue called R-CPD, which is the complete inability to burp or belch. I felt like during the time when I experienced the side effects, that this condition was heightened (bloating/loss of appetite). I lost quite a bit of weight during March, I usually weigh 135-140, and was down to 115 at a certain point. I am now back up to 130.   I now take sertraline at 1/4 pill dosage to treat the anxiety I experienced as a result of these symptoms as well as some other personal issues. I experienced severe side effects from the sertraline taking it at full dosage, and still experience some at 1/4 pill dosage.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/06/2021,03/15/2021,9,"My partner who I am no longer with was a symptomatic covid person, and I was exposed to this person intimately. At the end of January when we broke up, I got nearly a dozen PCR swabs through a pharmacy, all coming back negative, but I was 100% exposed through saliva, bodily fluids, and just sleeping in the same bed. It is possible I had long-covid symptoms prior to receiving the J+J vaccine. I never experienced symptoms, and all tests came back negative, but I did not swab very far up my nose as the pharmacy makes you swab yourself.   In March I went to the emergency room where I was told I had anxiety/depression. I went to an immediate care where I also described sexual dysfunction symptoms, although I have no recollection of this encounter (I received a bill in the mail).

Patient is known Covid positive.  She arrives tachycardic, mildly hypertensive with oxygen saturations of 93% on room air.  Given duration of symptoms, gradual onset and no use of blood thinners or recent trauma, I do have low suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute intracranial hemorrhage such as subdural or epidural.  Patient's COVID-19 infection is thought to put her at slightly increased risk for hypercoagulable state.  Given calf tenderness on the left side, cannot exclude DVT resulting in PE.  Patient symptoms could also be secondary to venous sinus thrombosis.  To assess for these critical pathologies, patient will require multiple imaging studies, including CT angiogram of chest as well as MRI venogram.  Patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to pain and mild dehydration.  Will treat with Compazine, Benadryl for analgesia as well as management of nausea, and provide 500 IV fluid bolus.  Also provide Tylenol for management of low-grade oral temperature, which could also be contributing to tachycardia.  Patient is in no acute respiratory distress, does not have supplemental oxygen requirement at this time.  No acute indication for steroids.   We will continue to reassess patient while imaging studies are pending.  Will provide additional analgesia as needed.

1295951,05/07/2021,OR,28.0,28,,M,,"Last weekend on Sunday morning (April 25th), I received my second shot of Pfizer vaccine at 9am.  My body started to show some side effects on the evening of Sunday. I felt super cold around 10 pm and at the same time, I had a fever, too. I went to bed early that night (around 10:30 pm) and since I was super cold, I had 3-4 blankets on me when I was on my bed. Suddenly, at 1 am, I woke up due to a very strange noise in my head (a very low-volume noise of knocking on the door every 10 seconds!! I think it was only something in my mind). Since I couldn't sleep because of that low artificial noise, I decided to go to the bathroom at around 1:10 am (My bode was also in lots of pain at that time). When I started to walk, I realized that something is wrong with my body. When I peed and stood up to get back to my bed, I noticed that I'm losing control! Therefore, I hit the bathroom door to wake up my girlfriend, and then I fainted! (I can't remember anything for about 30 seconds here). My girlfriend told me that when I fainted, one of my eyeballs was upward and the other was downward (like zombies!!). She started to freak out and called her mom, but once they started talking, I woke up. My body was soaking wet when I woke up and I was in lots of pain. I asked her to help me to lay down on the ground. After 10 minutes, that my sweats were gone, I started feeling cold and asked her to give me a blanket. I couldn't sleep for about 2-3 hours after I fainted, but I was feeling better (I was much better than the time before fainting). On Monday afternoon, I called the health center and told them my side effects. They strongly recommended visiting ER ASAP since the symptoms that I described were severe side effects of Pfizer. Therefore, I went to ER on Monday (April 26th) to see what?s the issue. Hopefully, after spending 3-4 hours there, and passing some tests, the results did not show anything wrong with my body, but just the side effects of the vaccine.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/25/2021,04/25/2021,0,,UNK,,NA,NA,NA,,,2,05/07/2021,,,Y,NA
