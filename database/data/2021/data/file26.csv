Medical history included: he had tested positive asymptomatically for COVID due to contact contamination on 02Jan2021 or 03Jan2021, blood pressure, and A-fib (atrial fibrillation). Concomitant medication included ongoing metoprolol for blood pressure. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient stated that he got sick after getting the vaccine (on 30Jan2021) and had an important question. He got a fever (31Jan2021) and all that stuff that lasted like a day and a half after getting the vaccine, just like a million other people. But he missed the part about asking a doctor about taking his blood thinner, which he took as normal up through the day that he got the vaccine and the next morning, then he stopped it. The patient clarified that he got the vaccine on Saturday (30Jan2021), stopped the blood thinner on Sunday (31Jan2021), the sickness subsided around Monday (as reported), but he still hasn't gone back on the blood thinner. He wanted to know when it was safe for him to start taking the blood thinner again, and he needed to know what to do for the second vaccine. The clinical course was as follows: He got the first dose of the vaccine on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 and at 22:00 he started feeling hot through the night. On Sunday, 31Jan2021, he had 103 degree fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. He clarified that he recovered completely by Wednesday, 03Feb2021. He had been on Eliquis for years for A-Fib. He stopped taking it once he got sick after getting the vaccine and went back and read the material and noticed what it said about the blood thinner. He did not go to the emergency room or physician's office. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban was temporarily withdrawn. The outcome of the events was recovered on 03Feb2021.

Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed about 14 years ago, breast cancer from Dec2017 and ongoing diagnosed in Dec2017, ongoing asthma she was diagnosed with asthma when she was 39 years old, surgery from an unknown date, she had surgery to correct a deviated septum and her asthma got better, she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). On 27Jan2021 she had the first injection. It was about 14 to 16 hours after the injection that she had severe difficulty breathing. Reported she has asthma. She was a cancer survivor, and she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. The difficulty breathing woke her out of her sleep. She had to call the doctor since she is concerned about her second dose which is scheduled for 17Feb2021. The difficulty breathing frightened her, and it was not an immediate reaction, she had the shot at 9:30 am (clarifies she received the injection at 09:20 am) and between 1 to 2 am in the night, she woke up not able to breathe. She could not use her inhaler since she could not really breathe in. She was obviously able to get some air in since she did not pass out. She contacted her doctor and he will send her a prescription to get an Epipen, so she has it on hand when she gets her second dose. Her doctor does not want her to not get the second dose. States she is concerned about other asthmatics receiving the vaccine and wanted to call and report this. She expected it to happen onsite where she received the injection but it did not. Her doctor asked her if she thought it was an asthma attack and she told her doctor that she has not felt like this in 24 years. Treatment/Outcome: She stepped out into the cold to shrink her airways and then was able to use her inhaler. Reports it was not a 2 hour episode thank god, and within 15 minutes she was able to force an inhaler dose in. Everything is fine. She is a breast cancer survivor and cannot use her right side so she had the injection on her left side in her upper shoulder, she has to wait 5 years to be considered cancer free. Her doctor suggested to use her albuterol inhaler for 4 days in advance of getting the second dose of the vaccine.

I had my first COVID vaccine on Sunday, February 28.  I had had sinus problems with a little runny nose the week before...no fever, no chills, normal temperature.  Other than my arm being a little sore, i took two Tylenol the night of the vaccine and had no problems until Tuesday afternoon, March 2, 2021. i felt perfectly Sunday after =noon, all day Monday and Tuesday.  However while shopping at a nearby store as I got to the checkout counter I started having shortness of breath, It was hard for me to walk and I was very shaky.  I have an apple watch so I was able to check my heart rate.  The heart rate was anywhere from 58BPM to 177BPM and all over place in between,  i got in my car, trying to calm myself then called the EMTs.  They took me to hospital to the Emergency Room.  Several tests(see below) were performed.  The final diagnosis was hear palpitations.  They did a COVID test and I did test positive for the Rhino virus.  The doctors didn't know if my incident was related to receive the COVID vaccine and my defibrillator was checked, and a test was run that indicated it wasn't bad enough to activate the defibrillator.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/28/2021,03/02/2021,2,"The following tests were performed in the ER on March 2, 2021: Hematology General Chemistry COVID Test ICD Test",OTH,,Amiodarone 1 per day Entresto 24/26mg 1 in the am and 1 in the pm Carvedilol 6.25mg 1 in the am and 1 in the pm Spironolactone 23mg - 1 in am Furosemide 20mg 1 in am,Cardiomyopathy Sinus,Cardiomyopathy,,,2,03/03/2021,,,Y,Codeine Lipitor Lisinopril Isosorbide Hydralazine Ibuprofen Adhesive Tape

However, last night 2/25/21 mother noticed small red bumps on bilateral legs. This morning 2/26/21 the small red bumps are now also on bilateral arms and some on her neck.

Bumps do not seem to bother patient. Eating and sleeping normal. Denies drainage. Same day appointment scheduled with Dr. on 2/26/21. Dr.'s note after appointment on 2/26/21: 1. Rash and nonspecific skin eruption; Clinical Notes: 7-week-old infant presents to the office for follow-up evaluation of generalized rash which started 48 hours after her vaccine administration. Rash started as a few erythematous lesions and became generalized over the last 24 hours. She is eating well and does not have any vomiting or diarrhea. She has no URI symptoms cough or congestion. She has no fever. She appears well on today's exam. The appearance of rash after 48 hours of vaccination is concerning for a delayed hypersensitivity reaction but unlikely to be IgE mediated response. I would like to obtain consultation with allergy immunology regarding the etiology of the rash. The only booster that she has received is hepatitis B, other vaccines have been given for the first time on 2/23/2021. I will plan to report the rash to VAERS and also seek consultation from National advisory committee web portal via electronic communication. This will help us to figure out if the next set of vaccinations can be given safely. Referral sent To: Allergy/Immunology: Reason:7-week-old infant has generalized erythematous maculopapular rash almost like urticarial vasculitis. Please evaluate for allergic/drug reaction due to vaccination. Dr.'s note after appointment on 3/2/21: Clinical Notes: Patient recently had urticaria for 2 days, occurring 2 days after routine childhood vaccines. She was also feeding on milk-based formula, but the hives seemed to resolve after changing from milk (and also avoiding soy). Mother has a lot of soy in her diet. Still receiving some breast milk also. The reaction was unlikely due to any of the vaccines, and even if the vaccines were related, there were no symptoms to suggest an immediate anaphylactic reaction. Any vaccine can also cause some local swelling or rashes or low-grade fevers due to the normal immune response. Recommend continued vaccination according to the ACIP schedule. SPT for milk was positive and negative for soy, giving some evidence that the hives were due to cow's milk. Recommended to her mother continued avoidance of cow's milk and dairy, including in the mother's diet while still breastfeeding. Also discussed the signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis. Should this occur, use an Auvi-Q and go to the ER. If symptoms persist in 10-15 minutes, then use the second one. Carry 2 at all times. Proper use of Auvi-Q taught and also provided information for milk avoidance and referred to the website. Will f/u in 1 year to repeat SPT for milk.

In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking � tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",,,,,Y,2,,,U,02/05/2021,02/24/2021,19,See Above,PHM,,See below,See below,See below,,,2,03/03/2021,,Y,Y,See below

History is limited due to the patient's current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB >30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.

Headache - light a migraine - it encompassed my whole head and started having low grade fever and severe nausea and abdominal pain and chills and severe body aches and bone achiness. Extreme fatigue. Side that I got the vaccine in, the glands in my neck and under my arm were swollen.  My fever was never only 100 - but 99.6 is where it usually ran and that was unusual for me to have a fever that high. I had had shingles about two years ago that affected my left side. I started to feel like my shingles was coming back. This felt like it was going to go from trunk all the way up to my neck (the shingles) - it didn't. I did have a few areas on my trunk area on that left side that did start - like a burning pain - no itchiness but they did go away. I had  flushing feeling - it was worse than a hot flash and different - it was like my body was extremely hot. My coworkers told me that I looked red as a bright red apple - and I wear makeup and had a face mask on. That continued for about 5 days - face, cheeks, especially below my chin, neck and my trunk - just really red. I have a photo of it. There was no pain to it - just hot flushing feeling. That was different from the shingles. The headache never went away - seven days - had trouble sleeping it was painful. It was almost like I had  flu. I had also increased aura migraines - this aura was squiggly lines instead of usual round. I felt like my chest was tight over the weekend. Like it might be going to my chest - Pulsometer - I check my pulse and my blood oxygen level - it went down to about 92 or 94% and I felt  a little short of breath and that lasted about two days.  I did not check my blood pressure.  The only other thing, like if you have the flu for ten days etc which is what my symptoms lasted- but the fatigue lasted another week past these severe intense reactions.",,,,,,,,,U,01/20/2021,01/21/2021,1,COVID tests - negative - tested twice  a week at work,SEN,,Faraquel 50 mg daily; Clonosopan .5 mg - 1 daily; Estradiol .1 mg patch; Provera - 5 mg; melatonin - 3 mg at night; multi-vitamin,Slight cold in between both vaccines (dr visit - January 4th or 5th).

On 27Jan2021, the patient was administered her first dose of BNT162B2  vaccine and nothing happened during the shot, it was fine. She took a 2 mile walk as she usually does every day and had lunch. About 6 hours after she got the first dose she had projectile vomiting maybe 5 times in a 15 minute period and that was it; it was over. She had no swelling at injection site or anywhere else after getting vaccine. Just the projectile vomiting. Her Primary Care Physician (PCP) does not think she should take the second dose of the vaccine. Her PCP is worried she will have a worse reaction to the second dose. Her Rheumatologist wants her to take the second dose of the vaccine, he can give her Phenergan. The patient reported that she would rather vomit more and still get the second dose. She did not pass out, did not have any life-threatening effects. She is assuming the second dose will be worse, but that is not life-threatening; COVID is life-threatening, serious like including death. She guesses the projectile vomiting could have been from something else; but she went through everything she ate that day and could not see anything really; most of what she had eaten that day she had also eaten the day before. The only thing unusual was one thing of spinach she ate that day; but because she was leaving town that day she threw it out so she cannot go back and check that. She has thrown up in the past when she has gotten bad food, but not quite as much as she did with this projectile vomiting. She takes a lot of supplements so she thought for the next dose of the vaccine she will not take any supplements. She is getting the second dose in the afternoon so she will have already taken her 2 mile walk before getting the second dose. When she takes her 2 mile walk she walks pretty quick, fast, up hills and down hills; and then when she gets home after the second dose she would rest more and not take any more supplements so she can be super aware if anything occurs.

Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.

She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to.

1070963,03/03/2021,CA,33.0,33,,F,,"Our vaccine appointment (first dose) was on 2/28/21 at 1:45pm. We were sat at the station close to the window with my husband on one side and me to his left, near the front door. The prepped vaccine needles were in a blue tray on the table with new packaged needles in the tray as well. Most needles were covered except for one syringe with no needle cover.   The nurse came back from administering the vaccine to an elderly person in their car. She may have discarded something in the trash but I didn?t see her put anything on the table. She introduced herself and I was the first to be vaccinated. I watched her grab the one syringe with the needle exposed. An alarm rang in my head but I figured if something was wrong she would notice and it all happened quickly. She stuck the needle in my left arm and then declared that there was no vaccine in it. It had been empty. When my husband questioned her and asked if there would be any problems if I accidentally got 2 doses she said no, then she said she knew there was no vaccine because she ?didn?t have to push."" When I asked if it was a used needle she said definitely not. She said she always discards the used needles. Her explanation for the incident was that she sometimes has to change out the needle (if it has been exposed) so she may have changed the needle and accidentally pushed the vaccine out. She also mentioned that sometimes the vaccine may leak out.  There was no explanation for why the needle would be uncovered.  We felt somewhat at ease but then got input from other RN?s and decided to call and report to the pharmacy the next day (3/1/21) to be safe since it was an uncovered needle. The pharmacist spoke with the nurse and she and the nurse, along with her husband (who preps some of the vaccines) called us back and explained what may have happened. They said they would follow Medical Center protocol and pay for any lab tests needed. They also said they would look at the medical form of the elderly person who was vaccinated before us to ask if they had any viral infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C. NOTE: If that needle had been previously used it is not certain that it had been used on that specific person.  On 3/2/21 the pharmacist's husband called and said they went over their procedures and had determined that there was no way the needle was previously used/dirty. This determination seemed to be based on taking the word of the nurse instead of trusting me that I had seen the exposed needle lying in the plastic bin of prepped needles. He had a doctor, who was apparently present at the pharmacy, ask about my past medical history, which didn't seem relevant. He told me that from then on I should talk to my doctor and if my doctor had questions the doctor could call them instead of me calling them.   When my husband returned home later on 3/2/21 we tried to get the pharmacist or her husband back on the phone but they did not return our call.     On 3/3/21 we called the pharmacy and spoke with the pharmacist via telephone and asked her if she had reported the incident. She said they had reported it to VAERS. She told us that she had worked with the nurse for years and she was 95% sure the needle had not been previously used. She said if she were in our position she would contact her doctor to see what needed to be done (preventative measures, etc.) and that we should do that, and then have our insurance take care of it rather than having them get involved in paying for any blood work.   We have no interest in making life difficult for anyone. We just want the proper health protocols followed to ensure my safety and to avoid having to shoulder the financial burden of ensuring that safety since the incident occurred at their location and under their care.   We spoke with our physician later on 3/3/21 and gave him the phone number to Pharmacy. We are waiting to hear what his recommendations are for us.",,,,,,,,,U,02/28/2021,02/28/2021,0,N/A,PHM,,N/A,N/A,No,,,2,03/03/2021,,Y,,N/A

The day after vaccination the patient experienced mild subjective fevers, headache, and injection site soreness in the deltoid region without overlying skin changes. Forty-eight hours after administration of the vaccine, the patient developed a mildly pruritic erythematous macular morbilliform eruption on the lower back (Figure 1). Over the course of the following 24 hours, the patient's rash resolved without intervention. Twenty-one days following the initial vaccine, the patient received the second dose of the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, after which he experienced chills, fatigue and myalgias. Forty-eight hours after administration of the second dose, the patient developed a recurrent morbilliform eruption most prominent on the bilateral flanks and flesh colored papules on the right flank with significantly increased pruritus and body surface area involvement.

A 30-year-old male healthcare worker with no past medical history presented for vaccination with the SARS-CoV2, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The day after vaccination the patient experienced mild subjective fevers, headache, and injection site soreness in the deltoid region without overlying skin changes. Forty-eight hours after administration of the vaccine, the patient developed a mildly pruritic erythematous macular morbilliform eruption on the lower back. Over the course of the following 24 hours, the patient's rash resolved without intervention. Twenty-one days following the initial vaccine, the patient received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, after which he experienced chills, fatigue and myalgias. Forty-eight hours after administration of the second dose, the patient developed a recurrent morbilliform eruption most prominent on the bilateral flanks and fleshcolored papules on the right flank with significantly increased pruritus and body surface area involvement. Notably, areas which were previously spared by the first rash including the flanks, proximal extremities and upper back were involved. Of note, regions affected in the first rash (lower back) were similarly affected in the recurrent rash. This rash similarly resolved over the following 24 hours without treatment.  Accordingly, it is possible that the morbilliform rash observed in authors patient was similarly caused by immune activation, as the timing of rash onset closely coincided with vaccine administration. Herein, authors report a case of morbilliform rash secondary to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, like that seen in COVID-19 infection. The presence of similar eruptions in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and in this patient following vaccination with a mRNA vaccine suggests a similar underlying etiology of immune activation leading to the development of a morbilliform rash. An immune-mediated etiology is plausible in our patient's vaccine-related rash, as it was recurrent and notably more extensive following the second dose of the vaccine suggesting a more robust immune response. Thus far, rash has not been reported as an adverse effect in the Pfizer-BioNTech briefing document.; Sender's Comments: Based on the clinical information provided in this spontaneous publication, the company deems there is a reasonable possibility that all the reported events are related to the  Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. For all the reported events there is a plausible temporal association and, for the 'mildly pruritic erythematous macular morbilliform eruption' there is also a positive re-challenge, while chills, fatigue and myalgia, are known aspects of the product safety profile.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn't hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn't secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn't believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn't know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn't know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine.

It was the morning of the 5th day and they had to call an ambulance to take her to the hospital and then she left the hospital. The patient had lost a lot of blood in the ambulance, they said they had never seen so much blood, they could not stop it, they kept giving her towels and the same thing in the hospital, in the emergency room.

The patient informed that she was few days out from getting her second shot and she had stopped the baby aspirin and the fish oil about three weeks ago. The patient informed that she was not going to take second. The patient wanted to know how long she was going to wait, how long she was going to test her antibody and see that she don't have any more antibodies and will go take the other brand vaccine. The patient added she was reporting that she had a terrible nosebleed and wanted to file a safety report. The patient wanted to know that if she choose not to get the 2nd vaccine, because of her worry of having this reaction again, how long would it be before she could get another vaccine; how long can she wait to get the second dose, or can she get a second dose from another manufacturer.

It is not March 4th, 1 day shy of it being a week and I am still experiencing this. I can not taste any food flavor except this taste that I have, it has replaced all food flavors and smells. Whenever I cook something I can smell the scent I taste (only when Its food or Im cooking, I can smell my coconut lotion and body spray just fine). I do not know how to describe it I started describing it as it being an old grease taste but it could be a metallic taste I am not sure, all I know it is a very unpleasant taste. Whenever I brush my teeth, immediately when I put the toothpaste in my mouth i immediately taste the taste again its like it almost heightens it. The taste lingers in my mouth after that as well. I do have to say that I tried a chocolate covered pretzels and m&m's and notices that I can taste sweet stuff but immediately get the taste when I eat regular foods thats are not sweet. I tried to eat waffles one time and the syrup taste was fine but I could not eat sausage because of the taste. This is very frustrating because its disgusting that I would rather not taste anything at all. I am unsure if my taste was ever fully back after having covid I was able to start tasting things but not sure if it was 100% as well as I could smell somethings but  not sure if that was 100%. I talked to some people who thought maybe it is my senses trying to fully come back because they heard about people experiencing weird smells when their senses were coming back but I am unsure I just want to not deal with this anymore.

The patient's medical history included hypothryroidism from an unknown date. Patient's height used to be five foot three with weight: between 140 to 150 pounds, usually around 145 pounds. Concomitant medications included Magnesium Malate at 1000mg and at 200mg (lot number: X002OISTE1 and expiration date: Aug2023). She got Magnesium the heart doctor told her to get. She stopped taking it on 22Jan2021, two days after the first episode on the 20Jan2021. Patient previously had problems with another thyroid drug, it was a natural thyroid medication called NP THYROID and she had palpitations on that one. The drug was not as standardized because it is natural thyroid. She started it in 2019 and took for a year and half. She was on a higher dose, 30mg originally and dropped down to 15mg or .25gram because it was ""too much."" The pharmacy sent a notice out that a dosage was too high in May or Jun. Then in Sep the dosage was too low. She asked pharmacy about the lot number and they said they didn't put it on there. She got it from (Pharmacy name withheld). RX number: 1677890-07298. Manufacturer: (Company name withheld). The dose amount had dropped, and she wasn't getting enough of the drug and her TSH had gone very high. That was causing the palpitations. Then she was switched to levothyroxine sodium.  On 20Jan2021, patient experienced heart palpitations. It was reported that at the beginning of Jan2021 (also reported as 20Jan2021), patient decided on her own to take levothyroxine sodium sublingually and she experienced heart palpitations. Patient confirmed that this was not prescribed to be taken sublingually. Patient asked if taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually increase its potency. Also, on 20Jan2021, she received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Her thyroid levels taken this past Friday (29Jan2021) were normal. Patient asked if taking the Covid vaccine with levothyroxine sodium cause palpitations. She wanted to know if there is data on taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually. She wanted to know if it has more of an effect and wondered if taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually might have effected it. She doubts if Pfizer has studied it sublingually, but would that have increased the potency of the levothyroxine sodium? Maybe she got more than she was getting before. On 20Jan2021 she received Pfizer's COVID19 Vaccine. She started having palpitations that night and she was not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with it. The palpitations are ongoing. Some days they get worse and other days they are ok. She thought she was low on levothyroxine sodium, so she started taking a little more. She knew she was supposed to call the doctor.  The day after she got palpitations, she started increasing the thyroid medication and it didn't seem to help. Over- the- counter Zinc, Magnesium, and Potassium helped. Zinc seemed to have most effect at trying to reduce them. It was reported that patient took Zinc 30 Orotate (lot number: 210606, expiration date: Nov2020). She took it on three occasions when she had it bad. Within a few hours after she took it the palpitations calmed down. Patient also took Potassium (lot number: 8BO3217 and expiration: Mar2003). She has only taken it twice since the palpitations.  She doesn't take those normally except for the Magnesium. She went to the doctor yesterday, but she didn't see the doctor and only saw the nurse. She underwent thyroid test on Friday, 29Jan2021 and it was within range. The TSH was not high, meaning she was getting the correct amount. She doesn't know how quickly taking the half thyroid pill would have effected it at that point. Supposedly she is within range, but still was having palpitations. Some days are really bad and other days not so bad. The levothyroxine sodium is the same prescription bottle. She just switched from taking it orally to sublingual. She took it orally for the first several months and then switched to sublingual, for both, she would take half of the tablet in the morning and half at night because she was so reactive to medication. She was concerned if she should get the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine because ""you never know."" The patient further reported that she saw the cardiologist in the fall, and he did EKG and didn't find anything unusual. She is going to go see him again tomorrow because her other doctor said if the heart palpitations are bad enough, she needs to go to the ER and get EKG. She just had EKG in the fall. She knows it was a reaction to something. As soon as she started getting more thyroid medication in her, it went away.

Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason's she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn't feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria).

Patient stated that major headache went in on a ""Wednesday"". Her husband and her did, and went through vaccination portal, to get an appointment, appointments were very trying, as they were to do all healthcare providers first, which is understandable, and then the vaccine. They were trying to make it available for teachers, as they are going back to school, in school learning in March, so all teachers were the next step and then also anyone over 65 was able to go on the portal with the state to get an appointment to go and get a vaccination. She and husband  have a daughter who was a teacher, and she said to go on the portal to get the shot, and they said they didn't have access to it, so she went on the site, and they got it in on 27Jan2021.

She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask ""what day is it?"" Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5'3'', she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister's primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.

The maternal past medications included Metrogel (metronidazole) used for bacterial vaginosis.  The maternal obstetrical history included two previous pregnancies with one full term live birth, and one spontaneous abortion. The neonate's mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The neonate's mother had no relevant maternal and paternal medical history with MCM. The neonate's mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The maternal last menstrual period (LMP) date was on 13-Apr-2020, the estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 18-Jan-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was not reported. The type of pregnancy was singleton.  On 06-Jul-2020, first trimester screen revealed no MCMs.  On 27-Jul-2020, second trimester screen revealed increased risk of Down syndrome, but no MCM was noted.

After administration, was asked to pull forward and park in a spot on the right in order to sit for his required 15 minutes post-administration. became unresponsive as he was attempting to park and continue to turn the wheel causing him to drive in a U shape into a rock covered median. The SUV was able to clear the median and the car stopped at the APEX. When I saw the car heading towards the median, I started to head toward the site safely. I approached the car slowly asking him to stop. When I did not receive a response, I knew something was wrong. Once I felt the car was safe to approach, I ran to assist the patient. The patient was barely able to communicate but did say he was dizzy.  15 seconds later he was unable to communicate, I called a second pharmacist  to run over with an epi pen just in case (this was NOT administered). I immediately called 911 at 2:21 pm. reached into the vehicle and got the vehicle into park, while I assessed his airway, breathing, and pulse from a seated position. The patient began to seize. I continued to hold the patient from outside of the vehicle to maintain the patient's airway and keep him from hurting himself on the steering wheel. The patient regained consciousness approximately 3 minutes later with no memory of what happened. EMS arrived on scene about 2 minutes after he regained the ability to communicate. While EMS assessed the patient, and I reached out to  and division one store management per SOP. EMS determined that the patient had a seizure and was able to go home if they wanted. The father moved into the driver seat. We monitored the patient for 30 minutes and allowed them to leave. We followed up with the patient via phone 2 hours later with no concerns noted.
