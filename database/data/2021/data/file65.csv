I woke up Thursday morning with a left swollen labia minora and a stinging sharp pain wiping after urination, blood spots on TP. I took flash photos to see what it looked like at the entrance of my vagina. I saw a cluster of small, bleeding, open wound sores, looked like speckles of blood. I saw a doctor at Health Services the next morning and was told it looks like I have herpes. I did a viral culture swab for hsv. I had just tested negative for a full panel std test (minus hsv) in February, so we did not redo it. Monday, I got the call, my doctor said the results were negative and most likely a false negative, she said she is sure I have herpes. Tuesday, the next day I go into health services again to get a second opinion from another doctor and get re-swabbed. The second doctor agreed it looks just like herpes and she doesn't know what else it could be. We do another viral culture swab and she confirmed that she picked up fluid from the sores this time. I was also swabbed for gonorrhea and chlamydia and redid the full panel std blood test from February. The results all come back negative, and the doctor says she doesn't know what else it could be besides herpes. I am fed up with no answers and go to an urgent care. The doctor does not know what my lesions could be from. We did another viral culture swab that tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia and hsv. She offered pills to treat chancroid just in case and I took them thinking it was risk free. By the time I got home I was throwing up for a couple hours. My results come back negative. My second doctor calls me and says she is confident I could have syphilis (even though the sores were the most pain I've ever experienced). I came in to give blood for syphilis and hsv testing. Both came back negative, but the doctor was telling me I should still go somewhere for syphilis treatment (a shot I think?). I was even more frustrated.  I sought out an OBGYN center that specializes in ulcers. The amazing doctor agreed with me that I do not have any std's and that my ulcers were a result of the vaccine.

The tingling in my arms went from my feet all the way up to my waist. The sensation was definitely more intense than what I experienced after the first shot. About 1 hour after the tingling started, I checked my fever and had 100.5 F. The fever lasted 6 hours along with the tingling/numbness.

On 27Jan2021, she broke out in a rash on her right lower arm between the elbow and wrist. She thought it was an allergy. When she thought it was more than that she went to the doctor. Diagnosed on 29Jan2021 with shingles. She was immediately put on the protocol of Gabapentin and Valtrex, the antiviral.  It got worse. She gave it one more day and yesterday she went to the doctor. She has a bacterial infection on top of shingles. She is on the second day of antibiotic. Her question is her second Pfizer COVID19 shot is scheduled for 10Feb2021. Should she take it? Is it safe to do that? She also wanted to report it so it would be part of the database in case other people break out. She wasn't allowed to take the Shingles vaccines because the doctors did not want her to because of her compromised system. She has not had Shingles vaccine, but she did have chickenpox when she was younger. The rash is raging and like a flesh eating monster. It is bacterial and shingles.

States that she did have rotator cuff surgery in 2013, and that's kind of what the pain feels like now.

Clarifies that she was born with the disability with her right hand and a cyst, they just didn't find the cyst until she was 39 and that's when she had the surgery. States that it scares her because she only has the use of one arm already. She had no problem with the medication in the vaccine either time. States that the second time she got the vaccine, she knew that the nurse was putting it in the wrong spot because it hurt so bad, like so bad that she wanted to slap her. States that the pain is nowhere near like it was on Monday, but she didn't know who to call. She gives herself allergy shots, so she knows how to give herself injections. States that the vaccine was perfect, she had no side effects from that. The first shot, she didn't even know that she had gotten a shot. States that yesterday her arm didn't feel as bad as it does today. It's more aggravating. Again, states that the pain was like what she had after her rotator cuff surgery.

Outcome of the events rash on her chest, arms and midriff developed (rash), itchy was not recovered, measles outcome was unknown, headache and a sore arm outcome was recovered.  The patient received the second dose on 27 MAR 2021. She experienced a headache and a sore arm for day and a half after the vaccine. Then last week she also had a headache for two days in a row, but that could be due to the change in the weather, she doesn't know what that is. She said that a week and a half ago a rash, a measles like rash on her chest, arms and midriff developed. She wasn't sure if it was because she was working outside, or related to the vaccine. She did find a couple of ticks on her. She called the local farm bureau and they said no, it wasn't from the ticks because the ticks would of burrowed their head into the skin. It was probably because she was outside. The patient has been taking Benadryl do to the fact that she has been outside and she has been very itchy. Everything is in bloom right now, but she was wearing long pants and long sleeves with gloves. The patient's itching is horrible. The patient night before up all night took Benadryl. She got a cream her husband use to used for eczema, it was an anti-itch cream, and she also used Aveeno eczema cream that has calamine lotion in it. The patient hasn't gone and seen her doctor yet because she felt better two days later and thought it was subsiding. The patient might be because she takes a shower and then she is alright for a couple of hours because of all the creams she is using. The last night she was up till 3 am because of the itching. She stated that she knows you are not suppose to take other peoples medication but she had Prednisone 10 mg in the house, from her husband when he would have eczema flare ups, and she took that at 3 in the morning. She said that her doctor thought there has been too much time from when she got the vaccine for it to be related so she googled and it said that people can get a measles like rash, and read something about being on their toes, but hers wasn't on her toes. Her rash was just her chest, arm, part of her legs and midriff. She stated that she is nervous, and she lost her husband a year ago on 28 APR and she doesn't know, if it is just nerves/stress or if it due to the reaction. The patient when she went to go get the vaccine they had asked her if she ever had reaction to a vaccine and she said a year ago when she had the pneumonia shot, she got cellulitis 2 inches above and 2 inches below the injection site. Her doctor thought it was cellulitis and she had to take antibiotics for a week. She stated that she had to wait longer then the normal 15 minutes because of her previous reaction so they made he wait for 30 mins when she got the covid vaccine. The first shot did not hurt at all. She asked that because she said that the second vaccine hurt immediately, it was discomforting. She thought she hit a nerve. She said it was like someone ran a nail down all the way down to her elbow. She doesn't know if she hit a nerve or what, but it was very painful. Clarified her headache started Sunday night after the vaccine and went away Monday. The patient thought the rash might be shingles, but then she was like no, that is only suppose to be on one side of a body. She stated that she needs to get the new shingles shot because the one that she had years ago isn't good anymore. She hasn't had new shingles immunization yet because she had to get the COVID shot. She doesn't know if the itching started because she saw the ticks or not but it started immediately. She states that she got the ticks off of her and shook her hair out. She states that she took Benadryl, she didn't have the fast acting Benadryl she had the 24 hour relief Benadryl. She went to the store and got fast acting Benadryl and has been taking them ever since Monday. She took Benadryl 25mg two only at night. Lot S200513 exp. May 2023.

A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn't have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn't have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn't even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can't really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event 'she was just tired' was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021.

Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, bleeding ulcer and helicobacter pylori infection both from 15Feb2021, and ongoing tumor on his heart. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 in the left arm on 26Feb2021 (lot number: EN6203) for COVID-19 immunisation. Right before he had his first shot, he was in the hospital on 15Feb2021 with a bleeding ulcer and a helicobacter pylori infection. He had been in the hospital and isn't sure what all they gave him then. The patient started lisinopril 4 or 5 years ago when he was diagnosed with high blood pressure. His blood pressure was under control with the lisinopril but the patient is no longer on it. The patient's father had a stroke when he was 42 but he had high blood pressure and didn't get it treated. The patient got up around 07:00 in the morning on 27Mar2021. The patient's wife got up at 08:30 when she realized something was wrong. The patient said when he got up around 07:00, he experienced his right side being numb. The patient went to the emergency room and was treated there. He had a stroke. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 to 30Mar2021. The patient's wife doesn't know if it has anything to do with the shot. After his stroke, they put him on ""carvilo"". When the patient was in the hospital for the stroke, they found other issues. He has a tumor in his heart that's a pretty good size and the doctor said it had been there for awhile. So, they put her husband on ""carvilo"" to help with his blood pressure and his heart. She doesn't think the tumor had anything to do with the shot because the doctor did say the size of the tumor was as big as it was because it had been there a while. They found the tumor while trying to find out why he had the stroke. They still haven't found a reason as to why he had the stroke. The tumor is on the right side of his heart and they said they didn't think that had anything to do with the stroke. The tumor was found on 28Mar2021. They did an MRI and a CT scan on his head when he was in the emergency room (ER) on 27Mar2021. They also did an ultrasound on his heart, chest, and abdomen.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: leg is swollen in 2021, X-ray: nothing showed up in 2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of losing strength in his right leg, muscle pain, joint pain.  The course of events was as follows:  Around 21 Mar2021 or 22Mar2021, he had problems with his leg. Patient was experiencing muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg. Patient stated that was a problem. Patient had an MRI and X-ray that looked to see what the problem was. Patient received second dose on 14Apr2021.

He called the doctor and told them something was wrong with his leg, they took an x-ray and nothing showed up. They did an MRI and all it shows was that his leg was swollen, no bones or nothing is broken. He was looking at Pfizer paperwork that a facility gave him and the two of symptoms are on there, so this problem was related to the vaccine. He never hurt his right leg, never had a problem until he got this shot. He was losing all his strength in his right leg, all the pain.

The first muscle relaxer they gave him, the 10mg one, he took it that day, it knocked him out. Caller states when he saw his doctor, he said he can not take that one while he works, he will take it at night time, so that is why the doctor gave him the other muscle relaxer, Baclofen, to take while he worked during the day.

Patient had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine on 09Apr2021 and gradually her arm hurt, she had hot sweats, she felt dizzy, was shaky, had nausea, and had body pain. The one thing she is concerned about was she had pain in her back where her lungs are and she was having problems breathing. She has a little bit of that still. She has also been out of it. Her breathing still almost feels labored, and this past weekend she thought she would go to the emergency room. Her main concern is this awful pain in her back while she was having problems breathing and getting enough oxygen. She felt weak, dizzy, and shaky. She got scared. She has been sick, she had cancer a long time ago. What scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen. The pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs. It goes directly from the front to the back. On Monday it started feeling better. Today it is so much better. She will feel like she is not getting enough oxygen or giving a full breath and then this in her back. She remembers having pneumonia years ago and having pain in her lungs. That's why she knows the pain is in the back of her lungs. She has to say she is a smoker. She slowed down and couldn't smoke this week or during that. She kind of quit, that's her reality now. The pain comes and goes throughout the day but it is not as bad. She didn't have this shortness of breath and other things until a couple days after she got the vaccine. It gradually came up on her. She was not having trouble breathing, it was more slightly labored. It was not profound, just there. Sometimes when she is speaking after a while she gets tired and will have to take a moment and take a deep breath. It is so much better. She called her primary care physician and was anxious, and all he said was she would feel effects for 2 weeks. He wasn't very helpful. Her arm hurt the day that she had the shot. Even today there are little bits of pain but very light. 09Apr2021 through 11Apr2021 was when everything really hit. It was hard to lift up her arm. It was a little pain, it was no big deal. She would have the AC on and blast it when she had the hot and cold sweats. She was using napkins because she was sweating profusely. It felt like she obviously had a reaction to the vaccine. It's normal she guesses. She didn't expect it for the first dose. The 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th it was really bad. Her whole body was sweating and would get wet. She'd be hot and then cold. She was anxious because she was having problems breathing. She still gets a little bit of hot and cold sweats, but nothing compared to what she went through. As the days go on she is slowly getting better. She was dizzy not just during the day, at night she couldn't sleep because of it. She has gradually gotten better. Yesterday she tried to do some gardening but felt so weak she had to come back inside. When she gets up she feels weak and a little bit of lack of air. She has labored breathing. She was real itchy. The shakiness, dizziness, and anxiety all came on and were horrible. She doesn't know if the nausea was because she couldn't eat and had to take her regular medication. It was very light nausea. She had flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders. Her headache was major too during all of this. The headache is something that comes and goes still. It is a weird kind of headache. She had a fever and got like flu all over body pain. She doesn't know how to explain how she felt out of it. She doesn't know if it was the fact she was so sick. She had a feeling of did she do that. She couldn't make decisions. She would need to take the garbage out and go back to the garbage and think what did she come here for. Her mental status was also affected. The weakness gradually got really bad, and she still hasn't recovered from it. She still feels weak and tired when trying to do things. She was tired the day after she got the vaccine. The first day she thought it was nothing and she was fine. Gradually it got real bad when she was sick. She didn't feel that flu-ish feeling but was weak and tired. She got dizzy and she had the brain fog thing. She was having really bad headaches during the same time. The weakness and tiredness go hand in hand. She takes a mineral for her thoracic spine, but she takes that more for elderly arthritis. She doesn't have any conditions that she thinks played a role. She has been feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen. Took Tylenol for her fever. Mentioned fever would go away and come back. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 102, 99 and 100.1 (unit unspecified) all on unspecified dates.

This literature report from a physician reporting same event under the same suspect product for 9 patients. This is one of 9 reports.  Many pregnant persons are receiving messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines, but data are limited on their safety in pregnancy. Method: From 14Dec2020, to 28Feb2021, authors used data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and other data to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. Result: A total of 35,691 participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases). Conclusions: Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.

The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), in left arm on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 59-year-old, Lot number: ER2613) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced left arm soreness and slept for 3 days on 25Mar2021.

The patient did not develop adverse events prior vaccinations. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect was none. Caller was a consumer, enquired asking what she was supposed to do with this rash. Caller reports that she received her second vaccine dose on 15Apr2021 and 4 hours after getting her vaccination she became an ""itchy hurting mess"" on 19Apr2021. Her first vaccine dose was reportedly 3 weeks prior to her second. She reports that she was experiencing an awful rash described as ""a wild rash on my chest, bright red itchy angry"" on 19Apr2021. Caller reports that she has seen her healthcare professional twice her Dermatologist three times and her Psychiatrist twice with no improvement or guidance. Caller states ""Pfizer was the one who made it they should know what do to about the side effects"". Caller reports that she has tried numerous over the counter products and medicines to help with her rash, but nothing has helped. Caller reports that she has asked her doctor to give her a cortisone shot and was refused because it may interfere with the vaccine. Caller became audibly upset asking loudly, ""what am I supposed to do?!"" and ""what happens to me"" reporting that people get the shot, and they are ""thrown to the wind"" and no one knows what to do for me. Caller asks, ""How many people total have had adverse reactions after getting the vaccine."" During this call, caller threatened to go to the News and then stated, ""I don't know what to do I may have to kill myself"". Caller made no additional statements of harm to herself and no need to direct to suicide hotline was necessary. Caller was a consumer, asking ""how do I get help to pay for the medicines I have had to use after getting the vaccine."" Caller was a consumer, asking ""what would be a contraindication to getting the vaccine."" Caller was a consumer, asking, ""did you have anyone with autoimmune problems get the vaccine"". Caller reports that she has fibromyalgia, lupus Psoriasis and says, I have an autoimmune disease, I am not immunosuppressed. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has reported adverse events. There was no prescriber. The doctor's on site need more training. She should have never been allowed to have the vaccine. She had a swollen left eye and a rash around left eye when she went in and the doctor said it was ok. She wanted to know if there was any directive on who should not get the vaccine. Small rash around left eye started to spread. The rash was there before. It was hard to comb out what happened when. Rash was very itchy and very painful. Nobody knows what it was. She has been to 6 doctors. This was the second dose that she started having the issues with the rash. She later stated she had arm pain and slept for 3 days after the first dose. She has a growth that was there previous on the upper left arm and during the second injection, she thinks it was given a little higher in the shoulder, closer to where that growth was. She was not sure that one was given in the muscle. The Effexor was increased at first due to titration up to full capacity or dose. Then titration down because of side effects and then titration down due to rash. She stated it was the same rash that we are talking about. It was in a pharmacy vial with no lot or expiration. If she ever had a regular vial it was thrown away. There were different bottles with different doses and different lots and expirations. She no longer has any of the bottles to provide a lot or expiration. She has the 150mg, count size was 90 tablets. This was the one she was taking when she was taking the shot. It was in a Pharmacy vial. Her current dose was 75 mg once daily. That was in a pharmacy vial with no lot or expiration. She has pictures of the rash and it is bright red and very angry. They did a biopsy of chest on 27Apr2021, and the results are not back yet. She went to dermatologist for the third time on 27Apr2021. For the first one, she only slept for 3 days and only had arm pain. She later stated she might have slept for 3,4 or 5 days, she does not remember. ER or physician's office required. Physician visits 16Apr2021, saw a dermatologist at withheld Dermatology, that she doesn't remember his name. He was a 50-year-old male doctor. Creams, ointments and later stated Hydrocortisone 1%. She has a bag full of creams and ointments. and was lucky she remembers what goes on what parts. Some do not go on face or near eye. This was the only one that went near her eye. Then on 20Apr2021, she saw Dr. at the same group with the same address and phone as last one. She does not remember what was given when. Maybe 2.5% cream was given then, but then said no, that was not during that visit. She does not remember when was given what. They just keep having her buy more lotion and buy more stuff. They have helped a little bit. Something inside of her body was causing it. The rash just keeps getting worse and they are a band aid, and nothing was getting rid of it. She does not wish to provide the names of those creams and ointments and did not wish to provide dose, lot, or expiration for any. She said they are not the issue. She then saw the same 50-year-old bald male, not Dr. the other guy, on 27Apr2021, she got a biopsy on her chest and does not have results. He prescribed a new cream. She also saw Dr., primary care physician, 27Apr2021. She said she believes it was because of the vaccine but she did not want to give cortisone or prednisone because it might negate the vaccine. She directly faults Pfizer with her doctor not knowing what they could and could not use. She saw Dr. Psychiatrist, on 27Apr2021. She had already lowered her Effexor by phone. No additional treatment during that visit. She lowered the dosage on 22Apr2021 from 150 mg to 75 mg now. That doctor said she does not know if it was from the Effexor or the shot. The dermatologist does not know if it was from Psoriasis or the vaccine because the rash got worse in sun. Usually psoriasis gets better in the sun. Caller states she has done three reports so far and no one can help her. Says every idea they give her was one she has already done or can't do. States nobody knows why she has this rash, nor do they know what to do. She has been sleeping all day, every day, since 15Apr2021. She has lost 2 weeks of her life. She also wanted to know if Pfizer recommends giving the vaccine with autoimmune problems. She has not read anything about that. She lastly stated that the rash started in her upper arm and was now spreading to her lower right arm. This started 2 days ago (25Apr2021). Was there any clearing house for people with problems. She read there are like 400 people who have problems after the four hours. They did not count her and there are a probably a million other people. There was no specific information on those 400 people, and it was just a report. She did not have any further details to provide. Call handler asks caller if she was wanting to do a follow up report from the one this morning and if she has any new symptoms. The caller states that her rash has gotten worse. She states it was better in the morning, worse at night, better in the morning, worse at night. States her rash was a scratchy, hurty mess. She wants to know what to do about her rash. Caller says that the doctor won't give her steroid medications for the rash because she had the vaccine recently. Caller goes on about how she needs to speak with the people who developed the vaccine. States how can Pfizer just be out there telling everyone to get the vaccine, get the vaccine, get the vaccine; but then could not help them when they have a reaction. Caller randomly says that she has read about shingles after the vaccine. States why do they put polyethylene glycol in things if they know some people are allergic? Caller did not specify that this was in the vaccine, she just stated it as things. Call handler asks caller if she was allergic to polyethylene glycol? Caller yells she doesn't know. States her rash itches and hurts and was driving her nuts. Again says better in the morning, worse at night, better in the morning, worse at night. The patient was tired and sleepy on 15Apr2021. No investigation assessment. The patient underwent lab test and procedure which included biopsy: Results are not back yet on 27Apr2021. The outcome of the events tired and sleepy was not recovered, recovering for the event rash, itchy and unknown for the other event.

They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60.

A 75-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), dose 2 via unknown route of administration on 03Apr2021 (Lot Number: ER8729, Expiry date: Jul 2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was breast cancer. The patient historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on (LOT:EJ1686 Expiration: 31MAR2021) on 13 Mar 2021  for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no family history. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced chills on 04Apr2021, sore left arm on 13Apr2021, Rash on the left side of her face; itchy; face felt like it was hot on Apr2021, chills on her left side from her foot to her neck: on 17Apr2021, Tiredness on an unknown date and tightness in her left leg that felt like a tunicate was left on 17Apr2021, wasn't feeling herself Apr2021. The patient stated she wanted to send pictures of her rash on her face that her dermatologist diagnosed last Tuesday as a Covid Vaccine side effect. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 and the second dose on 03Apr2021. They were both done at (withheld). With the first, she had no side effects, other than a sore left arm. The second she had a sore arm and a couple of chills at first. Then two weeks post second vaccination she wasn't feeling herself, and she went to see a primary about that, but that wasn't a definite that it was side effects from the vaccine. Then, the following week on a Thursday she got a rash about the same time but it was getting itchy so she decided someone should look at it. At first she thought it was from her mask, but it was only on the left side of her face. Caller states she wrote a message to her doctor about not feeling well but she didn't connect all of the other symptoms. She went to her primary for the chills on her left side from her foot to her neck and just not feeling like herself. She had a tightness in her left leg that felt like a tunicate was left on. Her face felt like it was hot. States it was really very weird and she was very tired. The tiredness comes and goes. States she was doing interviews yesterday for a long time, virtual interviews and by 12 noon she felt so tired and took a nap and felt out of sorts. She Didn't show her the rash because she thought it was just from her mask and she wasn't a dermatologist. Didn't mention it to her primary. States she tried to cancel the appointment but said she needed to come see her anyway. Thursday she had another appointment so she called the dermatologist when it started to itch and she said to the office, should she be worried. At first, said no time, and reported to doctor and fit her in at 13:30 and she looked at it and said it is really impressive for being 2 weeks old and thinks it is Covid vaccine related. Didn't know if she should report it or not. Maybe it is something. Was thinking the Covid rash was extensive. She still has the tiredness. It reminds her of the tiredness she had after radiation for breast cancer. States it wasn't during the radiation, but 4-5 weeks later and lasted about a month. States the tiredness is not from a lack of sleep, it is like a veil comes over her. States if she has taken 10 naps in her whole life, that is a lot for her and that didn't help. Treatment: Gel for the Rash; states for her leg issue the doctor ordered an MRI to rule out a back or disc problem. States she didn't put it together, one said it might be and another side not sure. At first she was offered the Moderna and she changed when they offered the Pfizer, because of the breast issues from the Moderna. Curious to see at some point if point if other people are experiencing rashes on their faces. Caller states she didn't know what type of rash was common, she assumed it was more of a bodily rash. Tetanus back in the Fall or maybe July thinks last July, she had GI stuff and her physician wasn't particularly believing it was from that. The event tiredness wsa assessed as serious (Medically significant), and tightness in her left leg that felt like a tunicate was left considered serious (Disability). The all other events were assessed as non-serious. The patient had physicians room visit (PCP and dermatologist) and not had emergency room visit. The causality assessment was unknown for all events.

1299370,05/08/2021,MD,,,,F,,"Anaphylaxis After the Covid-19 Vaccine; This is a literature report.   Authors reported a case of the first patient at the (Hospital), who had immediate anaphylaxis after administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. Authors highlighted that the patient never had an episode of anaphylaxis previously and had nonreactive skin testing for polyethylene glycol, polysorbatecontaining vaccines, as well as the Covid-19 vaccine itself. Importantly, she had an underlying condition that predisposed her to non-IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. The case is a 34-year-old female healthcare professional, who presented to the Allergy and Immunology clinic for evaluation of an anaphylaxis event that occurred after administration of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The patient had negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests 109 and 39 days before immunization. She noted in the interview to have been subjectively overheated while standing in line waiting to receive the first dose of the vaccine. Within 3 min of vaccine administration, she developed flushing, urticaria on her extremities and face, generalized pruritus, tongue swelling, nausea, light-headedness, racing pulse, and shortness of breath with absence of wheezing. Emergency medical personnel responded and administered intramuscular epinephrine and diphenhydramine. She noted substantial relief within minutes of administration of these medicines. The patient was transported to the emergency department for monitoring and had no further reaction. After discharge, she noted erythema and hives around the site of injection, which were nearly resolved by the time of our evaluation 2 days later. Two years earlier, she noted a large hive at the site of injection that took days to resolve after receiving preservative free quadrivalent influenza vaccine, Fluarix (GlaxoSmithKline) without associated systemic symptoms. Two months before the anaphylaxis event, she received Afluria (Seqirus), quadrivalent preservative-free influenza vaccine. Again, she noted a large local hive at the site of injection without a systemic reaction. She also described a history of childhood asthma and eczema but had never had an episode of anaphylaxis. She lastly described a greater than 10-year history of inducible episodes of pruritus, swelling, and hives that were most notable at times of sweating. She noted an inability to take warm showers as well as limitations with exercise due to pruritus and hives in what was suspicious for cholinergic urticaria. Authors performed an examination, laboratory studies, and several procedures for evaluating her anaphylaxis episode. Laboratory evaluation showed elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) (1.27 mg/dL) 2 days following immunization, negative chronic urticaria (CU) index (4.3), and IgE levels (74.98 IU/mL) within the reference range. Dermatographism was not present. Skin examination revealed no skin findings of cutaneous mastocytosis. Serum tryptase was 4.7 ug/L and 5.4 ug/L checked 7 and 26 days, respectively, after the event and was within reference range; tryptase was not checked before or during the event. The tryptase alpha/beta 1 (TPSAB1) copy number variation test did not reveal tandem duplication(s) of TPSAB1 by allele-specific PCR. Prick puncture skin testing for polyethylene glycol, Prevnar 23 (Merck), and Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 (Pfizer) was negative. She scored 11 of 21 on the cholinergic urticaria disease severity standardized scale, suggesting moderate level of the disease. Authors further confirmed cholinergic urticaria via exercise provocation challenge guided by a standardized protocol. Based on the history and findings, her systemic reaction after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine was most consistent with anaphylaxis from a severe episode of cholinergic urticaria. Cholinergic urticaria has a known association with anaphylaxis although most people usually have only cutaneous symptoms. Because of her newly diagnosed cholinergic urticaria and recent anaphylaxis episode, authors recommended she carry an epinephrine auto-injector. Authors also recommended non-sedating antihistamine therapy for prevention of urticaria during bathing and exercise once she was done breastfeeding. Lastly, authors recommended all vaccines including the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine be administered under supervision in a cool room without excessive clothing. The protection data after a single dose of the vaccine was unclear at the time so administering a single dose was not considered ideal. Based on the evaluation and the patient's increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure, she, after informed decision making, accepted a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. Authors recommended against pre-medications since they were able perform the challenge in a cool room and confirm that she was not sweating or overheating. Authors also did not want to mask an IgE-mediated reaction in the event of false-negative skin testing. In addition, the patient did not want to use any antihistamines as her infant was not weaned and still breastfeeding. She tolerated her second dose, without premedication, exhibiting only transient, mild nausea and a sense of warmth, but without any objective findings. Vaccines have an overall excellent safety profile; this includes data from Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials. Authors highlighted that the patient showed propensity for allergic reactions even before administration of the Covid-19 vaccine based on her localized reaction to the influenza vaccines and her history of cholinergic urticaria. It was important for them to evaluate whether IgE-mediated anaphylaxis might underlie her case. Authors showed that the patient had nonreactive skin testing with both 1:1 epicutaneous and 1:100 and 1:10 intradermal Covid-19 vaccine and drugs containing polysorbate 80. However, more data are needed to determine skin testing's role in predicting IgE-mediated Covid-19 vaccine allergy. Likewise, evaluation of mast cell activation in addition to IgE-mediated allergy needs to be considered after any episode of anaphylaxis or potentially severe cutaneous reaction to Covid-19 vaccinations. Evaluations should include the evaluation of inducible urticaria disorders, hereditary alpha tryptasemia, mastocytosis, and idiopathic mast cell activation disorders. Assuming that immediate Covid-19 vaccine reactions correlate to an IgE-mediated allergy ignores other non-contraindicating etiologies and potentially erroneously denies patients the benefit of immunization. Thus, the general public should be aware of immune conditions that may place a person at risk of anaphylaxis, but that these may not be specific to the Covid-19 vaccine. Distinctly, CDC guidance notes ""If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting a shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, you should not get a second shot of that vaccine, even if your allergic reaction was not severe enough to require emergency care."" The fact that the patient with a common mast cell disorder was able to safely receive the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine following anaphylaxis suggests that anaphylaxis may not represent an absolute contraindication but validates the recommendation that these cases should be evaluated by an allergist and an immunologist for directed care and not be categorically denied the Covid-19 vaccine.

Method: From 14Dec2020, to 28Feb2021, authors used data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and other data to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. Result: A total of 35,691 participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester).

Also was getting muscle and joint soreness, and later that started getting extreme cramping in my leg calf muscles while sitting on the couch.  I then had to stand up for 5-10 minutes, or walk around a little and then after sitting the extreme cramping would begin again so I would have to stand up again.  That went on all day.  When laying down that night the cramping would subside enough to sleep a little on and off during the night.  The calf muscle cramping started to gradually subside, but took about 17 days to go completely away.  The day after the vaccine when my legs were cramping I was extremely worried about possible leg clots since I had never had extreme leg cramping like that my entire life, and I was drinking plenty of water like the nurse recommended.

This swelling under the eye did not physically connect to the swelling of the eyelid and area above the eyelid.  On May 7, I went to see the doctor first thing in the morning.  She said it was an infection in the eyelid and prescribed an antibiotic.  I took an antibiotic right away and then again in the evening.

Patient came in and received the vaccine under the DOB year 2000 instead of the actual DOB year 2004. Moderna guidelines suggest patients receive the vaccine ages 18 & up.  The mistake was caught after the vaccine was administered, realizing that the patient was 17 years old instead of 18.   Per mother of the patient, an email was sent to her by the school board that suggested patients receive the moderna vaccine for patients 16 & up, which is why she didn't question it to begin with.   As per admin information was verified and patient confirmed. As per nurse administrating the vaccine the dob was verified again and the patient confirmed.  When the patient headed for the 2nd dose appointment, she told the admin staff that the birthday for her daughter was incorrect and the issue was escalated to the admin site lead in which she realized that the patient's correct DOB would indicate that the patient is 17 instead of 18.   Pt?s mom was informed of the issue and information. Per Dr, it was suggested that patient is eligible to receive the 2nd dose of moderna.

Subsequent CTA showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and the right frontoparietal cortical veins as well has nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus.

I had a long discussion with multiple sisters about the risks of anticoagulation with argatroban given the IPH but the necessity given the cerebral venous thrombosis.

Today, third day after vaccine, pain seems to be letting up a little bit. Correspondingly, the inflammation at the injection site is beginning to go down as of third day. The injection site is still tender, itchy and slightly red, and the size of the hard lump is down to about the size of a robin's egg. For the first two days the injection site was warm to the touch, quite sore and quite swollen -- what one might call a ""goose egg"" although not actually as big as an actual goose egg. Having had much experience with bee stings growing up, I would compare the condition of the injection site to that of a bee sting reaction. But the lower back pain is the worst I've ever experienced, more intense than the normal strain from shoveling snow or weeding, etc.. I think I did strain my back lightly an hour or two before the pain set in, but the acuteness of the pain was way beyond what the normal soreness should have been.  My observation is that my body's immune/inflammatory response to the vaccine somehow greatly amplified the inflammatory response to a slight muscle strain. I'm not a physician or scientist; this is my layman's sense of what is going on. I've not sought medical care -- assuming the muscle pain will subside in time; if it continues unabated into the next week then I may do so.

I did not take anything for the first 24 hours besides rest. On the second night after the vaccine I took 500mg of tylenol as I was still achy and wanted a good nights rest. On 4/24/2021, I noticed my hands (palms) starting with the right and then the left started itching and swelling. I noticed red itchy raised bumps on either sides of my hips (obliques), and multiple raised itchy red patches starting to pop-up. This continued through the weekend and on Monday (4-26-2021) I decided to go to the doctor. The doctor confirmed this as an allergic reaction but did not conclusively say that it is due to the Moderna vaccine. I have not changed any of my medication or food/activity routines since receiving the vaccine. The doctor prescribed a steroid pack (prednisone), but after discussing with the doc, I chose to start with OTC benadryl and have the prescription a back up if it did not clear in a few days.  On Tuesday (4-27-2021) 8:00am I had a sensation of a lump in my throat with mild difficulty to breath and tightness in my chest. I decided to take a Claritin and if things didn't improve in 2 hours then I would go to the doc. However, in a few hours these symptoms cleared. All this time I was only on the OTC Benadryl at night. On Thursday, (4-29-2021) I woke up to the left side of my face swelling. I went back to the doctors office at which time the doc asked me to get on prednisone the next day and gave me a steroid shot. 45mind to an hour after the shot, I noticed the swelling come down. On 4-30-2021 I started the 6 day prednisone course. All throughout this course I was still having mild itchy, red patches pop up at random locations throughout my body. On the last day of my prednisone course, 5-6-2021, I woke up to more hives on my right elbow. On the same day at lunchtime my lower lip started to swell and I had more hives pop up. So on my way back from work I visited the doctors office again. This time the doctor confirmed that what I was experiencing could be an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He gave me another steroid shot (different from the first shot) and prescribed a 3 day course of dexamethasone. I have been on that starting 5-7-2021 and they symptoms appears to have settled. Doc prescribed an extra dose of dexa, in case the symptoms persists or come back. I am to wait 7 days after my first course to start second course.

FINDINGS Adequate opacification of the pulmonary arteries, however evaluation of the lobar, segmental and subsegmental branches are markedly limited due to patient's body habitus and motion artifact.  Normal caliber of the main pulmonary artery.  No filling defects seen in central, left or right main pulmonary artery or lobar branches on the right side.   The central airways are widely patent.  Limited evaluation due to motion artifact.  Small loculated left pleural effusion.  Atelectatic changes in the left upper and left lower lobes.   There is a moderate cardiomegaly with right ventricular hypertrophy.  There is a small pericardial effusion.   There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  Unremarkable visualized thyroid gland.   Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates no gross abnormalities. Review of the bone windows is within normal limits.   IMPRESSION IMPRESSION   Nondiagnostic evaluation of the segmental and subsegmental branches of the pulmonary artery due to patient's body habitus and motion artifact.  Otherwise, no central pulmonary embolism identified.   Moderate cardiomegaly.  Small pericardial effusion and small loculated left pleural effusion.  Limited evaluation of the lung parenchyma due to motion artifact.  Findings likely reflective of pulmonary edema.   5/6/2021  5:17 PM -MD  Narrative & Impression    Interpretation Summary There is extensive thormbus in the LV cavity extending from the mid inferior and anterior walls into the dilated LV cavity and the apex. It is likely attached to the LV wall at multiple points. It measures 29mm x 29mm in cross sectional dimensions at its widest extent at the apex.   Sub-optimal opacification right ventricle, but there is a suspicion of a filling defect layering at the inferior wall which is also suggestive of a thrombus.    Limited study due to sub-optimal opacification of pulmonary arteries, but there are bilateral acute pulmonary emboli. Non-occlusive emboli in the distal right pulmonary artery. Predominantly occlusive lobar and segmental emboli in the right lower lobe. Occlusive distal segmental emboli in the posterior basal segment of left lower lobe with findings suggestive of pulmonary infarct and small left pleural effusion.    Pulmonary findings were informed by staff to inform Dr. at 16:38 hrs on 5/6/2021.    The Agatston calcium score is 0. The coronary arteries are likely normal; image quality is affected by noise (large body habitus) that affected interpretation of the mid LCx artery.    The exam quality is fair (artifacts are present that interfere with interpretation). A moderate sized (5-10 mm) circumferential pericardial effusion is noted.     Coronary Findings There is right dominant coronary anatomy. The exam quality is fair (artifacts are present that interfere with interpretation). There are normal coronary arteries. The Agatston calcium score is 0.      Left Main Coronary Artery The LM is well visualized. The left main coronary artery is not stenotic.      Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery The proximal left anterior descending artery is not stenotic. The mid left anterior descending artery is not stenotic. The distal left anterior descending artery is not stenotic. The left descending artery has 3 diagonal branches. The diagonal branches are visualized and are not stenotic.      Circumflex Coronary Artery The proximal left circumflex artery is not stenotic. The mid left circumflex artery is not stenotic. The distal left circumflex artery is not stenotic. The circumflex artery has 1 obtuse marginal branches. The obtuse marginal branches are visualized and are not stenotic. The mid circumflex artery is inadequately visualized.      Right Coronary Artery The proximal right coronary artery is not stenotic. The mid right coronary artery is not stenotic. The distal right coronary artery is not stenotic. The posterior descending coronary artery is not stenotic. The right posterior lateral arterial coronary artery is inadequately visualized.      Ventricles There is 'an apical' left ventricular thrombus. The thrombus is large. There is extensive thormbus in the LV cavity extending from the mid inferior and anterior walls into the dilated LV cavity and the apex. It is likely attached to the LV wall at multiple points. It measures 29mm x 29mm in cross sectional dimensions at its widest extent at the apex. The LV wall thickness is severely increased (concentric).      Pericardium A moderate sized (5-10 mm) circumferential pericardial effusion is noted.    Chest:  Upper thorax and posterior costophrenic angles are excluded.    Suboptimal opacification of pulmonary arteries due to the technique. However, there are nonocclusive acute embolus in the distal right main pulmonary artery and predominantly occlusive emboli in the lobar and segmental arteries of right lower lobe. Nonocclusive segmental and subsegmental emboli are noted in the right upper lobe. Occlusive distal segmental emboli in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe with findings suggestive of evolving pulmonary infarct.     Linear atelectasis in the lingula and the anterior left lower lobe.  Small left pleural effusion.  Prominent bilateral hila and mediastinal lymph nodes are likely reactive.  Small sliding hiatal hernia.    Pulmonary findings were informed by staff to inform the Dr. at 16:38 hrs on 5/6/2021.    Procedure Details Assess coronary anatomy for obstructive CAD, setting of LV thrombus The Body Mass Index is '42.78' meter squared . Cardiac CT protocol: ""Prospective"" .

Color flow Doppler, spectral analysis, and transducer compression techniques were applied during this ultrasound image examination.     RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY   On duplex examination the right common femoral vein, the sapheno-femoral junction, the femoral vein in the thigh and popliteal vein are all free of echogenic densities and demonstrate normal transducer compressibility during gray scale imaging and normal respiratory  response during Doppler interrogation.    Right proximal posterior tibial vein is non-compressible and demonstrates internal echoes.    Right peroneal vein is non-compressible and demonstrates internal echoes.      LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY   On duplex examination the left common femoral vein, the sapheno-femoral junction, the femoral vein in the thigh and popliteal vein are all free of echogenic densities and demonstrate normal transducer compressibility during gray scale imaging and normal respiratory and augmentation response during Doppler interrogation. The posterior tibial veins and peroneal veins demonstrate no evidence of thrombosis.     CONCLUSIONS:   Acute deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins as noted above.   Patent left lower extremity venous system. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity.",PHM,,"Allegra 180mg once a day, TOBACCO USE 0.5ppd","Morbid obesity, allergy rhinitis","Morbid obesity, allergy rhinitis",,,2,05/08/2021,,,Y,Pollen

The client was asked again by the vaccinator, and she again denied having received any prior COVID 19 vaccines.  She chose to have the Pfizer vaccine administered today.  When reviewing the paperwork with the staff after vaccination it was discovered that this same client had received a Janssen vaccine on 3/30/21 at a separate event.    When I arrived at the event today notified me of the event, and I went to speak with the client myself.  I found her among the crowd near the office.

I did inform her that she could not receive any more vaccines and did my best to make certain that she understood.    When I came back to the office, I went through all the consent forms again screening for any other potential errors.   In this review another vaccination error was discovered.  I spoke with staff and the vaccinator, about the situation.  The scenario is very similar. This client filled out the consent form himself and wrote in a date of March 24 without a manufacturer in the question list provided that asked about prior covid vaccines and when the vaccinator, was with the patient she identified the date written in on the consent form and she questioned the client about it and he told her that it was a mistake and specifically denied having ANY prior COVID 19 vaccinations.  He also denied having any vaccine cards issued to him ever before.  She then appropriately drew a line through the mistaken date and initialed it.   She also confirmed with the patient that he wanted the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today and he stated he wanted the 1 shot vaccine (meaning the J and J).   I then looked the client up in the system and he is documented as receiving his first dose of Pfizer on 3/15/21.

She presented to hospital on April 3 meeting SIRS criteria (fever, heart rate, respiratory rate, elevated white blood cell count) and no evidence of infection (negative UA and CXR benign).  Her exam demonstrated severe spasticity of the lower extremities with limited active or passive motion.  She had a leukocytosis of 14,000 with left shift, CRP 170 and ESR 59.  Her CK was in the 300s.  We considered a broad differential and involved neurology early on.  She had an MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine as well as a lumbar puncture that was all unremarkable for a potential cause.  Her CK continued to rise to 1700.  We started high-dose intravenous Solu-Medrol on hospital day 3 and it was not until hospital day 4 that we begin to see improvement of her spasticity.  On hospital day 4 her CK began to trend down as well and eventually normalized.  We involved rheumatology at this point who agreed that this was most likely an acute myositis given the elevated CK, myalgias, weakness, elevated inflammatory markers, and was most likely an immune mediated post vaccination event.  She did not exhibit any features concerning for inflammatory myopathy such as dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or inclusion body myositis.  HMG CoA antibody was sent and is still pending however low suspicion for a necrotizing myositis as CK was not higher.

I had trouble even leaning forward on bike because should STILL hurt--and it tapped on shoulder it would hurt incredible bad/couldn't carry daughter. Since I have higher pain tolerance- I was able to push through-however, by following week, this was no longer working--arm started swelling again.  I felt the injection was high and was talking with my mom whom  in primary care NP, and she mentioned shoulder injuries could happen if injection given too high--which is when I realized that my shoulder pain was not ""all in my head"".  S/p vaccination day 19 forward, it has seemed to flare as bad as initial day one and not gone back.   This is when I looked up and discovered there was also a condition called ""SHOULDER INJURY RELATED TO VACCINATION"" that described exact symptoms I had.     It also mentioned that damage isn't necessary should from needle--- although it was a year ago-- I had probable COVID April 2020---which could have made my immune system hyper-reactive.      I have had to call out sick April 16th because shoulder was causing pain, flushing and warm feeling.   April 19th I saw Dr-- he drew blood (I don't know what)-- didn't do full shoulder exam and referred to orthpedicc.  APril 30th I ended up calling out again as when arm would swell it made focusing at work very difficult. I saw my PCP via telehealth and she prescribed Prednisdone dose pack.   May 2nd, I  started treatment with cryotherapy machine and this was only thing that relieved pain and swelling enough to help relieve pressure.      May 7th---I saw Dr.-unfortunately, he didn't do anything because he stated a vaccine couldn't cause such type of damage to rotator cuff, didn't believe there was a condition called SIRVA and declined to treat with cortisone shot ""This whole thing started with a shot-that would be inappropriate"" .

As well as an Inhaler which helps as well and a gel tablet to help with cough.  I feel like I am finally on the rode to recovery but I am nervous about taking a 2nd Pfizer Vaccine.

I have been prescribed and taking Valacyclovir, Gabapentin, and Prednisolone eye drops to treat the Shingles.   Into week 3, Shingles rashes have all healed, blisters have all crusted out and cleared, however nerve pain continues in the head and around the eyes. The ophthalmologist suspects this to be post-Shingles effect, i.e., Postherpetic Neuralgia. My current condition results in Insomnia during various nights, and itchiness/tingling sensations, for which I have to apply cold/wet compress and Calamine Lotion to provide temporary relief.  As a result of above following the 1st COVID vaccine, I have postponed my 2nd COVID-19 (Pfizer) vaccine to 5/22. However, my confidence level to proceed and get this 2nd vaccine on 5/22 is low at this time, until CDC is able to let me know whether there is a link between the COVID-19 vaccine and this causing Shingles in rare cases, to help me avoid a repeat of the stressful experience after the 1st COVID-19 shot.

Patient looked fine as I was able to have a brief conversation with him while waiting for the shot.

At 10:45am, I was ringing up a prescription at Terminal 42 when hearing the word, Help, coming from the Patient Health Room. Within seconds later, the door was opened as I was running out the pharmacy toward the Patient Health Room to see what happened. The patient was lying on the floor, unconscious, while his fianc� was calling his name asking whether he was okay and rolled him to his side and supported his head. I reached into the cabinet and prepared to administer an EPIPEN to the patient, meanwhile, pharmacy technicians, asked and dialed 911. As his fianc� kept calling his name, the patient gained consciousness. I asked intern what had happened to clarify whether it was a reaction due to the vaccination or not. Meanwhile, the patient's fianc� stated this event was not unexpected. Patient was able to talk and confirmed he was fine. Unfortunately, it appeared that the patient bruised his nose and forehead with slight blood from a minor cut. We instructed the patient and his fianc� to stay in the room and offered assistance upon request until EMS arrived. Patient's fianc� requested an ice pack for his bruise. Later on, the patient appeared to be shaking, so I asked the fianc� whether it was okay to give him some GATORADE. His fianc� also requested a glucose meter to check his blood sugar. The EMS arrived within minutes and patient was transported to hospital Before they were leaving, I asked the fianc� if there was anything she would like us to do as well as offered a follow-up. She declined the offer. I also asked briefly if she could share his medical condition, but the fianc� only disclosed that the patient has needle anxiety.

I was clammy and had some hives on my back and hips. I sat on the side of the bed I stretched my arms did some yoga type moves trying to see if being less active the day after the shot maybe had my back a little tight causing the pain.  I chewed two tums thinking that might help to get rid of the pain even though I knew it was worse than heartburn. After 15 mins at 3:15 I woke my husband to let him know it was not going away and that I was not sure what was going on but just in case I did not want to be ridiculous and sit there and have a heart attack. I'm not one to run to the doctor, I'm very healthy but thought to myself this may be more serious.  My husband ask about calling for help and I said lets just see what happens and just know if I need help then you at least know my symptoms now . I woke the next morning and felt much better and made a joke about all the crazy people being right stating ""they are trying to kill us""  Later in the week on Thursday playing tennis I felt me left arm going numb, I shrugged it off to hitting the ball hard and it never crossed my mind about anything else.

My pain was nearly gone, I no longer felt muscle tightness, and assumed that the condition was resolving itself, and that the rash was heat rash from the heating pad.   Friday the rash was redder and my abdomen showed signs of significant swelling. I still thought this was muscular, that perhaps I had pulled the abdomen, treated with ice and decided to visit Orthopedic urgent care Saturday.  Saturday the pain had increased. I went to Urgent care, and was told I have shingles. I asked if the covid vaccine could have caused shingles to flare, was told ""theoretically"", but thar we do not really know enough to say whether the vaccine contributed, or whether it was coincidence.  At home, I read a bit on the covid vaccine qnd shingles, saw what appeared to be anti-vaccer propaganda, but also read about this self-reporting system...so, I thought that I might as well submit my info.",,,,,,,,,N,04/28/2021,05/01/2021,3,"No medical tests, just medical examination.",PVT,,Vitamin D Elderberry,Inflammation in back muscles,None,,,2,05/09/2021,,Y,,None

1301034,05/09/2021,MI,72.0,72,,F,,"I am a 72 year old woman in very good health. I received the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on March 8, 2021 and everything was fine. I then received the second vaccine on March 29, 2021.  The day after I received the 2nd Pfizer vaccine I developed scalp psoriasis. (I only had this once about 6 years ago). I fought it for 2 1/2 weeks. It cleared up on April 21, 2021.  That evening my right wrist  began to itch terribly. Within a couple hours my right hand and arm swelled and got red up to just below my elbow. I went to the doctor 2 days later on April 23, 2021. I had gotten poked by a cat claw the day this started and was told it was cellulitis even though cellulitis does not itch like that and there was no pain nor soreness. I have had cats for over 35 years and been poked, scratched, and bit many times with no reaction. Two hours after leaving the doctor?s office, the rash and swelling progressed up to the inside of my elbow. I went to emergency and was told again it was cellulitis. They gave me iv anitbiotics and sent me home with a prescription for amoxicilan. Three hours after returning home, my left hand started itching. It then also became inflamed and swollen like the right hand. The swelling went down within 2 days and I continued talking the prescription for the 7 days. I had a follow up visit with my doctor on April 30, 2021, and all looked well. Two days later the itching began again on my right arm in the bend of my elbow. This was May 3, 2021.  I went back to emergency and was admitted to the hospital where they were giving me iv vancomycin. I had no pain nor fever. On the 3rd day, May 5, 2021, my right knee and left foot began itching. Both areas then became inflamed and swelled.  I saw 6 doctors during this hospital stay and they were all perplexed. They sent an Infectious Disease Specialist who said it was a reaction to the original iv antibiotic that I was given on April 23, 2021, for what was diagnosed as cellulitis.  I was released on day 4, May 6, 2021.  I never felt comfortable with any of the diagnosis. I was never in any pain, had no fever, nor any other indications of cellulitis except for the rash and swelling. Cellulitis does not go from the right hand to the left hand, to the right elbow, to the right knee, to the left foot! I didn?t agree with the diagnosis of being allergic to the first antibiotic I was given. The only thing I have ever shown a reaction to is Tetnus. Granted we can develop allergies in life but this is a stretch.  Upon returning home I called a friend of mine who said that her husband had the same thing happen to him after the second Pfizer vaccine! He scratched the effected area so much he broke skin. He went his doctor and she was smart enough to guess it was a reaction to the vaccine but his scratching may have caused a bit of cellulitis. He was given an anibiotic ointment to use on his scratches and told to take Zyrtec during the day and Benadryl at night. That cleared him upI   I have to wonder now how any people are experiencing this after being vaccinated and their doctors are misdiagnosing it as cellulitis. My experience resulted in days of misery and probably around a $20K hospital bills for nothing. I think that people and doctors especially, need to know that the vaccine can cause this to happen so it can be treated correctly without what I was put through.  We are not being given all of the information that we should know. I realized no one wants to start a panic about being vaccinated but this is just WRONG. Wrong and causing a lot of unnecessary misery along with costing tens of thousands of dollars in unneeded medical costs. I can be reached by phone to discuss with more detail .

Patient was advised of the following quarantine instructions:  There are multiple viral infections that could be causing your symptoms.

Only follow up in the ER if you are in respiratory distress or your fever continues to elevate. In order to protect your family, you need to stay as isolated as possible within your house, ideally in your own room.

1301480,05/09/2021,VA,48.0,48,,F,,"Symptoms & time course 03/31/21:  Within 2-3 min after taking the Covid-19 Pfizer shot in my left upper arm, my entire arm became nearly 80% immobilized ( I felt that I was going to lose my arm movement completely but it came back). In about 5 min time, I felt a strong stomach disturbance (something like stomach diarrhea) briefly for a few seconds, and then my heart rate increased suddenly a lot and I felt a strong gush of heat coming out of my face and upper half of the body, and then I started to feel unwell. I also felt moderate pressure in my ears and the head wasn't feeling well either. My hands and fingers were trembling a lot. The paramedics checked my vitals, I think the blood pressure was around 117/62 and  pulse was around 85. After another 5 minutes or so, I started to feel better.   For the next 2-3 hours post-vaccination, I had felt mild symptoms of headache, nausea, and sensation of cough in the throat. Few times I also felt mild sensations of chest discomfort and that I may develop some difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath, and once I also felt a mild sensation of throat moving up and down (no throat closure), and none of these symptoms had developed to that of a higher intensity such that someone else could see them happening. About 5 hours post-vaccination (i.e. around 8:30 pm) I felt that I have a reaction going on in the body which continued for an hour. About 6 hours post-vaccination (i.e. around 9:30 pm), I felt that the reaction that was occurring in the body had ended with the skin on both of my arms becoming red in color and the skin texture was looking like that of a burnt skin (I did not take a picture of the arm with skin redness). The whole-left-arm had swollen relatively more than the whole-right-arm and I also noted mild swelling in the left arm wrist and palm. Also, a large part of the muscle just above the elbow on the left arm had swollen a lot (appearing like a bump) with muscle stiffness, and this muscle bump was mildly painful if you apply pressure on to it. There were also some mildly painful nodules in the upper left arm and the arm muscles generally appeared to be hardened. The veins & some arteries also appeared more prominent in the left arm compared to the right arm. I had noted that the swelling and redness in both the arms had started to decrease after 30 min of appearing and got reduced a lot more after about 2 hours (i.e. 11:30 pm). There was also a very mild facial swelling at night and I had felt feverish for about 25 min or so.   04/01/21 Next day early morning (i.e. 6 am) I noted abdominal or stomach bloating of higher magnitude, and I wasn't feeling very well with some mild sensations of throat moving up and down and a feeling that I may develop shortness of breath but these symptoms did not develop in higher intensity and began to subside after about an hour. As the day progressed, I started to feel better and by afternoon all of the symptoms were better except that the swelling and a hive (or muscle bump) on the left arm were still present. I also had moderate soreness around the site of injection in the upper left arm.  04/02/21 Next day morning the swelling and hive (or muscle bump) in the upper left arm were getting better but had not completely gone. By the end of the day the arm swelling had mostly subsided and the large muscle bump in the upper arm had reduced in size but still present with a mild pain. The left upper arm soreness around the site of injection had reduced.  04/03/21 & 04/04/21 The hive or (muscle bump) in the upper left arm was highly reduced in size but still present with a mild pain on applying pressure.  04/05/21 I felt some minor chest discomfort and minor pain repeatedly for a few seconds during the afternoon hours while at work. These symptoms subsided by evening hours.  04/06/21 I felt a mild chest congestion with a little bit of phlem in the chest at night which then got better after an hour or so.  04/14/21 I noted a rash on the left side of the lower neck (just above the shoulder) which extended from the left-side of the neck towards the center of neck, at night (i.e. 11:45 pm). The intensity of redness had reduced in the next 30 min or so and the rash was nearly gone by the next day morning.  Final outcomes: The allergic reaction symptoms that I had developed after taking the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech had mostly resolved on their own in a week. I did not take any medications to help relieve the allergy symptoms.   Concerns and queries:  1) Would it be safe for me to take a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech?  2) Would an anti-allergy medication be helpful to take before receiving a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech?  3) Is it safe to receive a Covid-19 vaccine from a different company (e.g. Johnson & Johnson or Novavax)?

Second: April 27 my right forehead just below the hairline and in the right ear area where the top of the ear meets the head, had minor itching and were turning red. On April 28. Hives began on my left arm's lower wrist and in the general area of my right leg's knee. The hives became more numerous in these areas until a general red rash condition was appearing  between them as well. By Saturday Morning May 1 the knee and wrist areas were noticeably red like a rash and hives were also appearing with itching below the right knee on the upper half of my shin, above this knee, on my right lower wrist and on my left lower fore arm.  My right ear was starting to swell at just the top. I tried putting Gold Bond Medicated Powder on these areas, but it didn't reduce the itching much.      Sunday May 2, I called my mom who is a Registered Nurse about this. She advised going to my health care provider to substantiate these symptoms. Monday May 3 I visited my health care provider's office after work and got an appointment for Tuesday at 10:15 from a cancellation. One of their RN's looked at my hives and rashes. New hives had now also formed on my left leg just below the knee on the back side. It was a red string of itching a couple inches long. I called my boss Tuesday so I could take the day off for the appointment and he agreed that I should do  this. At the doctor's office, PA-C after extensive questioning and examination said he thought this was an allergic reaction possibly related to the polyethylene content of the vaccination. He further advised that I not get the second shot until I was checked by an allergist. He put in a referral for this. I think I picked up cold-like symptoms (sore throat and cough) from the doctor's office that were minor.      Wednesday morning I had much worse symptoms. I was weak, groggy, couldn't think without great effort, was more itchy, and my right knee was starting to ooze. I called my boss at work to take the day off since I was quite sure driving would be risky, and that I would have to leave work early for lack of energy. My right front thigh had a new area of hives along with my right and left fore arms. I started treating all my affected areas with Caladryl topical Analgesic and taking generic Benedryl. I had breakfast and then slept until 2:30 PM, had lunch and slept until evening. By then my forehead and right ear areas had reduced in severity. I had lost (2) days of work. The rest of the week, all my symptoms diminished.

I stayed flat in bed the whole day and the second day after (4/8/21), it subsided. After the second vaccine on 4/27/21, it was a much more significant response. This occurred again at about 5am the morning after the vaccine (4/28, less than 12 hours after), my blood pressure began to fall and I was experiencing orthostatic hypotension again.  On 4/29 significant body aches and pains (flu like symptoms set in). On Friday 4/30/21, I woke up, and without moving, the room was spinning, I felt like I was going to throw up, had bad headaches, and I was extremely dizzy. I took my blood pressure at it was 80/50. I could not stand or sit up, I had to lay flat with my legs propped up to keep blood flow to my head. I missed work from 4/28-5/1 as I was so hypotensive and symptomatic. I called my cardiologists office on the afternoon of 4/30 to get their advice and confirm that I should NOT take my hypertension and tachycardia medications that night (verapamil and metoprolol). The nurse advised me not to take them that day and to go to the hospital since I was so symptomatic. My mom, a cardiac care nurse, was with me at home, so I decided to stay home and only go in if it dropped any lower. The next day (Saturday) it began to normalize to around 110/70 and Sunday I was 120/80. I did not take any medication Saturday or Sunday, because I did not want my pressure to go low again. Monday I contacted my cardiologists office again, because I was still reading normal with no meds in my system, but was beginning to get chest pains related to the withdrawal from metoprolol, so they had me take the verapamil and metoprolol in normal doses Monday afternoon. Tuesday, I woke up low again (100/60) and had to call off work again. I contacted my cardiologist again, and he advised me to stop verapamil until my pressure got more high and I needed it again and called in a lower dose of my metoprolol (half the strength of what I was taking).

(This was my first indication I was reacting.)  Then my tongue started to tingle. Over a period of another five minutes the tingling spread to my lips, within another few minutes the tingling spread to the rood of my mouth.  As I sat in my car the tingling intensified and the innerside of my lower lip and my tongue felt denser, as if they were swelling. However, this swelling was not visible; yet, it was very much there from my experience.  The nurse at the site kept coming around to check on me throughout this time period. I believe I waited 30-45 minutes so that I could be monitored. Finally the nurse and I agreed it would be okay for me to go home.  My daughter-in-law drove me home. I took a Benadryl and within 1.5 hours the sensations were completely gone. I was symptom free the rest of the day except for some slight sensation at the injection site.  This reaction to the 1st dose has me quite concerned about taking the 2nd dose.  My body is severely sensitive to a wide range of substances.  In 2016 I was receiving desensitization shots for environmental allergens. I had returned to the shots after stopping them for about 5 months due to severe asthma. When I returned to the shots, I was started on a reduced dose/potency + had a mild anaphylactic shock reaction. We waited 2 weeks + tried again and I had a slightly more serious A.S. reaction.  Then we waited 1-1 1/2 month + redid testing for allergens.  I had slightly stronger reactions to those.. At that point the doctor + I agreed the testing + injections would be completely stopped.  It is because of these experiences + the mild reaction to the 1st Covid vaccine that a 2nd injection is inadvisable for me. My primary care doctor and pulmonologist agree with me.

At 2:05pm, pharmacy technician, started processing paperwork. Patient appeared normal as I, pharmacy on duty, slightly took a glance while he was at Covid 19 Vaccine Check-in window. He appeared to actively talking on phone via his wireless headphone. After processing the paperwork needed for vaccination, I went over the system to ensure the provided information was adequate before it was ready for my intern to administer the shot. Once the process was completed, as usual, pharmacy intern, took the patient to Patient Health Room for immunization. After the vaccination, as I was getting off the phone with a doctor calling in a prescription, approached and told me the patient fainted right after the vaccination, she called out my name for help, but I did not hear. Later on pharmacy technician said she was close by the area but did not hear pharmacy intern. Fortunately, the pharmacy intern said she kept calling his name and patted at the patient's shoulder softly, the patient woke up, this happened just within less than 1 minute. From pharmacy intern's report, the patient shook his head vigourously, and breathed rapidly through his lips after he woke up. Pharmacy intern instructed the patient to have a seat outside the Patient Health Room for close monitoring. I then walked outside and briefly talked to the patient. Patient stated he was perfectedly fine, said in a humor way ""Yes, I passed out, but I'm perfectly fine now."" Based on the vaccine administration record, patient has no medical condition. He also confirmed he had lunch before coming, so I concluded the faint was not due to hypoglycemic. I offered whether he needed anything just know that we are here. I also reassured patient to stay at least 15 minutes before he was ready to head out. it seemed like patient was actively on the phone or listened to music via his wireless headphone as I occasionally glanced at him via the mirror. Approximately 15 minutes later, patient checked in at the consultation window asking whether it was okay for him to leave. I asked him again if he was sure and felt well; he confirmed. In addition, I verified his phone number so we could call him for follow-up if needed.

1301633,05/10/2021,OH,41.0,41,,M,,"On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was ""borderline"" according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for ""exploratory surgery"" with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn't stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn't even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.",,,,,Y,11,,,N,04/18/2021,04/22/2021,4,Blood work.

The intensity of the pain on my arms decreased about half at around 3:10AM and I was finally able to fall asleep at around 3:30AM.

Symptoms predominantly fever and fatigue all day Saturday, with temp hovering around 100.7-101.5 during the day. I expected symptoms like this based on others' experiences. The reason I am reporting is that I briefly passed out right around the 24 hour mark. I had eaten very little (a banana and two eggs that morning) but was drinking a fair amount of fluids, and had basically slept most of the day. Around 1:30PM, I woke up, took my temperature, and was surprised to see it read 101.5 - I felt cooler or at least I felt less uncomfortably warm than I had when it read higher. I got up, reheated some soup, and just as I was pouring it in the bowl, was hit with an overwhelming wave of nausea and dizziness such that I thought I wouldn't make it to the bathroom. En route, I bumped into a piece of furniture with my right arm. I remember grabbing my arm and the next thing I knew, I was lying on the hallway floor. I must have slid down somehow, because I didn't have any head pain or bump to the head - and managed to get to the bathroom. After a time, the nausea passed without vomiting, I made it back to bed, fell asleep, and felt better enough when I woke two hours later to eat some soup. I continued to drink a lot of fluids and had a smoothie before bed. My temperature peaked at 102.3 that night before bed. Overnight Saturday, I sweat through two shirts. My temperature Sunday morning was 99.1 and I noticed some low-level ""COVID rash"" at my injection site before bed Sunday night. I woke this morning (Monday) at 5AM to discover I had sweat through another shirt, but my temp was finally back to 97.1. Again, I wouldn't have reported this as out of the ordinary, if I hadn't briefly passed out. I should say that Saturday (day after my shot) was also the first full day of my period. I don't know if it was fever, blood sugar, cramps, vertigo, or the virus - but that particular wave of nausea and dizziness at 24 hours was really intense.

Patient received her first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine this morning, was observed and ultimately started to drive home with mother when she developed shortness of breath, nausea and chest discomfort.  These have been progressive.  She reports she is not taking her Flovent.  No vomiting, no rash, no weakness, headache or dizziness. Remainder of history per note above.   Vital signs as noted above (tachycardia, tachypneic).  On physical exam, the patient is anxious appearing, hyperventilating; HEENT exam with MMM, clear conjunctivae, normal TMs & clear oropharynx without uvular swelling or edema; neck is supple; cardiovascular exam is stable with regular rhythm, mild tachycardia, no murmurs; pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally, good aeration, no wheezes; abdomen is soft, non-tender & non-distended; neurologic exam nonfocal, moves all four extremities, 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities, carpal spasm of bilateral hands (L>R).   My impression is that this patient is having a panic attack given her rapid onset of hyperventilation, chest discomfort, and bilateral carpal spasms. Carpal spasms improved with controlled breathing. Considered anaphylaxis given patient's history, but absolutely no wheezing, rash or significant GI symptoms; no hypoxia; no hypotension. Epi-pen at bedside, but not given. Considered asthma, but no wheezing - patient is not wheezing and has good aeration on exam, she is requesting albuterol, which I think will help with her anxiety surrounding this - 2 puffs given. No evidence of persistent tachycardia to suggest PE (no OCPS). Initial ECG with sinus arrhythmia, one PVC, slightly prolonged QTc 477 - will check repeat. Patient briefly on NRB for comfort - slowly able to be weaned off and during observation in ED, symptoms improving but not completely resolved. Repeat ECG w/ NSR, slightly prolonged QTc 460. Given persistence of symptoms, patient given epi-pen and had almost complete resolution of symptoms within 10 minutes. We will plan to observe for 4 hours post-epi administration. Recommended discussion of second COVID vaccine with primary care provider but may have to avoid given this could have represented a serious allergic reaction. Recommend follow-up with PCP/cardiology for repeat EKG.

Initially felt this was anxiety however symptoms persisted.  Treated with albuterol as well as epinephrine and observed.  Developed shortness of breath and complaints of chest pain after approximately 3 hours of observation.  Repeat EKG obtained and is normal.  Labs were obtained which demonstrated normal CBC.

History: Left lower extremity swelling. Pain Comparison: No prior imaging for comparison Technique and findings: Gray scale, color, and pulsed Doppler were done.  The bilateral external iliac veins demonstrates normal respiratory variability without occlusive thrombus. The common femoral, profunda femoral, and proximal femoral veins demonstrate patency on grayscale and color Doppler. There is nonocclusive thrombus in the mid femoral vein with occlusive thrombus noted in the distal femoral vein, popliteal, tibioperoneal trunk, and posterior tibial veins. The peroneal vein is not visualized suspicious for occlusive thrombus. The bilateral posterior tibial and peroneal veins in the calf are unremarkable without evidence of venous thrombosis.     Impression: Nonocclusive thrombus in the mid femoral vein with occlusive thrombus noted from the distal femoral vein down to the level of the posterior tibial veins. The peroneal veins are not visualized and this is suspicious for occlusive thrombus. This clot does expand the vein although in part is echogenic.

Within 10 min of getting the vaccine my head was splitting and pounding so badly I talked to the nurse. I have had a migraine before, but this was different and unlike any headache I ever have had. Lights did not bother me, but sounds were harsher. The frontal lobe of my head is where it hurt, not in my temples and not anywhere else.  The pounding was so bad I was nauseous and dizzy feeling. I was told to go home and take tylenol and I did so. I use arthritis tylenol which is the strongest and I took 2 but it didn't help take away the pain. Sleeping helped some, which was surprising as I have never been able to sleep with any headache or migraine before.  The headache lasted throughout that first day, throughout the second day and mostly through the third day. It started to lesson around 9pm on the third day. By this time I had tried naproxyn, ibuprophen, and tylenol (i am allergic to asprin). Nothing helped what so ever.  On the fourth day the much milder headache still lingered and on the fifth day it was finally gone.  The nausea and dizziness lasted the entire first day and through part of the second day.  I am someone who walks on broken bones and stage 5 avascular necrosis without complaint. I am labelled someone who doesn't feel the same amount of pain as most people do. It is common for me to hurt myself and not even know it until someone points it out.  So pain I can normally handle, I also have techniques to lesson pain that I use every day, but nothing helped this headache.  As someone who dislocated her finger and popped it back in myself and went back to cooking immediately... The headache was not manageable. I tried Everything I know to do.  I actually felt like my brain was on fire and going to explode. I was concerned enough to talk to a nurse, which is also something I would not do if it did not feel like that.  When I get a migraine and the lights hurt my eyes, I pop on some glasses and continue onward. Not a big deal.   But with whatever happened to my brain that day, I'd say 90% would have ended up in the emergency room.

Most of the small intestine and large intestine was affected. o Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, ICG injection for evaluation of perfusion  Indication and Consent  Findings: . Findings: Even after the ICG injection.  There was spotty tissue necrosis from mid jejunum all the way through sigmoid colon.  Most areas were blackened with a foul smell.  There was some highlighted areas secondary to the ICG but not a significant amount that would lend for an anastomosis.  Black ascites was present throughout the abdomen.  Unfortunately after much contemplation there was no surgical intervention.   Procedure  Procedure: Patient was placed in supine position.  Was intubated in the emergency room so, we were able to proceed with resuscitation through our anesthesia team.  Patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Proceeded to make a midline incision.  The blood supply in the subcutaneous tissues did not even bleed.  Appeared to be darkened and almost coagulated.  As we entered through the fascia we were able to open the peritoneum between 2 hemostats.  The large rush of free air through from the abdomen.  We then proceeded to open the abdomen for the length of her incision.  This was done with electrocautery.  From here there was a black ascites present within the abdomen.  There was a large amount of dead intestine that we could immediately see.  I worked my way to the ligament of Treitz.  There was no adhesions so this was easily found.  That intestine did appear to be pink.  It lasted for about a foot.  After that area everything was either black or purple in color with a few pink spots in between.  This went all the way down to the terminal ileum where pneumatosis was visualized.  We then looked at the colon from cecum through rectum.  It appeared to be blackened as well.  Not knowing whether all of this intestine was dead or not especially with patient being hypotensive I injected ICG dye approximately 2 cc.  This was to evaluate perfusion.  Unfortunately perfusion was no better than what I could visualize.  I could not even find enough room of the colon or small intestine to make an anastomosis.  Was very hard decision, however, we did not resect any bowel.  I closed the patient's abdomen.  Patient will be taken to ICU on ventilator.

I began doing daily stretches /exercises to try to regain mobility in the left arm.  After about 3 weeks there was some improvement in mobility but still pain with many movements.  I began researching arm pain following covid vaccine and discovered there can be injury caused by vaccines being injected too high, above the muscle.  I contacted my Dr's office and asked for advice on what to do next to improve my arm function.  Physical therapy was suggested.  I received my second covid dose on 4-14-21. I spoke to the RN administering the 2nd dose about my previous shot.  She said it likely was injected into the rotator cuff area from my description of where the bandage was located.  She measured 3 finger widths down from the boney point and injected into the muscle.  I did not have any worsening  mobility issues from the second dose.

Face was hive free. Hives are itchy but not unbearable if left alone. Treated with 2 benadryl (Diphenhydramine HCI, 25 mg), reaction went down. Later that same evening, hive reaction returned and worsened over the evening, this time the hives were concentrated on my forearms, especially on my right arm (injection site). The actual local injection site on the shoulder remained relatively hive free. Hives grew and joined together into large blotches. Treated with 3 benadryl. The next morning (May 10) I woke up my arms relatively hive free although there are some minor blotches. Now I have minor red blotches on my face and neck, and some on my lower legs. Treating with 1 benadryl. Will likely not seek medical attention unless hives worsen dramatically. No other symptoms - breathing is fine.   Unclear whether this is actually a reaction to the Moderna vaccine, but it is my best guess. There have been no changes to my diet, medications, or behavior. Bed sheets and clothing have been washed and changed without an effect on the reaction. I am not experiencing elevated stress.

Patient is a very pleasant 69-year-old Caucasian female who was recently diagnosed for acute CVA with right-sided weakness during admission at Medical Center on 1/13/2021, presents with a chief complaint of right-sided weakness and right-sided numbness.  Patient states that she was at Medical Center, admitted for acute CVA for 5 days.  She received a PT and OT and was getting better and thereafter discharged to home. Last night patient started having similar symptoms of weakness of the right side along with right-sided numbness.  Patient states that she started with tingling sensation on the bottom of the right foot.  This was new for the patient.  Patient tried to sleep and when she woke up she had right arm numbness.  She also felt weaker on the right upper and lower extremity.  Patient reported this to her husband and patient was subsequently brought to emergency department at Hospital.  Patient was noted to be hypertensive on the initial evaluation.  Patient reports her blood pressure was 158 over 80s last night and to her knowledge this was the highest blood pressure she had noted.  She had been told by her PCP to start amlodipine if her blood pressure went up.  She takes amlodipine 2.5 mg daily.  Patient also reported having more intense headache last night retro-orbitally.  Patient has on and off mild headaches.  Patient states that she had taken her first dose of cold vaccine last Sunday and was feeling generalized malaise for couple of days.  She recovered from this. Patient states she had been getting Evenity injection under the recommendation of osteoporosis specialist at Medical Center.  She had taken 8 out of 12 monthly injections and the last one was in middle of December 2020.  Patient had been warned by pharmacist at Medical Center in regard to the black box warning of this injection as it can predispose to MI and CVA.  Patient has stopped injection since the diagnosis of CVA at Medical Center.     Hospital Course: Patient was admission to hospital with concern for repeat stroke versus TIA.  She had a stroke January 13 diagnosed Medical Center.  She had gone to physical therapy and Occupational Therapy she is doing well.  She states yesterday he noted some numbness and tingling in her right foot which eventually spread up to her right leg she went to bed woke up in the morning with a heavy sensation in her right upper extremity and right leg and came to the hospital.  CTs in the emergency room demonstrated a small focal area of low-attenuation within the bilateral basal ganglia appearing a subacute to chronic infarcts.  She also underwent MRI which demonstrated subacute infarct involving the left corona radiata posterior left putamen with no associated hemorrhage. She was evaluated by neurology who recommended full-strength aspirin with Plavix for 21 days to follow-up with Medical Center.  She just underwent echocardiogram at Medical Center therefore this is not felt necessary to perform here.  I have placed an order for a cardiac event monitor to evaluate for any sign of dysrhythmia including atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.  At time of discharge the patient's strength had returned she states that she felt like she did at the end of her rehabilitation.  She knows what exercises to do at home as well.

I certify that this patient is able to leave their home only with considerable and taxing effort* and needs intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, and/or speech therapy. This patient is under my care and I have authorized home health services related to the care I am providing this patient.    *Note to Physician: Patients that leave home infrequently for short periods MAY still be considered homebound. Some examples: Medical appointments, adult day care, barber, religious services, dialysis.         Dear Provider: Effective for home health episodes beginning on or after January 1, 2015 insurance revised Face to Face requirements. The clinical narrative has been eliminated and attestation/certification statements along with the date of the Face to Face encounter only are required.    PLEASE NOTE: This change requires that the physician record contain supporting documentation of the Face to Face encounter and the diagnosis for which the patient is being referred for home care which, if record review by insurance is conducted, will form the basis for eligibility for home health services.  If the home health agency receives a denial for services, the physician claim for certifying/recertifying patient eligibility for insurance covered home health services is considered non-covered as well because there is no longer a corresponding claim for insurance covered home health services.    All patients are eligible for care regardless of race, color, national origin, ancestry, religious creed, age, gender, sexual preference, handicap, or the source of payment for care.

She suggested that usually hives are treated with a steroid, however since I had recently had the 2nd dose of COVID vaccine, it was not recommended as it would decrease my immune system further. She prescribed hydroxine HCL 25 mg. Monday morning I picked up some Benadryl, as the 24 hr pharmacy was not nearby. I took a nap then felt groggy the rest of the day. A pharmacist friend suggested I take Pepcid and Claritin (non-drowsy), then the hydroxine at night. I started this regime on Tuesday. Hives continued to come, then go on different areas of my body through Friday (5/7/21) around noon. I continued to take the above stated medications through Sat. to ensure the hives would not return.

She states that on 30  March she received first dose of her Covid vaccine.  Just over one week later she developed a red spotty rash across the left arm and left trunk that was itchy.  The rash has persisted until this time.  She has a history of plantar neuromas that have been surgically excised and has persistent left foot pain.  She felt a significant worsening of this so she went to the ER and was given prescription of Celebrex.  3 days after taking the Celebrex she developed symptoms of left-sided facial puffiness underneath the jaw and developed left-sided facial weakness and arm weakness.  Due to appropriate concern for a stroke she presented to the emergency room and was later admitted.  She had a number of CT scans and MRIs all of which were normal.  While she was in the hospital she underwent a number of blood tests which were ultimately negative.  She underwent an echo and after she sat up from having this completed she had a recurrence of the left-sided facial weakness. Neurology evaluated with the following comments, ""42 yo female with no significant PMHx with onset of left facial weakness, left upper and lower extremity weakness and paresthesias. No lower extremity weakness on exam today and minimal give-way weakness in multiple muscle groups in the left upper extremity. No pronator drift. Reflexes are symmetric and intact. Sensory is intact in extremities. Left facial weakness is mild with some fluctuating features. No Bell?s phenomenon which is commonly seen with CN VII palsy. Imaging studies are not consistent with ischemic or hemorrhage stroke. Duration of symptoms are not consistent with TIA. MRI without evidence of demyelinating disease process. Low likelihood of migraine. Rash does not appear to be herpetic in nature. Other autoimmune processes are possible given the joint pain and tenderness. No significant edema on exam. Post vaccine response less likely. No ophthalmoplegia or ataxia. Consider facial dystonia.""  Upon discharge from the hospital she has waxing and waning left-sided facial weakness.  She admits that it might be provoked the more that she talks or smiles.  Just prior to the patient's weakness episodes she will feel a pressure across the left temple around her ear.  She still has this pinpoint rash across left side of her abdomen and left arm.  There is a focal swelling in the antecubital space of her left arm that has never been characterized. Broad testing negative to this point. Potentially symptoms associated with moderna covid-19 vaccination. As outpatient she has been tested for myasthenia gravis, lyme disease, rheumatoid conditions.
