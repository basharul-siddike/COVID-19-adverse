1395362,06/14/2021,NY,48.0,48,,M,,"I was playing ice hockey on April 10, 2021 when I started to experience shortness of breath.  Coming to the bench between shifts is part of the game and that time on the bench is used to recover (both for your muscles and for your cardiovascular system).  However, towards the latter part of the game, I continued to be short of breath even while sitting on the bench.  Then in the last 10 minutes or so of the game, I fell to the ice for no reason.  It was as if my muscles had just totally failed.  I thought the shortness of breath may have been a sign of a Covid infection since I had not reached the 14 day period after my second shot.  So I went to urgent care to get a Covid test.  My test came back negative, but the doctor was concerned with my symptoms, so he took an x-ray of my heart and an ECG.  He said that he noticed a blur around my heart, but didn't have any explanation.  He thought I was in very good health, so he gave me a list of heart specialists to contact if I had another 'episode'.  Fortunately, I did not have another episode.  The only reason that I am submitting this incident is because I understand the administration is having an emergency meeting to review cases of an inflamed heart.

My normal BP during this pregnancy has been in the 90-100/50's-60's range. I got my 2nd vaccine on May 29 around 9:15 am, by 9:21 I suddenly got a strong feeling as if I was about to vomit, then my heart began to pound and was racing, then I felt dizzy and light headed, then my mouth went extremely dry. I told the people at the pharmacy that I was ill and they had me sit in the vaccination room, took my blood pressure and gave me water and an ice pack. The blood pressure cuff was not the right size, but read my BP as being 117/72. After sitting for about 30 minutes I began to feel better so I went to sit in the observation area again. I waited until it was an hour after I felt sick before leaving to do shopping. I walked the store for about 30 minutes before returning to the pharmacy. I kept getting waves of nausea, heart palpitations, and dizziness and extreme dry mouth, I was feeling very lethargic. By the time I got back to the pharmacy I was begining to feel out of it and decided to call the paramedics. They took my BP again and it was 127/41. I began to shake by the time the paramedics arrived and needed help onto the stretcher to take me out to the ambulance. In the ambulance my BP was 149/85.  I began to feel better on my way to the ER, but kept getting waves of nausea/ feeling like my BP was high/dizziness with the addition of heat flashes. I told the nurses and doctor at the ER that I thought I was having a reaction to my vaccine and described what happened, but they only treated me for nausea and on my discharge papers said I was there because of nausea. They gave me anti-nausea medicine and after a few hours they gave me the option of going home or staying to get I.V fluids. I chose to get I.V. fluids and stayed a few hours longer until I felt less out of it and like the waves of sickness were less intense/ frequent.

Then 4 days of no blood, but ""normal"" (usual) infected sputum colors (preexisting lung infection; see continuation page).  Then on 06/11 beginning @ 7:57am, fresh (light) blood streaks/tinged sputum, which occurred a number of times over the span of approximately 5 hours, until ""normal"" pale yellow infected sputum was expectorated.  Then on 06/12 beginning @ 9:30am, fresh blood again, which again occurred a number of times over the span of about 5 hours until the usual infected colors of sputum were expectorated. Additional information for Item 18: I have a history of MAI/MAC infection and resultant hemoptysis since 2006.  However, until the first Pfizer dose, it had been 2 years since the last incident of hemoptysis, which was due, at least in large part, to malnutrition spanning a couple of months, for reasons unrelated to the lungs.  I believe my most recent hemoptysis episodes are a result of my immune system being distracted by the Covid-19 vaccine, thus allowing the Mycobacterium avium (and/or other) to more effectively attack my lung tissue.  There was no hemoptysis yesterday (06/13), but this has me concerned about the second dose causing additional, possibly worse, problems for my immune system, as it needs to be concentrating on my lung infection full-time; it has been keeping the MAC (and/or other) generally under control, assuming hemoptysis is a good indicator, which my X-rays over the years of monotherapy with Ethambutol suggest is the case.  I discontinued Ethambutol on 06/15/2012, with no further hemoptysis until 04/26/2019, and then no hemoptysis until 11 days after the first Pfizer Covid-19 dose. It seems reasonable to conclude that the vaccine led to these latest hemoptysis events and perhaps allowed the preexisting bacterial infection to cause additional lung damage.The physician noted above is my current pulmonologist.  I was to have follow-up lung CT scan and lung function tests, but did not do so in 2020 because of Covid-19 concerns.  I had planned to see Dr. and my other doctors after being fully-vaccinated, but since lung function tests cannot be performed on patients with active/recent hemoptysis, this may cause an even further delay in my obtaining appropriate diagnostics and treatment.",,,,,,,,,U,05/25/2021,06/05/2021,11,,PVT,,"acebutolol 200mg/day, PreserVision AREDS 2  chewable","MAI/MAC, bronchiectasis, mitral, central serous retinopathy","MAI/MAC since 2006, bronchiectasis (02/19/2019 heart calcium CT requires followup lung CT for definitive diagnosis)",,,2,06/14/2021,,,,sulfa drugs (hepatomegaly)

The severity of these symptoms would fluctuate, but they have been present most of the time since then. They made it very difficult to complete my semester at school. A week prior my long-term girlfriend effectively broke up with me, and I had been taking two herbs, Wort and rhodiola, the former for a month and the latter for two weeks at the beginning of symptoms, which I later found out can significantly influence brain chemistry and even induce mania in some individuals. Thus, it seems likely that a combination of these and other factors could have caused the symptoms I am now experiencing, and this is the opinion of the psychiatrist I am currently seeing (listed under doctor to contact). However, given the close timing of my vaccination and subsequent onset of symptoms, I have been worried about whether it could have played a role and wanted to report it.

He reported symptoms onset at 1330 on 6/10/2021 while driving a truck. He also had left sided occipital headache and rested for 1 hour. His symptoms improved after the nap but never resolved completely. He got into a location and rested there for 1 night. In the morning after waking up he was having difficulty chewing food on his left side. He called EMS and was brought to hospital. While in the ED, he received workup including CT Head W/O, CTA Head/Neck with perfusion scan that were all negative. Other labs obtained included BMP, CBC, Troponin x1, Coag studies & CXR which were largely unremarkable. Neurology were called for stroke alert and given ASA 325mg and ordered MRI. Patient's MRI was unremarkable for stroke or masses. He was started on Prednisone 40mg once daily for Facial Nerve Palsy. He was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy, they recommended him go home to family. His symptoms improved after therapies were initiated but are not completely resolved. Patient will continue taking his home medications per his primary care doctor. He will complete a 7 day steroid course, has 3 days remaining. He will take Acyclovir 5 times per day for 10 days. We also gave him lubricating eye drops since he continues to have difficulty closing his left eye.  He spends a lot of time outdoors and works with horses. He reports getting tick bites before in his body but never noticed a rashes. He has never received treatment for Lyme Disease. He is a long-haul truck driver and has driven all around. He reports walking in wooded areas when he stops in the rest area. We obtained Lyme Titers, which were eqivocal for IgM and negative for IgG. Western blot was ordered to rule out Lyme disease. He should followup with PCP for treatment if he is positive. We will call him with results when available.   Of note he received Pfizer 2nd COVID vaccine on 6/9/21 (LOT #EW0178). He reported fever and diarrhea that night and next morning. He then reports having presenting symptoms after 7 hours of driving. We also believe the cause of his facial nerve paralysis could have been a side effect of his vaccination.",,,Y,,Y,3,,Y,Y,06/09/2021,06/10/2021,1,,PVT,,Xigoduo XR 10-1000mg Omeprazole 40mg Dublia Glimental,None,Pericarditis Diabetes Type 2,,,2,06/14/2021,,,,No known drug allergies

Today is June 14.  So, I am writing this report 5 weeks after the last shot, with many of the effects continuing.  I am 64 yr. old male.  I have a history of high blood pressure, which has been controlled successfully with medication for the past 8 years.  I had a hemorrhagic stroke in 2013, successfully recovered.  Otherwise no severe disease-type medical risks, I am health and physically fit.  I live with serious chronic pain from a multitude of factors.   I have severe tendinitis-type problems in my arms and legs; joint stiffness and pain, tight muscle problems.  The vaccine ?attacked? and severely worsened these symptoms.  The night of the vaccination, I started getting serious pain in a number of painful areas ? knees, ankles, elbows and forearms, like inflammation, all at once.  This pain advanced to injuries in prior injured areas, like knees forearms lower legs, and worsened when I would try basic loosening up exercises, to point that I could barely walk for a couple of weeks.  After exercising or loosening up, muscles and joints would tighten up severely, exacerbating pain and function.   I was barely able to walk or do much for a week or more.  I?ve needed extra bodywork and chiropractic sessions to deal with this.  The problem with tendinitis areas is less bad than right after the shot but still significantly worse than it had been before the vaccine.  When exercising, I am slower and able to do less time at cardio functions and have to lift 10-20 lbs. less weight when using weight machines.  I also get joint pain, ala knees when I use exercise bike; knees and shoulders get a certain type of pain (I feel it on the outside of the joint).  These are quantifiable factors.  The joint problems mirror a type of joint problem I had for a couple of years after my stroke, not what I experience every day.  The joint is weaker, and I feel a vague pain like the pain is coming from outside of the joint.   So, the vaccine seems to have ?attacked? and exacerbated problem areas of mine which already affect my ability to function adequately, and it is unclear whether or not these will fully resolve.  It is not a ?one or two-day? thing as suggested.    Additionally, I?ve generally felt drowsiness and ?headachy? during the day since.  These symptoms have lessened, but still there to some extent.  It is unclear whether or not I will fully recover or if anything else is wrong.  I am doubtful that I should take any additional ?booster shots? later if suggested or mandated.

Then they went to the mall and she just started not to feel good, and had a stomach ache, diarrhea and left due to her not feeling well.  That night she just started to feel horrible, and at 6:22 AM was was not feeling well, and had every single symptom of the reactions, brain fog as well.  She also had a fever up to 101.5 at 12:55 PM on 4/1/21.  She progressed to getting sicker, shortness of breath and worsening symptoms with highest temp of 101.7.   On 4/2/21 she started feeling better and her fever was normalizing and had cold sweats, and the initial symptoms of nausea would come and go and still had stomach issues for days afterwards, but the fever did not come back.  Then she started having chest pains, shortness of breath that lasted for 3 weeks afterwards.  She went to the UC on 4/14/21 and vomited again and got concerned that she was still having the chest pains and was getting sicker.  She informed them at the UC that she believed she was having symptoms related to the vaccine and the doctor there had informed her that it could not have been related to the vaccine and ""written off"" and nothing else was said about the vaccine after that.  She never saw a Dr., they did do an EKG and was told that it was normal and was told that she was going to send her to the ER ""as she matters"".   She informed them that she did not want to go to the ER and was informed that she would be seen right away as she was not feeling well enough with the nausea and sick.  The ER was packed and was triaged and they told her that she would be seen and none of that happened.  She supposedly got triaged and had an EKG and was informed that she would be written off about it and that they were making it a political thing.  She had an IV line inserted, and had blood drawn and after 2 hours nothing had been done.  After about 3 1/2 hours being in the ER and after she had made a big fuss and was put in a room.  They sent somebody in and informed her that she had a cardiologist in her family and a GP and if they weren't going to see her to let her go home.  She was then sent in another nurse who was more understanding and he went over the EKG with her and told her that it was strange and said that her heart beat was normal, and then at some point that it skipped a bit and then had a subsequent EKG and that was abnormal as well but in a different way.  Then another nurse came in and told her that they wanted to run tests every hour and never mentioned to admit her, for her to stay in the ER but did not feel they were comfortable sending her home, and that her shortness of breath was concerning to her.  She was progressively feeling worse and was not seen by a cardiologist and they sent her home to FU with one.    She went to see a cardiologist and by then it was documented that there were some people were having heart issues from the vaccine.  He then ordered her an echocardiogram and a stress test, and then did not hear anything from the office.  They had not gotten an authorization from the insurance company and she called her insurance company and they informed them that she was approved and that she is to have an urgent stress test.

After 3-4 minutes, client reported feeling dizzy and EMT1 observed that she was diaphoretic.  Client?s husband was standing next to her and held onto client.  EMT1 grabbed the zero-gravity chair and guided client from her existing chair into the zero-gravity chair.  At 1313 RN2 radioed Lead RN to go to vaccination station 7.  Lead RN arrived at the station at 1312.  Lead RN confirmed with client that she was still feeling a little dizzy, but was beginning to feel better.  EMT provided client with a bottle of water and client was periodically sipping the water.  Client stated that she had eaten and drank plenty prior to being vaccinated.  Client stated she has no known allergies.  Client reported having high blood pressure and epilepsy.

1397510,06/14/2021,CA,74.0,74,,F,,May 18 I received my first Covid Moderna Vaccination.  4 hours later when I went to urinate there was blood on the toilet paper. It only lasted about 3-4 minutes.  2 hours after that I went to the bathroom again to urinate and it burned really bad.  I called my doctor and was able to see her the next morning ( May 19)  She sent my urine in for a culture and it came back as a Urinary Tract Infection. She treated me with Cipro for 3 days. She felt that I should see my GYN regarding the bleeding and felt that it is Post Menopausal Bleeding. I saw my GYN on June 7. She did a Pap Smear and it came back normal but it showed that I have a Bacterial Vaginitis infection and treated me with Metronidazole Vaginal Gel for 5 days. Today June 14 is my last day for that. But when I went to the bathroom to urinate there was some blood again on the toilet paper. I don't know if all this is a coincidence or if this is a reaction to the vaccination. My doctor doesn't think it is a reaction but I want to make sure since I was fine till I was vaccinated. I am concerned because I had no sign of the bleeding or the burning before I got the vaccination. I am also concerned because my next vaccination is tomorrow June 15. If I don't get the second one then is the 1st one not going to be valid. If I do get the second one could I have a worse problem with bleeding and UTI?

It occurred randomly and sporadically across my whole body, but most commonly in the legs. This symptom has continued (intermittently) up to the time of this reporting.  Roughly two weeks after injection (05/01/2021), intermittent muscle weakness and vertigo began. The muscle weakness was primarily in my legs and arms, on both sides, and created a sensation that the limbs were limp/floppy or that the hand/foot was unusually heavy. What I describe as vertigo was not dizziness or the perception of spinning, but rather a sensation of being off-balance or having an unsteady head. When present, the vertigo was triggered by motion of the head (e.g. the motions caused by walking). The muscle weakness is generally worse at night. The vertigo had ceased by 05/30; muscle weakness eventually became persistent, and continues up to the time of this reporting.  An additional symptom that eventually appeared is occasional tensing and soreness of various muscle groups in the legs and arms, as if they have been intensely exercised (but they have in fact not been exercised). This also continues up to the time of this reporting.  On the night of 05/14 through the morning of 05/15, I experienced exceptionally serious muscle weakness and vertigo. The vertigo made it nearly impossible to go to sleep, because the beginning of sleep would trigger a sensation of falling that would cause me to immediately awaken. In the morning, my calf muscles were so weak that it could be difficult to stand up for more than a few minutes at a time, and they would sometimes shake with the effort. These symptoms gradually improved over the course of the following day.  I had additional ""attacks"" on the night of 5/20 through the morning of 05/21, and the night of 05/29 through the morning of 05/30. Again, these led to serious leg weakness that improved gradually during the subsequent day. A persistent low level of leg muscle weakness eventually developed.

Initial report was processed with additional information received on 09-JUN-2021 from a consumer (mother). The patient's weighed 162 pounds and was 6 feet tall; medical history included a few previous headaches, as a young child the patient had nose bleeds and seasonal allergies. He tested allergic to mold and dust (currently very mild if at at); reported as ""otherwise healthy"".

No concomitant medications were reported.  The patient on Sunday evening of 11-APR-2021 after receiving the vaccine had a fever and headache. The fever resolved on the second day but the headache remained at a similar level until Wednesday 14-APR-2021 when it became vice like. He experienced nonstop facial and head pain and pressure. The patient had pain in the bridge of his nose that intensified regularly and pain radiated below his temples, around his ears and has sporadically occurred in other parts of his head. He has had pressure on both temples and elsewhere that felt like a vice although which has subsided.  His mother reported the gnawing pain was difficult for him to deal with.  The patient reported he never had experienced head pain of this type previously.  On 19-APR-2021 the patient received the following laboratory test of a complete blood count as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) (NR: 4 - 11 10*3/mm3) 4.0; red blood cell count (RBC) (NR: (4.0 - 6.2 10*6/mm) 4.72; hemoglobin (HGB) (NR 11 - 18.8 g/dl) 13.8; hematocrit (NR 33-55%) 41; mean cell volume (MCV) (NR: 80 - 100 um3) 87; mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) (NR: 26-24 pg) 29.3; mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (NR:(31.0 - 35 g/dl) 33.6; red cell distribution width (RDW) (NR: (10 - 20 %) 12.6; platelets (PLT) (NR:(150 - 400 10*3/mm) 150. On an unspecified date, laboratory results showed the patient was negative to the Coronavirus. On 21-APR-2021 the patient received a brain magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) without contrast with results of no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, fluid collection, or mass lesions. Mild mucoperiosteal thickening of the paranasal sinus disease. As this was the only clinical indication the physicians felt the patient had a sinus infection and treated him with two different antibiotics which had no effect. A lumbar puncture was not performed. A comprehensive metabolic panel was drawn on 06-MAY-2021 with the significant for the following elevated results: Calcium (NR:8.4 - 10.2 mg/dL) 10.3; total protein (NR: 5.9 - 8.1 g/dL) 9.2; albumin (NR:3.5 - 5.0 g/dL) 5.5.

On 07-MAY-2021 another brain MRI was performed with and without contrast and MRI venogram which showed a normal brain MRI, no cause for headache seen, no sinus thrombosis, no hemorrhage, cerebral edema, mass or acute cortical infarction, there was opacification of the right frontal sinus and bilateral anterior ethmoid sinuses - correlate for sinusitis as a cause for headache.  The Ears, Nose and Throat (ENT) immunology specialist, ruled out a sinus infection and sent him for a CT scan which came back normal (dates unspecified). On 13-MAY-2021 the physician ordered a series of blood work: SARS-CoV-2 IgM Antibody: negative; SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody: negative; Fibrin D-Dimer (NR 0.00-0.49 mg/L FEU) 2.40 (Fibrin D-Dimer elevated); SARS-CoV-2 Semi-Quant Antibody (NR:<0.8 U/mL) 18.2 (therapeutic response decreased).  The physician told the patient his neutralizing antibody was very low about 31% which indicated a minimal antibody response to the vaccine. The physician felt the patient was having an immune response to the adenovirus (immune rejection of the virus which triggered a series of immune reactions and less likely to be reactions to the S protein of COVID. Gabepentin for the pain starting at 100 mg twice a day, increased to 200 mg but the dose did not affect the pain.  The physician recommended the patient receive another vaccine from a different pharmaceutical company once his current symptoms go away.  The physician would then test the patient's antibodies after a first shot to see if he requires a second.  The patient also saw an internist (date unspecified) who stated as the patient was physically a big man, he would need a higher dose of gabepentin and raised the dose to 300 mg three times a day and was later raised to 600 mg three times a day.  The ENT physician then raised gabepentin again to 900 mg three times a day; and informed the patient the pain would go away when his immune system calms down. The ENT also stated that when the patient's pain was gone maybe he should go straight to the booster shot for a vaccine to COVID 19. On an unspecified date, the patient saw a neurologist who said that the patient's events were caused by an immunological reaction to the vaccine; which caused a neurological reaction focused on his face and head.   His mother stated ""the doctors who have seen him all have the belief that his head pain is a reaction to the vaccine."" The mother also reported there were no clinically relevant abnormalities found in the testing. The gabepentin currently has given very little relief from the pain and pressure for the patient, which becomes worse at night. The patient was frustrated that the medications have not really worked and was afraid he won't get ever get better. He occasionally awakens headache free but after 30 minutes the symptoms were back. He has not had a pain free day in 2 months which was affecting his quality of life. No unconventional therapies have been attempted.

The fever resolved on the day 2 but the headache remained at a similar level through day 3 when it became vice-like, associated with persistent facial and head pressure, and nasal bridge pain radiating bitemporally. The patient has also lost 20 pounds since receiving vaccine. The patient underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (without and with contrast) and a computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out blood clots. The results were negative except for findings of some thickening around the nasal area in the MRIs which led two doctors to consider a sinus infection; he was treated with two different antibiotics without relief and the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) immunology specialist ruled out a sinus infection. Labs showed a borderline platelet count of 150,000 and an elevated D dimer (2.4), with no anti-PF4 performed. A lumbar puncture was not performed. The physician felt there may be an allergic reaction to the Adenovirus shell of the vaccine. Gabapentin was initiated at escalating doses with very little relief. A neurologist said that the patient's events were caused by an immunological reaction to the vaccine.

This report concerned a 60 year old male patient of unspecified race and ethnic origin. The objective of this study was prospective analysis of all of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients after 12-JAN-2021 to assess the frequency of worsening ITP symptoms and exacerbation of thrombocytopenia in those who chose to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The duration period of study was between 12-JAN-2021 and 01-MAY-2021. In the study, 52 consecutive patients who received COVID-19 vaccination were identified and followed. The patients were advised to obtain platelet counts 1-7 days before and 3-14 days after vaccination and assessed for exacerbation of their thrombocytopenia and clinical signs of bleeding after vaccination.  The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient's past medical history included splenectomy (had multiple courses of rituximab), and concurrent conditions included immune thrombocytopenia (had since 16 years). The patient had multiple prior severe relapses every 3-5 years often lasted for months. The patient experienced severe relapse of immune thrombocytopenia when treated with meningococcal vaccine for prophylactic vaccination in past. The patient was in complete remission for 3 years. The patient's platelet count prior to vaccination was 270 X 10*9/L.

The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  Five days after the vaccination, the patient experienced a worsened immune thrombocytopenia. The patient had petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis and oral blood blisters. Five days after vaccine, platelets were 7 X 10*9/L with epistaxis. The lowest platelet count after the vaccination was 1 X 10*9/L. The patient was treated with prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab and romiplostim. It had been 33 days until platelet count were greater than 30 X 10*9/L. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Platelet count (NR: not provided) 1 X 10*9/L, 7 X 10*9/L, greater than 30 X 10*9/L, 270 10*9/L.

In conclusion, the results of the study suggested that some patients with ITP might have a transient exacerbation of their thrombocytopenia, some with symptoms, within 1 week of their COVID-19 vaccination. It was recommended that ITP patients should still undergo at least the initial vaccination for COVID-19.

He denied any recent travel any recent illness any recent sick contacts.  He denied any illicit drug use over-the-counter supplement use .patient reported he received his first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 5/17/2021 and a few days after began to feel congestion with mild coughing which progressed.  He initially thought he may be having  allergies and took some Claritin without relief.  As the week went on he developed increasing shortness of breath and cough and also developed a fever.  He went to the well now urgent care on June 3 and was told he may have pulled a muscle and was sent home.  He returned back to our emergency room in the early morning of 6/4 complaining of again of left-sided chest pain radiating into his ribs with associated shortness of breath worse with inspiration associated with coughing but no hemoptysis.  At that time he had no complaints of fever or chills.  He works at a hardware store and thought perhaps he may have strained himself lifting heavy boxes of flooring.  During that ER visit he was hypotensive and tachycardic with respirations of 30.  CTA of the chest did not show any pulmonary emboli but showed inflammatory changes in the left side in the lingula consistent with possible acute community-acquired pneumonia.  He was given Toradol and morphine and was discharged home on oral antibiotics.  His EKG at that time showed sinus tachycardia the ST segments were normal.  He was afebrile.  He returned back to the emergency room the morning of 6/5 with complaints of worsening left-sided chest pain worsening shortness of breath and worsening fatigue.  He reported any movement he develops a cough and he cannot lie flat as he develops significant chest pain which is relieved with sitting up.  He had been taking some ibuprofen with minimal improvement.  He also reported some nausea and fatigue.  He had a fever at home of 102 �F just before coming to the hospital but arrived afebrile.  Patient admitted to having COVID-19 infection in February when his wife tested positive.  He was asymptomatic other than a headache for 1 day and recovered without any incident.  In the ER he was again tachycardic but was afebrile.  His blood pressure was 137/81 his O2 sat was 97% on room air.  He however was quite tachypneic with respirations of 35 at times at rest.  Lab work revealed a white blood cell count of 13.2 with significant elevations of his erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP at 75 and 20.8 respectively.  Covid testing was negative.  Repeat chest imaging reveals a large left pleural effusion and atelectasis with no pulmonary edema.  CT scan of the chest revealed no pulmonary emboli but now reveals right middle lobe and bibasilar infiltrates suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process.    EKG revealed sinus tachycardia but no ST changes were apparent.  Was clinically dehydrated with an elevated specific gravity positive nitrites but 0-9 white blood cells on urinalysis.  Troponin at 0-hour was low -3 1 hour was -3 with no change in his delta.  BNP was normal at 14 lactic acid was normal at 1.1.  Procalcitonin was normal at 0.60 and lipase was normal at 21 with a normal CMP.  He was subsequently admitted to the hospitalist service.  In the emergency room he was given Rocephin and azithromycin. The following day his condition worsened with continued fever and increasing shortness of breath. . ESR was worsened from 75 to 82 and cardiac crp now >200. A stat echo was ordered and his case was reviewed with the cardiologist. there was concern for possible myo/pericarditis so pt was started on colchicine and ibuprofen tid and the decision was made to transfer the patient to a larger tertiary care facility. stat echo showed normal ef and no sign pericardial effusion. He was transferred to another hospital where he was followed by cardiology and pulmonology. He ultimately underwent thorocentesis but the fluid reaccumulated so a chest tube/drain was placed. He was treated for a peripneumonic effusion. cultures and cytology were ultimately negative. acid fast bacilli was negative, blood cultures were negative. covid 19 pcr testing was negative x 2.

I think logically not irrationally.   All I know is I seemed to have have noticeable tinnitus for the first time in my life around the time I received the vaccine.   I will eventually follow up with an audiologist in the near future.

Initially he noted headaches, neuralgia, chills and sweats, and just suspected these would dissipate as had been described in the media.  His headaches and neuralgia did resolve, but he continued to have significant night sweats and fatigue.  He had one episode where he passed out and struck his head.  This has not recurred for over a month.  He has had 2 episodes of vomiting bilious material these were significantly spread out.  He has noted a 20 pound weight loss and difficulty sleeping.  He does report that in the last few days his symptoms seem to have improved, and his appetite has improved as well, but he has not noticed any weight gain yet.  He did have low-grade fevers the highest being in the 101 range.  He had no visual, taste, pulmonary, genitourinary, rheumatological, or dermatological complaints.  Apart from the 2 episodes of vomiting he has had no GI issues.  His wife is present and concurs with his history.  He has had a significant work-up from his primary care provider who included an LDH in late May that was normal, CBC with differential which was benign, a Monospot which was negative, CRP that was elevated at 85 with 0-10 being the reference range, a negative ANA, negative RA, and a sedimentation rate of 42, blood cultures were performed and were negative.

It felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest.  After feeling this extreme discomfort for a few days I began to get worried and decided to go to the Emergency Room to get it checked out.  I went to a hospital. They administered an EKG, took a chest x-ray and drew my blood.   The physician on duty looked at the chest x-ray and told me that my heart wasn't enlarged. He also said it looks like I hadn't had a heart attack.   I suppose my EKG came out normal since they didn't seem alarmed at those results.  My blood panel showed I was a bit low in sodium but otherwise everything was normal.  The next day I felt normal again and haven't felt the chest pressure since. I blame the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for having that feeling of extreme pressure on my chest for several days.

1399169,06/15/2021,FL,65.0,65,,F,,"Shortly after 1st Moderna shot on Mar 2 2021 I had what I thought was an asthma exacerbation. When breathing did not improve with previously prescribed rescue inhaler and daily oral medication, I saw my primary on Mar 26, 2021.  My primary gave me a  nebulizer treatment, prescribed a z-pack and renewed my Albuteral rescue inhaler. I got no relief from those interventions. On Mar 30, 2021 I had my 2nd Moderna vaccination. I walk daily, usually fast paced with moderate-high exertion, but while having difficulty breathing I  walked slowly with light exertion. On Apr 2nd I was on my walk, short of breath, when I experienced pain in my left chest which moved into my left arm. My left arm was tingling then numb. I stopped and rested until the pain went away, maybe 3-4 minutes. I continued walking  back to the car. My arm remained tingling and numb during that time and for about 30 minutes.  I never felt the same level of pain that I did on April 2nd, but I continued to have shortness of breath, felt twinges/pinches and sometime a quick stab in my left chest. I also had some tightness/pressure in my left neck/throat. My blood pressure was also higher than normal for me. I have had a couple of asthma attacks in my life, but my asthma has been well-controlled and any breathing issues were always able to be resolved with my acute inhaler and a Nebulizer treatment. I had never had chest pain. I saw my primary at a first available appointment who set me up with appointments for pulmonary and cardiology. During this period I also was prescribed additional medications; 1 baby aspirin/day; Symbicort; Metoprolol; nitro (if needed for chest pain). My breathing got worse with the Metoproplol after 5 days and I was given Amlodipine instead. My breathing got easier with the change in medication. I found that lying down on my side helped my breathing. I have not been wakened by not being able to breathe during sleep and feel good first thing in the morning. Once I start moving around in the morning I feel shortness of breath during normal activity. Some days are  improved, some days aren't as good. I have been avoiding even moderate exertion so I don't know if I would have chest pain like I experienced on Apr 2nd again. In addition to the shortness of breath I still feel a twinge/pinch in my left chest and a tightness/pressure on my left neck/throat area. My cardio cath Left/Right was performed Jun 14, 2021. There was no sign of any issues with my heart and no sign of pulmonary hypertension. As of this submission on  Jun 15, 2021, I am grateful that there are no problems or concerns with my heart or lungs. I'll follow my doctor's orders to increase exercise and will have a Pulmonary Function Test in July. I was a person who went from being able to walk 3 miles at a fast pace with 100 foot elevation changes within 1/4 mile to having difficulty walking from my kitchen to the bathroom in a matter of weeks. The only anomaly in that time frame was my 2 Moderna vaccine shots.

INDICATION: Headache.   COMPARISON: None   FINDINGS: There is an acute subacute subdural hematoma with mixed density, which may be related   to ongoing hemorrhage, laterally over the left frontotemporal parietal convexity measuring up  to 1.3 cm in maximal transverse diameter, with associated 1.1 cm left right midline shift with  mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. There is a hemorrhagic infarct in the left occipital   lobe involving at least a part of the left posterior cerebral artery vascular territory.  Unable to exclude some ischemia/infarct without hemorrhage in the left thalamus. There may be  intraventricular rupture of the hemorrhage in the left occipital horn, with the left occipital  horn not well-seen due to mass effect from the intervertebral hemorrhage in the left occipital  lobe and associated edema and mass effect. There is subdural hematoma along the posterior falx  in the left parafalcine region measuring up to 0.8 cm in transverse diameter. There is a  smaller subdural hemorrhage in the left tentorium cerebelli probably with minimal if any  extension into the adjacent superior free edge of the right tentorium.   There is an old lacunar infarct with cystic change in the right basal ganglia/capsular region.  There is an old infarct in the right temporal occipital with gliosis and cystic  encephalomalacic change in a saccular dilatation of the posterior right lateral ventricle and  right occipital horn. There is mild to moderate nonspecific patchy chronic periventricular and  deep cerebral white matter vascular disease in bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Slightly  low-lying right cerebellar tonsil is slightly partially related to asymmetric positioning of  the patient's head in the CT gantry and physiologic, in the range of normal, without findings  of Chiari malformation.

1399881,06/15/2021,CA,57.0,57,,M,,"Mild to moderate tinnitus in both ears. Started approx the day after receiving first dose. More noticeable when less background noise. Hear it every day. Not really any changes in symptoms. Within the first two weeks however, I heard occasional and much louder and noticeable bursts of ear ringing that lasted 15-30 seconds. Have not heard that since the first couple of weeks. Now just chronic mild tinnitus, which is currently manageable. I would very much like to get fully vaccinated, but I'm very concerned about receiving the second dose since others I've spoken to who have experienced similar side effects from the first dose have reported worsening on second dose and some indicating their tinnitus becoming unmanageable. I'm very concerned that this condition could become disabling after second dose. I've tried very hard to research this and see if there are any mitigation measures that I could do to prevent worsening of tinnitus on second dose. Only thing I have heard is that I should receive second dose as far as possible from area of side effect, and that my second shot should be in the thigh. I also considered getting one of the other vaccines as the second dose, but they have all had reports of tinnitus, so I don't think that would make a difference. The general medical community has no knowledge of how to help people with this issue and is not accepting that my condition was caused by the vaccine. However, I have NEVER had long term tinnitus. Only rarely in my life, which was short lived, such as after hearing a loud noise. But not like this. While the medical community can debate the cause and effect, I'm fairly confident my reaction was due to the vaccine. People who have Covid also have reported tinnitus, so I imagine this is something to do with the body's immune response. There are MANY more people experiencing this side effect than have reported I am sure. These people would all like to be fully vaccinated (if they have not received the second dose) and this needs to be addressed if we are going to help relieve their hesitancy. The Director for a large regional hospital system in the area told me that my choice is: receiving the second dose and possibly becoming disabled with severe Tinnitus (as side effects experienced on first dose are normally, but not always, worse after second dose of a vaccine) OR getting Covid!!Neither one is a good outcome!!",,,,,,,,,N,03/25/2021,03/26/2021,1,None,PUB,,"Prozac (10 mg/dy); multivitamin; Vit D 3,000 IU/day (4,000 IU total Vit D including multi vitamin supplement), melatonin at 5 mg prior to bedtime (approx 2 times per week)","None.

At the hospital, Initially made NPO and placed on IV fluids in preparation for possible endoscopy. Repeat labs showed stable hemoglobin compared to outside hospital. GI consulted and determined that hematemesis was most likely due to Mallory Weiss tear. Recommended carafate before meals, chloraseptic spray as needed for sore throat, continuing IV Protonix and IV zofran as needed, and gradually advancing her diet. On HD#3, she had another episode of hematemesis after eating solids. Overnight, tolerated liquids and solids without any further episodes of emesis. Tolerated transition from IV to PO meds and maintained hydration off of IV fluids. Due to symptom improvement, GI did not recommend endoscopy at this time and recommended that she be discharged on 1 week course of carafate, 2 month course of omperazole, and zofran as needed with plans for GI follow-up in 1-2 months. Had another episode of hematemesis at home after discharge. Went back to hospital and admitted again. The patient underwent upper endoscopy which showed no source of upper GI bleed.

He checked pupil dilation and noted that there was a slight delay in the left eye. Upon checking with HCP she said she did not notice any significant delay. I was able to have my vision compensated by my right eye. When my right eye vision became compromised. HCP ordered an MRI which showed a moderate to severe sinus infection and was prescribed antibiotics. The antibiotics did not help. On top of the antibiotics, I also took other medications for the sinusitis. I took the antibiotics from 4/14-4/21. After the antibiotics, on the 4/24 I noticed tingling and numbness on my face particularly from the tip of my nose to my chin and in circular area around my mouth. It is random and comes and goes through out the day, Also, on the same night of the numbness I experienced a bout of off balanced feeling and heaviness. It was a drunk feeling but I do not drink. I had 2 occurrences of this.  It went away in the morning I scheduled another appt because both my left and right eye were consistently blurry. The blurriness would get worse with movement and heat. After that appt she referred me to neurology and gave another dose of antibiotics. I took that from 4/19-4/25. Nothing changed after that round of antibiotics I went to the neurology appt on 6/9, they looked at the MRI and basically confirmed that nothing was wring neurologically. They said they did not have any explanation for the symptoms. My husband asked if there was a chance the vaccine could've caused it. They said they've seen some symptoms in patients but there is no way to confirm it was the vaccine.  I am still currently stuck with my loss of vision.

So, when my thumbs did this, I figured, ?perhaps it?s my old injury just flaring up?? But, this time, the hypoesthesia began engulfing my pinky fingers too. I was obviously disturbed; but, I also figured it could simply be stress and carpal tunnel. This continued throughout the month in a mild way. After my 2nd COVID shot (May 4th), the tingly numbness spread to both heels and toes. And in the week following the vaccination, the numbness started to quickly shoot up both of my legs? all the way to the top of my butt cheeks. And finally, even my testicles started feeling tingly and numb.  It got to the point where I could barely handle sitting down for more than 10 minutes.

1400263,06/15/2021,KS,59.0,59,,F,,"On Friday June 4th I visited a friend who informed me that she had just received the Pfizer vaccine. We hugged and spent several hours together during which I ate food that she prepared which included a raw carrot salad.  On Sunday June 6th at 1 pm, I noticed I felt very tired, which is unusual for me. At 4:15 I suddenly noticed a large bump inside my mouth on my right cheek near where my teeth come together.  I went to look in the mirror and saw a large deep purplish red blood blister that was the size and shape of half a marble. I popped it, the blood came out, but otherwise it did not seem to bleed. I put H202 on it, there was no pain. By about June 8th it had almost completely healed leaving only a slightly pinkish circle where it had been. Other than the fact that this was so much larger and so much more spherical than any blood blister I had ever had before (and it's been years since I did -- and they were ALWAYS the result of injuring my cheek -- which had not happened this time.) I didn't think much of it.  Then on Wednesday June 9th 4:08 pm, I suddenly noticed another large bump in the same general area.  I went to look in the mirror and saw another blood blister about the same size and shape of the first one -- but this one was slightly farther back and a tad lower in my mouth compared to the now slightly darker spot where the first one had been.  I popped this one and put H202 on it -- but a lot more blood came out of it -- at least a teaspoon and it just kept bleeding and bleeding. Then it bled several more times again over the next few days as well. It was also very painful. At first there was an inch long piece of loose skin hanging in my mouth -- but after two days, it had disappeared, but the pain continued on. There was a huge raw ulcer more than half an inch long and not quite as tall -- raw and red that would bleed from the slightest touch -- but it was completely flat, I could not feel any lump in my cheek from the inside nor the out. But unlike the first blister, this one just didn't seem to heal, so I started trying different things like gargling with salt water, and applying turmeric powder --- nothing seemed to help at all.  It was the amount of bleeding that caused me to connect this with my having been exposed to my just vaccinated friend -- as I had been hearing from so many others that they experienced prolific bleeding (from nose or vagina) after close contact with a just vaccinated person. And then the fact that this was so bizarre and not like any other event I have ever had. And also the fact that it just didn't seem to heal as fast injuries inside my mouth always have -- and did with the first blister.  It is now nearly a week since I first got the second blister. The circumference has shrunk to the size of a pea, but the middle is still as raw as ever and I am in constant pain, which is pretty alarming. I noticed on the trial protocol that it alludes to the fact that exposures to the vaccine can happen to people who did not get the injection but were exposed to the skin or breath of someone who did. That is what prompted me to file this report",,,,,,,,,N,06/04/2021,06/06/2021,2,,UNK,,"T4. T3 Bacopa, Eleuthero, D3, K2, DHA/EPA, Methyl B-12",none,hypotthyroid,,,2,06/15/2021,,,,

Initial fainting episode was in January 2021 upon receiving sutures the laceration on his his right index finger.  At the time he reports that although he passed out he did not really lose consciousness as he was aware of his surroundings.  Things seem to go fine for a while until the day after he received his J &J vaccine in April 28, 2021.  Reports having the usual post vaccine symptoms such as myalgias and malaise but the following day  while at the barbershop he reports having another syncopal episode.  He reports a prodromal phase that includes shortness of breath, numbness of the lips and a generalized warm feeling.  During this episode he denied any loss of consciousness, as he was able to unlock his phone and respond to the people around him.  He denies any myoclonic movements or jerks.  He denies any postictal symptoms.  Patient has been seen in the ED 3 times within the last week.  On 6/10/2021 while at the base clinic, he reports feeling like he was about to pass out and was brought to the emergency department for further evaluation.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, headaches.  He endorses some chest pain when he lays down flat that is relieved by leaning forward.  He denies any recent illness.  Denies any new medications or changes to his diet or hydration status.    The day prior to admission, his ED visit for weakness and presyncope occurred shortly after PT eval at the base.  He felt very lightheaded and he attributes that to not eating and drinking prior to the PT eval.     Work-up in the ED included EKG which showed ST elevation in leads V3 and V4 in a biphasic pattern.  CT chest which showed no PE or consolidation pneumonia or pleural effusion.  CMP was remarkable for potassium of 3.4 serum bicarbonate of 21.  CBC was normal.  CK was slightly elevated at 913.  Troponin was negative.  Lactic acid was 1.9.  UA with no concern for infectious process.  UDS was negative.  Due to EKG findings reported above, patient was discussed with cardiologist who recommended that patient be admitted for observation.   Upon further discussion with patient, it was clear that his chest discomfort improved when leaning forward, and his EKG was consistent with diffuse ST elevation.  With a clinical diagnosis of acute idiopathic pericarditis, patient was initiated on colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.  He is to continue his colchicine therapy for 3 months and his ibuprofen therapy for 1 to 2 weeks with a gradual de-escalation of that ibuprofen by 200 mg/week.  He has follow-up with cardiology scheduled.  Cardiology mentioned in their notes that they would obtain an echocardiogram to rule out structural heart disease and recommended a 2-week event monitor upon discharge with a 3-week follow-up with tilt table testing and exercise stress testing.  Cardiology had high suspicion for possible vasovagal.

I scratched and thought it would relieve the itch, but it didn't. I looked and noticed there was a welt there. I put on a little cortisone cream, which helped for only about 10 minutes. Afterwards, the itching became more pronounced, so I took 1 Benadryl tablet. It eased the itch a little, so I put on a little more cortisone cream. It got rid of the itch for a little longer. About 2 hours later, the rash became hot to the touch. I took another Benadryl tablet and went to sleep. I woke up at about 4 AM on 3/31, and my legs, left arm, and ankle were itching. It had spread. I took off my bracelets, because they aggravated the itch. I contacted medical center and had an e-visit with on-duty ER doctor about midnight on 4/1. She wasn't sure if my symptoms were caused by the seafood I had eaten earlier or by the COVID vaccination. She recommended i stop eating seafood and that I follow up with my PCP and to make sure I answered every V-safe text I received. She prescribed a steroid cream and oral steroids. She prescribed a 6-day regimen of steroids. After that, my situation improved. The steroids worked and the itching stopped. She urged me to keep my appointment for the second COVID vaccination. Everything cleared up, but then a week later (before the second vaccination), the itching returned on my neck and left arm. Welts and pimples reappeared. The skin was hot to the touch in the affected area. Intermittently, the welts would go down, but the pimples would appear and that was when the itching was especially bad. After that happened, I contacted my PCP by email to update her and assure her I had followed all her recommendations. She had recommended that I see a dermatologist. I had an e-visit with a dermatologist named Dr./MD. I don't remember the exact date, but it was before I received the second COVID vaccination. Dr. wasn't sure if the situation was caused by the seafood or by the vaccination, though he leaned towards the condition being possibly caused by the vaccine. He told me to continue with the Benadryl and he made an appointment for me to see him in person on June 8. He examined me in person that day and said that it looked like it had a bite pattern. He said it wasn't bed bugs, but it was possibly caused by a spider bite. I spend a lot of time outside, and he told me that I could have once been bitten in the past and that the venom could have lain dormant before it manifested its symptoms. He prescribed me clobetascol topic cream and put me on a 12-day regimen of prednisone. This regimen relieved my symptoms within hours. The cream works well on contact.

They resolved within around 48 hours, after a really good night's sleep.  The issue I'm reporting is one that may or may not be connected.  I had been treated for inflammation in my hands and feet, for about two years, which had mostly resolved by December 2020.  My massage therapist told me I was ready to stop treatment and I wasn't taking anti-inflammatory medication.  I had not seen a rheumatologist because my blood work showed no evidence of an autoimmune condition.  Instead, I had been treating my symptoms through physical therapy, massage therapy and OTC anti-inflammatories, with two rounds of steroids.  Following my second Moderna dose, I noticed pain, stiffness and swelling returning to my hands, as well as discomfort in my feet, knees, shoulders and other areas.  The tendons (e.g. flexor tendons in fingers) and tissue are inflamed, not the joints.  At first, I assumed the return of symptoms was merely a coincidence, but over time I began to wonder if the return of inflammation was a response to my immune system being triggered by the second shot.  (I am very grateful for having the vaccine and would get it again, despite my daily physical discomfort.)  I finally discussed my symptoms with my primary care provide, at the beginning of May 2021.  He prescribed a six-day pack of steroids and daily Meloxicam 15-mg.  I have been getting orthopedic massages to treat my hands/arms, for which I have a prescription.  My symptoms were at their peak, during the month of May, once the steroids wore off and my inflammation returned.  There has been some improvement over the past week, specifically less pain and more flexibility in my fingers.  At times, in late May, the symptoms were severe enough that I couldn't braid my hair or pick up a plastic bag of garbage.  I also had difficulty grabbing doorknobs, holding a kitchen knife and completing other tasks that involved grasping or making a fist, because I had difficulty bending some of my fingers and some would briefly lock in a ""trigger"" position.

After 5-10 minutes the pain subsided enough to allow me to continue walking at a slower pace until I reached my destination.

This fluttering would occur after exercise or exertion and eventually I called my doctor about it and was directed to the ER at Hospital. on 5/17/21. An EKG was done which showed irregularities from one done five weeks previously.   I was given a bed and a heart monitor was attached to me.

An ultra sound on my legs and chest area were performed with no blood clots found.  A heart catheterization was done 5/18/21.

She has never had a reaction to a vaccine in the past and she has been able to receive PEG in the past. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Upon follow up on 22Feb2021, it was reported that, she took the first Pfizer COVID vaccine and she had some effects from it. Not anaphylaxis, on 23Jan2021, she had a little bit of swelling in face and this was not immediately, this happened a couple of hours afterwards and pupils got really dilated and then that went away in a couple of hours. And then three days later on 26Jan2021, she came down with muscle weakness and muscle pain and all of that lasted three weeks but she had not concerned about that. She has concerned about is that like the people said that and the face swelling, if you would have looked at me, you would not have known that face was swollen but it was. Her nose was swollen, wrinkles were not there, from the swelling they were opened up."" She went back to get second vaccine and they were hesitant about giving it to because the doctor there said that there was a good possibility that the second dose could give a full blown anaphylaxis reaction. So, they were kind of hesitant about it. So, they made another appointment for 3 weeks later because they said as long as she gets it in 6 weeks, she is still good. But they also told to take a series of blood tests that would tell what level is, the number level and they said as long as it is not falling after 6 weeks then that means she have enough immunity. The way he explained it to was that if you have to put a 100 people in a room and give them the vaccine, considerably they already have 95 percent and the other have lost so that's why she has to get the shot to everybody. So, she had the first test done and result was 108 which was high because 'anything that has 0.79 is positive' (not confirmed appropriately) and she have to get another blood test tomorrow. But she thinks need a little bit direction and also read that the blood test doesn't really tell you how much immunity you have towards the shot. Upon follow up on 25Feb2021, it was reported that getting first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 23Jan2021. 1.5 hours after her dose she had swelling in her face and pupils were dilated. 3 days later she developed severe weakness and muscle pain which lasted for 3 weeks.

This a 58-year-old female consumer (patient) reported for herself that she received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6198) intramuscularly into the left arm (in shoulder area) on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 58-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included asthma, allergies. She does have a tendency to have (for no particular reason), a weakened immune system. She gets sick easy. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EL9269) intramuscularly into the right arm on 11Feb2021 around 11:45-11:50AM (at the age of 58-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation which resulted in traveling tingling, stiffness, stiffness in neck, soreness in her arm at the injection site and shoulder region and tightness in muscle.  On an unspecified date, the patient reported of stiffness and muscle ache that came and went, muscle stiffness in neck, chilled, could not get warm, soreness in the same shoulder the vaccine was given in and fatigued. She had no tingling in her arm with the second dose. She had normal stiffness and muscle ache that came and went. She clarifies the second dose was given in her left arm because she still had muscle stiffness in her neck. Her neck was still tender. She has had this muscle stiffness the whole month. With the second dose, she still had the normal stiffness and soreness in the same shoulder the vaccine was given in. With the second dose, the caller confirms she did get muscle stiffness and soreness in her left arm that goes up into her neck, but she did not have the tingliness. She had the same symptoms again in the arm she received the vaccine in except she didn't have tingliness, just the stiffness. It was definitely a lighter reaction that it was initially. For the next 3 or 4 days, she would wake up feeling okay, and end up by the evening, feeling just like she just went out and walked 10 miles- her muscle were stiff, fatigued, and ached. She also was cold and what she describes as being chilled. She did not have the chills, but she could not get warm. This lasted 3 days after the shot but that stopped. She has been checking her temperature. Time the vaccination was given was right around noon, because she knows she waited afterwards until 12:30 or 12:33 or 12:34. She had muscle pains and her neck was still bothering her. She definitely still had stiffness in her neck and muscle going from shoulder to neck. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Treatment included Tylenol Extra strength both times. She does occasionally take Advil sinus for her sinus conditions. However, she was told to not take Advil within 2 weeks of the vaccine so she didn't have any. She may have taken Loratadine or something like that, something minor. Maybe a Tylenol Sinus for allergy related stuff. The patient did not care to go and do the V-Safe and have it tracked. She knew someone that did but she was not sure if it was one with Pfizer or what but she did not want to be annoyed with it and was told it asks questions every day and all sorts of stuff. She had allergies and she knew she could get a reaction, so it was not alarming and not a big deal when she got one. She was 57 or 58, she believes she was 58 and commented that her brain was not working. Once you get past 50, you do not count and feel old. She explains after the first dose, she ended up staying at the vaccine facility for about 45 minutes. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, the arm that the shot was given in, started to feel tingly and stiffness. This kind of stiffness went to her fingers. Her arm did not go completely stiff. It was traveling, tingling and stiffness and tightness in her muscle. This did go up into the muscle that goes up into neck, she does not know what muscle that is. It was the muscle that goes up and makes you have a stiff neck if you sleep wrong. Stiffness in her neck was on the same side, clarified later as the right side. This was within the first 10 minutes after the shot and lasted about 20-25 minutes or however long it was past the half hour she had to wait. She stated she know once she reached the half hour point, it was still getting a little bit worse but not much. She waited another 15 minute and by then it had gotten a little better, so she left. She explains with the initial dose and after having the reaction, a nurse came and asked her a bunch of questions and checked her temperature. The nurse kept offering her Benadryl but she declined because she knows Benadryl makes her extremely sleepy. She has asthma and allergies, so she did have an EpiPen and inhaler in case needed for an emergency. She did not use anything and did not take the Benadryl. Contacted her allergist and the allergist said it made sense to them and to continue to monitor what was going on. The stiffness and muscle aches in that arm continued in the same side that whole day and went down into her leg, but it was not bad on her leg. Her leg felt stiff but she would not have noticed the stiffness if it was in both sides. She could tell one leg (right leg) felt funny and the other did not. The tingliness went away within an hour or two. She had what she calls normal vaccination soreness in her arm at the injection site and shoulder region. She did take tylenol, she was advised not to take Advil or anything else. She had no problems the next day. The muscle soreness came back the second night after receiving the first vaccine. She was not at all concerned, she was only reporting this today because she knows little was known and she figured it needed to be and it was good information to have. She does have a history of having shoulder surgery. She has had frozen shoulders in both shoulders within the last 5 years. She has massage therapist and the massage therapist theory is that it goes to where your body is normally weak. No investigation assessment.

The patient's concurrent conditions included well controlled bipolar depression and comorbid attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder. The patient's concomitant medications included buspirone, lurasidone, oxcarbazepine and trazodone, all for bipolar depression and lisdexamfetamine for comorbid attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder.  On an unspecified date, two weeks earlier, the patient's depression was in full remission and she had scored 0 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).   On an unknown date, a week before coming to clinic, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; dose, route of administration, indication and anatomical location: not reported). The batch number was not reported.   On the same day, within a couple of hours after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient started feeling depressed and became tearful. These symptoms were followed a couple of days later with aches and pains, which escalated over the subsequent days. She complained of joint pain, burning pains in her small joints and myalgia, and rated her pain as 6/10.   On an unspecified date, two weeks after her clinic visit, the patient returned to the clinic for an urgent, unscheduled visit due to escalating depression, which was rated as 18/27 on the PHQ-9 (a score of 15-19 was considered moderately severe). The patient also noticed ringing in her ears for the previous two days. On the assumption that patient's relapse of depression was related to an immune response, physicians agreed to a trial of celecoxib at dose of 200 mg twice a day and she was asked to return in a week if her condition did not improve.   On an unknown date, the patient started treatment with celecoxib for relapse of bipolar depression.   On an unknown date, the patient's depression resolved when treated with celecoxib.  On an unknown date, eight weeks later, the patient returned to clinic for a previously scheduled appointment and reported having experienced a dramatic response to celecoxib. Her depression had remitted rapidly, and she scored 0/27 on the PHQ-9. The patient reported an additional benefit of improved interpersonal interactions.   The outcome of 'pain', joint pain and myalgia was not reported.   The author assessed the event of bipolar depression as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, while the causality for other events was not provided. Physicians discussed the possibility that patient's depression might be a reaction to the flu vaccine. On the assumption that her relapse of depression was related to an immune response they agreed to a trial of celecoxib. Should bipolar patients experience vaccination-induced relapse of depression, adding celecoxib to their treatment regimen could be helpful.  The event of bipolar depression was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.   Company comment: A 49-year-old, female patient with medical history of well controlled bipolar depression and comorbid attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. On the same day, within a couple of hours after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient started feeling depressed and became tearful. These symptoms were followed a couple of days later with aches and pains, which escalated over the subsequent days. She complained of joint pain, burning pains in her small joints and myalgia. On an unspecified date, two weeks after her clinic visit, the patient returned to the clinic for an urgent, unscheduled visit due to escalating depression. The patient also noticed ringing in her ears. On the assumption that patient's relapse of depression was related to an immune response, physicians agreed to a trial of celecoxib at dose of 200 mg twice a day.

On the assumption that her relapse of depression was related to an immune response they agreed to a trial of celecoxib. Should bipolar patients experience vaccination-induced relapse of depression, adding celecoxib to their treatment regimen could be helpful.; Sender's Comments: A 49-year-old, female patient with medical history of well controlled bipolar depression and comorbid attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. On the same day, within a couple of hours after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient started feeling depressed and became tearful. These symptoms were followed a couple of days later with aches and pains, which escalated over the subsequent days. She complained of joint pain, burning pains in her small joints and myalgia. On an unspecified date, two weeks after her clinic visit, the patient returned to the clinic for an urgent, unscheduled visit due to escalating depression. The patient also noticed ringing in her ears. On the assumption that patient's relapse of depression was related to an immune response, physicians agreed to a trial of celecoxib at dose of 200 mg twice a day. The patient's concomitant medications included buspirone, lurasidone, oxcarbazepine and trazodone.

I had a bit of a sore arm after the TDAP and the first COVID-19 vaccination but that was it. I didn't even have a sore arm really at all after the second COVID-19 shot. I did have a bandaid mark that lingered for a few days after the second COVID-19 shot but that was it.  I was 30 weeks and 6 days pregnant during the first COVID-19 shot. I felt the baby kicking normally after that and had normal follow up appointments after that too. My entire pregnancy was completely normal (this was my first pregnancy) with no complications or issues. I felt great throughout the entire pregnancy and was active biking, working out, walking, etc. I would consider myself a very healthy and active person and I followed all of the pregnancy ""guidelines"" in terms of what to eat, what not to eat, etc.  The adverse event here is the fact that my baby was stillborn at 39 weeks and 4 days. The appointment with the doctor the week before was totally normal too. What the doctor *thinks* happened is that my amniotic fluid somehow disappeared in the final few days before going into labor (they don't know where it went - my water did not break prior to the delivery of the baby) and the lack of fluid caused the baby to pass meconium. The high level of meconium surrounding her and the amount of time she was exposed to it seem to have degraded the umbilical cord, affecting her oxygen flow. By the time I went into labor, she may have already been dead, though I did not know it. When I got to the hospital in labor, there was already no heartbeat.  Baby delivery date: 5/26/21 Weight: 6 lbs 9 oz Length: 21 in  The mystery here is why was there suddenly a lack of fluid and why did that cause her to pass so much meconium? The doctors do not know and there does not seem to be a way to share this information with other doctors or facilities to gain a better understanding.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/26/2021,05/25/2021,60,Autopsy of the baby Blood tests of both parents,PUB,,Pre-natal vitamin,None,None,,,2,06/16/2021,,,,None

Testing showed existing crowded optic nerve (previously undiagnosed), swelling of the optic nerve, delayed blood flow to optic nerve, and leakage around optic nerve head.  Vision loss progressed over about five days, stabilized, and may now be somewhat improved.  Diagnosis is Non-Arteric Ischemic Optic Neuritis (NAION), for which there is no treatment and uncertain prognosis.  Some extent of permanent vision loss tis epected.  Concurrent rapid onset of hypertension (systolic 150s-170s; diastolic low 100s at times) and fluctuating rapid pulse (80s-110). Currently being treated for hypertension but not yet fully controlled.  Blood tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (high C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate and positive ANA.  Follow-up tests to determine cause of hypertension are underway.  Thus far, no heart abnormalities, no carotid artery blockage, and negative for a number of autoimmune disorders and other possible causes.  Prior to this event, blood pressure and pulse were normal and eye exams showed no vision or retina problems, glaucoma, or macular degeneration.  Cardiologist and rheumatologist have not ruled out inflammatory response to Covid vaccine, have encouraged reporting of this event to VAERS, and have advised against taking any other Covid booster.   Note that the optometrist who first saw me when the vision loss began has since told me that he saw only two cases of NAION in 38 years of practice before mine, but has seen two more besides me in the last couple of months.

1402623,06/16/2021,WA,27.0,27,,F,,"Post COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Patient felt pressured by her work to get the vaccine for COVID-19 and on Thursday, 27 May 2021, patient decided to get the vaccine. She went to a mass vaccination site and within 5 minutes of receiving patient started to ""feel weird."" She reports that will in the observation line her throat felt heavy, so that talking was fatiguing. While in the observation line they checked her blood pressure and respiration. Per her report, her BP norm, breathing not restricted. It was recommended that she call EMS to have Benadryl administered. Patient declined at this point and decided to do this herself. Patient decided to drive herself to the ER. As I drove the numbness spread to behind my eyes, under cheek bones, jaw, back third of tongue, arms and joints including wrists and knees. Small turns along the way in the car would shift my proprioception and cause nausea, my response time was slower. I decided to stop by my house, get an ER go bag and then head to ER. By the time I got to ER I felt numbness in the back of my head and at base cervical spine worsened by rotation. As well as lower spine, non muscular. Getting out of the car I realized my walking was extremely slow, despite my best attempts to walk at a regular speed, it felt like walking in a pool. I checked in and told them mild anaphylaxis. I know they have a lot of people coming in and saying they have had a bad reaction to the vaccine when their arm hurts or they have mild cold symptoms, I didn?t have time to be perceived that way because I could feel my cognition changing rapidly. I realized talking with the check in lady that my ability to talk had changed, my cognition was significantly slower than half speed of normal and I was having word finding issues leaving me with simple sentences taking up to 20 seconds. In the car while using voice dictation to update my mom I remember the heaviness in my throat was getting worse making swallowing challenging. I was checked in pretty quickly. I knew what I wanted to say but the delivery was hard, I felt sabotaged neurally. They brought me right back. Attending ER doc was not phased in the slighted. Blood test panel looked normal, I sat in the ER chair there for two hours. I wonder if they just decided to wait it out. He ultimately came to me and said that I was probably fine, that everything looked normal that he could check. He asked me to walk for him and I needed to grasp his hand so hard just to get up, and then proceed to barely take steps because of how slow and off balance I was. He told me I?m likely allergic to the vaccine, he?s not seen a response like mine. That I should go home and wait it out. And that they have no treatment plan for adverse reactions at this time. I asked if Benadryl or some type of antihistamine was was wise and he dismissed the idea, I was surprised by that. When I left I felt a little better when I left in terms of numbness but was very slow getting out to the car. Since then I have had the numbness return in waves. I went to work the following day, made myself. It was hard, I started to notice things like processing the laundry in the back room, completely overwhelming me eye-to-brain, the laundry visually looked so busy and overwhelming, I had to leave the room due to a small surge in nausea x vertigo type of feeling. Looking at my computer screen and charting elicited the same response, to a lesser degree. I got home and it became much worse throughout the evening. I ended up cancelling my Friday, I know you know that?s a big deal for me.  Since then I have lost my appetite, have been sleeping from 11pm-1pm (since Friday, so two days in a row now). When I look around with my eyes this affects the proprioception and dizziness. I?m still pretty slow and weak. My parents took my laundry yesterday knowing I couldn?t do it. I cleaned my kitchen and showered and ended up paying for it the rest of the day with jaw joint numbness (made worse by chewing, does help with the appetite problem, as I eat I get neurally tired in my jaw with the numbness and just don't want to continue) and behind eye numbness returning as well as feeling like my head is on a slow off-kilter rotation around C1 like a slow motion bobble head (vertigo?). I?m also not emotionally myself and even had an argument with my parents which is unusual these days (I'm glad I can say that). After they left not an hour later, their visit started to fade so drastically in my memory I wasn?t sure how long they were here and even started to notice missing prices or gaps in memory of what happened while they were here (they were there for around two hrs).",,,,,,,,,N,05/27/2021,05/27/2021,0,CBC with differential ESR CMP TSH with free T3 and free T4 GM1 IgM Autoantibodies GM1 IgG Autoantibodies CK total + isoenzymes,OTH,,Prescription medications:  None Supplements:  Unknown,No prior illnesses,Endometriosis,,,2,06/16/2021,,Y,Y,NKDA

The rash appeared on my chest at 28 weeks pregnant. 11 days after my 2nd pfizer dose and 3 days after the small rash appeared on my chest, on May 28, 2021, i went to an obgyn appointment and received 2 more vaccines: a RhoGAM shot in my butt (I have type O- blood) and a Tdap vaccine in my left arm -- both routine shots to get at 28 weeks of pregnancy. 3 days after those shots were administered, on May 31, a rash appeared on my right upper arm area. By June 2nd (16 days after 2nd pfizer and 5 days after tdap and rhogam) the rash on my arm and chest intensified, and i had bumps and rash forming in small patches on my stomach, legs, and neck/jawline. The rash was extremely itchy and uncomfortable. It seemed to spread very rapidly if it was touched. It looked like bug bites at first but would quickly spread into larger patches. I was unable to do regular things like exercise and wear regular clothes or use my regular products on my skin. On June 3rd I saw a dermatologist who prescribed me an antihistimine pill and a steroid cream,, and who said it might have just been a rash that happens sometimes to pregnant women, but perhaps the vaccines were involved. She said the rash could be ""Atopic Eruption of Pregnancy (AEP)."" I also saw my obgyn on June 7, and she also took a look at the rash. With the help of the steroid cream and the antihistimine pill, the rash stopped spreading by June 8 and stopped icthing and irritating me by June 11. It is now June 16 and the rash is starting to fade. I am now 31 weeks pregnant.",,,,,,,,,Y,05/17/2021,05/30/2021,13,,OTH,,"Prenatal vitamins, probiotics",none,none,,,2,06/16/2021,,Y,,none

I kept asking my husband and son if I looked okay because I just felt really bad. I thought it was maybe a really bad migraine but I had never had a migraine that bad before. I tried to go about my day and drive my son to school By the time I got him to school I was a lot worse. On the way home I got lost coming home because I could not see anything in my left peripheral vision field. Since I got lost, I approached my house from the left. Coming into my driveway from the left meant I could not see so I hit my husbands truck. I had very choppy movements with my legs. I told my husband something was seriously wrong and when he looked at me my entire left side of my face was drooping At that point we went to the hospital. At the hospital I was brought in as a potential stroke I was given a CAT scan and tons of blood works. I was admitted for observation to monitor my heart because my symptoms were so similar to a stroke. An MRI showed that I did in fact have a stroke. I was given atorvastatin 40mg and 80mg aspirin I was in the hospital about a day. At that time a lot of mobility on my left side came back. My peripheral vision came back extremely slow. When I came home I took the week off from work. I followed up with my PCP and neurologist. The neurologist put me on 243mg aspirin and atorvastatin. Since the stroke I've had a really bad headache. I also followed up with a cardiologist who put a heart monito on me for a month. They could not find anything, so I am to follow up with them in 6 months. At this time I am being treated for chronic headaches/migraine. I have noticed that I have weird carpal tunnel symptoms in both hands. I followed up with a hand specialist who informed me that a lot of patients she's seen have had the same issue. I have never had carpal tunnel before so it is strange for me seeing that I have been out of work since February. It is still unknown as to what caused the stroke. I do not have high blood pressure, I did a normal MRI and then an MRV with contrast to make sure that blood flow to my brain was correct. Everything came back normal. The only thing that was different within that month of February was the vaccine. I also am experiencing short term memory loss but I believe it is more of a stroke symptom rather than it being due to the vaccine.

That evening, he developed fevers, chills and had trouble sleeping. On Thursday, he began feeling heart palpitations and again slept. Overnight, he developed midline chest pain, and decided to present to the emergency room. His EKG showed elevated ST segments. Labs were remarkable for elevated troponin, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP; echo showed normal function but subtle hypokinesis of the apex. He was given morphine, Tylenol, Ketorolac, 1L NS, and possibly aspirin before being transferred to the ED.   In our ED, he had a reassuring exam, was no longer reporting chest pain. He had labs drawn which showed a white count to 15.3, normal H/H, Plt 152, ESR 12, CRP 10, and Trop T 1.14.   Aside from the above symptoms, he has been in his usual well state without viral symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, joint pain, or other symptoms. He has no past medical or surgical history. Immunizations are up to date. His social history is benign.  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. An echocardiogram was performed which showed mild LV systolic dysfunction. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV q12h. He remained asymptomatic with no chest pain throughout his admission. He was transitioned over to PO steroids on 6/13 which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down. Cardiac MRI showed an area of late gadolinium enhancement in the LV, with no abnormal function.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake including tolerance of PO steroid. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology to be arranged. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Prednisone  - Famotidine Patient was admitted for management of myocarditis thought to be due to his SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He received IVIG and steroids. He had multiple EKGs, echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI. He showed improvement during his hospitalization.

He was in his usual state of health until he received the second dose of the Pfizer/BNT SARS-CoV2 vaccination on Thursday 6/10. Shortly after and into the following day, he developed fatigue, chills, and a headache, which resolved within 24 hours. However, early this morning at around 2am, he awoke with sharp central chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, radiating to his left, prompting him to present to the ED.  Initially presented to Hospital ED. Vitals stable. Labs notable for troponin 0.07 and d-dimer 1.48. EKG with sinus rhythm, ST elevation in inferior leads. Given ibuprofen 600mg and contacted Cardiology, who recommended transfer to another ED for echocardiogram and further evaluation.  Here in the ED, vital stable, exam non-focal. Labs notable for troponin 0.13 and CRP 3.0; CBC, chem 10, LFTs, BNP, all within normal limits. CXR normal. Echo done which showed normal function (prelim read). Seen by ID who recommended standard workup for vaccine-induced myocarditis. He was admitted to the floor in stable condition.  Hospital Course: Due to rising troponin during hospital day 1 (peak 0.23), patient was treated with IVIG 2 g/kg (6/14) and methylprednisone 30 mg BID (6/14 - 6/15). On 6/15 a cardiac MRI was obtained that showed a small area of late gadolinium enhancement of the LV with normal function.  Troponin was trended every 12 hours and had decreased to 0.11 on 6/15 AM. He was transitioned to oral prednisone 30 mg BID to complete a total steroid course of 5 days (6/14 - 6/18). During admission he was found to be EBV PCR positive with all other viral testing including EBV serologies pending. It is still thought this is likely due to post-vaccine inflammation and not viral myocarditis but serologies should be followed up as outpatient.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.

She could not clarify if it was down from the tip of her shoulder, but said it was about a hand width, or maybe 3 or fingers down from the clip in her bra strap.

I told her it may have been given in a muscle or in the subcutaneous or fatty part of her arm, I could not tell from her story.  She could not clarify.  I explained that it is best if this shot goes in a muscle, but if it goes into the subcutaneous tissue, it is still effective, so it would not have to be repeated.  I asked if this shot was her first shot for shingles, and she said yes.  I told her she only needed one more.
