They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.,,,Y,,Y,2,,,N,02/08/2021,02/08/2021,0,See above,OTH,,Clonidine 0.2mg patch weekly Plavix 75mg daily  Paxil 20mg daily  Lipitor 10mg daily Protonix 40mg daily,Unknown,Dementia  Functional quadriplegia (ADL dependent) HTN H/O CVA with right sided weakness TIAs HLD H/O breast cancer,,,2,02/11/2021,,,,NKDA

The chest pressure worsened when reclined so it was very difficult to fall asleep.  It got too uncomfortable to lay down so I had to keep getting up to walk around to feel better during the night.

Next morning pressure still there but not as bad because I was up walking around more. Always worse whenever reclined or in bed laying down.  It was very uncomfortable at the end of exhaling big or at the end of a large inhale.  I did not feel comfortable exerting myself aerobically.  As the day progressed it got a little better.

He stated that he received the Pfizer vaccine on the 5th and the second on the 26th. He was asking if there were any reports of erectile dysfunction after receiving the vaccine. He also asked if the ingredient Hexane was a poison, if this is safe. The patient had some questions, he is really worried because he has seemed to be experiencing something. He is wondering if Erectile Dysfunction has been reported as a problem from the COVID vaccine. He seemed to be experiencing worsening of his sexual function, and the only thing that is new that he can think, is that he got the vaccination. He received the second dose of the product on 26Jan2021. He asked how long the MRNA last in your system,  how many people were involved in the study, When did it start, if the hexane solvent in the vaccine affect your testes. It was further reported that he was having a bad reaction he believe to the vaccination (Covid Vaccine) and asked if there were any reports of erectile dysfunction or sexual dysfunction regarding males from the vaccine. The patient had an article here it says your system mounts a response against the new protein, because they are seen as foreign invaders, developing antibodies that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 in the process. These infection fighters tick around to help your body fight a future case of Covid-19 but it's not yet understood for how long and this is the sense he wanted to talk to about that body will do its thing and eventually will get rid of the protein or mRNA on its own? The patient said since he had taken the COVID-19 Vaccine injections he has experienced worsening erective dysfunction. He asked if anyone else has reported having that issue since receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. He was advised he would be transferred to Medical Information for further assistance. He stated he is so sad, and started crying while speaking with the agent. He declined to answer any further questions and asked to be transferred to Medical Information to have his question addressed. He asked the agent if she knew that Hexane is in the Pfizer COVID- 19 Vaccine. He said he did not realize Hexane was in the COVID-19 Vaccine before he got the vaccine.

Information on the Pt's concurrent conditions, medical history or concomitant therapy was not reported.   On 17-AUG-2012, the Pt was vaccinated with a first dose of GARDASIL (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). On an unknown date in August 2012, reported as almost immediately, Pt experienced a seizure-like episode which included a staring spell, facial swelling, slurred speech and severe headache. Within a few days of receiving her first dosage of GARDASIL, the Pt developed migraines, dizziness, and numbness. Over the following months, she also experienced constant headaches and severe migraines, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat and palpitations, insomnia, and symptoms of auditory hallucinations and parasomnias. On an unknown date in February 2013, the Pt empierced a seizure and was taken to the emergency department at a hospital. A head CT was performed and returned normal, and she was diagnosed with a first-time seizure. On an unknown date in March 2013, after suffering from headaches, vomiting, and nausea for about five days, the Pt was taken to the hospital for a DHE protocol. Although the protocol resolved her nausea and vomiting, the Pt continued to have migraines and occasional hallucinations. On an unknown date in April 2014 (reported as in April/May of 2014), the Pt began to experience irregular menstrual problems, including heavy bleeding at the beginning of each cycle. After six months of suffering, the Pt's mother made an appointment for a consultation with a pediatrician. On 21-OCT-2014, the Pt was administered with the second dose of GARDASIL, by a physician. On 23-OCT-2014, the Pt collapsed at school while running in her P.E. class and was taken to the ED. By an unknown date in December 2014 (also reported as early December 2014), the Pt's menstrual problems had changed to an absence of menses and severe abdominal pain. An ultrasound performed on an unknown date in March 2015, showed that she had a hemorrhagic cyst in her right ovary and large Nabothian cysts in her cervix. Further testing indicated that the cysts were getting larger, and as the Pt was in constant pain, she decided to have the cyst on her ovary surgically removed. On unknown dates in May and June 2015, Pt experienced several more seizures and was taken to the hospital each time. As the months progressed, so did the Pt's injuries. She was seen by multiple physicians and specialists for complaints, which included, among others: constant nausea and abdominal pain; reflux and heartburn; multiple seizures; feeling faint and lightheaded; heart rate irregularities and palpitations; chest pains; dizziness and blurry vision; dyspnea with walking; significant fatigue; continued menstrual irregularities; joint hypermobility; hives and facial flushing; severe food allergies; chronic dehydration; and recurring ovarian cysts.  As a result of her GARDASIL symptoms, Pt had been unable to engage in the normal activities that a teenager and young adult would enjoy. As a result of her GARDASIL induced injuries, she had to drop out of high school to complete her schooling at home. She was unable to hold down a job for any significant amount of time due to chronic pain and poor health. Pt could not drive a car because of the risks of fainting or having a seizure while driving.  Pt was once a happy child, but as a result of her GARDASIL symptoms, she had experienced a significant decline in her mental health. Due to the significant stressors related to her physical illnesses, she experienced hallucinations and sustained severe emotional distress which led to her cutting herself as a young teenager (dates unknown).  Pt suffered from recurring ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and early onset menopause. She did not get regular periods, therefore would not be able to conceive naturally in the future. She had a high risk for seizure, stroke, heart attack and blood clots and was medically unable to undergo hormone therapy to relieve the pain from the ovarian cysts, or to restore her menses. Therefore, she must live with the chronic, debilitating pain from the recurring cysts, and have them surgically removed when necessary. To date, Pt has had four or more surgeries to remove ovarian cysts.  Based on her chronic and severe GARDASIL symptoms and adverse events as outlined above and the tests performed by a number of medical providers, Pt had been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to, dysautonomia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (""POTS""), orthostatic intolerance (""OI""), mast cell activation syndrome (""MCAS""), complex migraine headaches, seizure disorder, vasculitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, endometriosis, and interstitial cystitis.  Pt contended that her injections of GARDASIL, individually or in combination, caused her to develop serious and debilitating injuries, including but not limited to, dysautonomia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (""""OTS""), orthostatic intolerance (""OI""), mast cell activation syndrome (""MCAS""), complex migraine headaches, seizure disorder, vasculitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, endometriosis, and interstitial cystitis, as well as a constellation of adverse symptoms, complications, and injuries, many of which are alleged herein and all of which were caused by GARDASIL or otherwise linked to her GARDASIL-induced autoimmune disorder.  As a proximate result of Company's wrongful acts and omissions and its negligent and fraudulent testing, labeling, manufacturing, marketing and promotion of GARDASIL, Pt had suffered and continued to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries and associated symptomology and had suffered severe and permanent emotional injuries, including pain and suffering. Pt also had a substantial fear of suffering additional and ongoing harms, including but not limited to now being at an increased risk of cancer and future symptoms and harms associated with her autoimmune disease and other injuries caused by GARDASIL.  As a direct and proximate result of her GARDASIL-induced injuries, Pt had suffered and continued to suffer economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, and diminished in come capacity, and he will continue to incur these losses and expenses in the future.  The outcome of the events was reported as not recovered. The reporter considered all events to be disabling and related to GARDASIL.  Information regarding this Pt was also received via social media. It was reported that on 17-AUG-2012, the Pt was vaccinated with GARDASIL. On 18-AUG-2012, also reported as one day after the first injection, Pt had an epileptic episode that included a ""gaze spell"", swelling of the face, slurred speech and severe headache. She later developed severe migraines, abdominal pain, and a host of other debilitating health problems. On an unknown date in January 2013, also reported as five months after her first injection, Pt had an epileptic seizure and was taken to the emergency room. At that time, she was also facing irregular menstrual problems, including heavy bleeding at the start of each cycle. Her health continued to deteriorate after receiving another dose of the GARDASIL. Just two days after the second injection, Pt collapsed during physical education class and was rushed to the emergency department of a hospital. Pt has had at least one surgery per year on her reproductive organs since she was 15-year-old. Doctors said she would not be able to get pregnant or consider in vitro fertilization. The Pt's clinical diagnoses included dysautonomia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (""POTS""), orthostatic intolerance (""OI""), small fiber neuropathy (""SNF""), neuropathy, mast cell activation syndrome (""MCAS""), seizure disorders and endometriosis. among others. Due to these and other sequelae, Pt was unable to maintain a job for a significant period of time. She also could not drive due to the risk of fainting or seizures while driving. The outcome of the events was reported as not recovered. The reporter considered all events to be disabling and related to GARDASIL.  Upon internal review, the events of mast cell activation syndrome (""""MCAS""), seizure-like episode/seizure disorder/first time seizure, Epileptic episode, hemorrhagic cyst in her right ovary, recurring ovarian cysts, symptoms of auditory hallucinations, cutting herself and neuropathy) were considered to be medically significant .",,,,,,,,Y,N,08/17/2012,08/01/2012,,,OTH,,,,,,US0095075132102USA001836,2,02/12/2021,,Y,Y,

It was unknown if the reporter considered the infection, tingling, nerve pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache and inability to work to be related to Shingrix.

The patient experienced severe headache, tingling along the trigeminal nerve, tingling started at the neck and going up to the head, fatigue and myalgia. The reporter went to the emergency room 4 or 5 times, as well as s her primary care physician, who referred her to infectious diseases.  The patient was unable to work for approximately 4 months due to symptoms.  All symptoms were resolved with the exception of occasional tingling behind the ear. The patient had not yet received the second dose of Shingrix. The reporter asked timeline between getting a vaccine because that was when a lot of people really find out about the shingles vaccine was once they had it and then they need to know how long they need to wait after active infection to get the vaccine.  There were no studies on if you only went for one dose, would you have been any protection at all. The reason for not getting the second dose could have been the physician said no, because of the bad reaction.

Felt fine most of that day other than my arm being sore, which improved with Ibuprofen.  The following day, I woke up a little achy, but felt better after taking more Ibuprofen.  Around 4-5pm on Sunday afternoon, I started feeling more achy with cold chills (highest temp was 99.5) and congestion.  I would take Ibuprofen and Tylenol, which would help.  On Monday, congestion continued, but the body aches and cold chills went away.   I did feel a little tired, but also did not sleep well due to the congestion.  Did not have any other symptoms other than the congestion and actually felt pretty good.  I worked from home on Monday to be on the safe side.   On Tuesday, I was still having congestion (still no other symptoms) and my work did not want me to return until I got checked by a doctor or get a negative covid test.  Went to an urgent care where I was seen by a doctor and tested for covid (rapid test), which came back positive.  The only other symptom that developed was loss of smell (but not sure if that was just due to the congestion -- it seemed to come and go.  Some things I could smell, some things I couldn't).  I did not lose my sense of test.  The congestion lasted less than a week.  My family quarantined for over 20 days.  We tried our best, but it was hard to isolate myself, especially from my younger kids.  No one else in the household ever developed any symptoms.

I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.

I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.

He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm.

His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient's work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

I bled a lot when it was administered and the doctor commented ?Oh, do you normally bleed this much when you get vaccines?? I don?t. I later noted that the location of my shot was very high up on my arm, which I later learned is cause of my injury. Within a couple hours after the shot, my shoulder was very sore. By 9pm, the pain was so severe that I could not use my arm at all. The pain was excruciating for the next few days and then eventually peaked. I have had ongoing varying degrees of pain ever since.   I have pain in my right shoulder and right bicep area. The pain is dull when not using my arm, and sharp when I perform certain movements like trying to reach up high, rotating my arm outward and bringing it across my chest. Sleeping is extremely difficult, and I wake up from pain with even a slight movement. I cannot sleep on the affected side at all.  I started physical therapy on October 27, 2020. After four PT sessions, I had not seen any improvement. I decided to discontinue PT because I decided to seek alternative treatment with Dr., plus I did not feel comfortable being in an enclosed space with multiple people given the high numbers of Covid.  I received a steroid injection into my shoulder on December 16, 2020, which did not do anything to alleviate my pain.  On February 5, 2021 I underwent a new procedure with Dr. He used a Tenex device to ?clean out? the affected areas. I?m still waiting to see how/if my injury heals.

At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist's answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.

I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference ""physical"" with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.

By now I am very uncomfortable with my ankles and the tops of my feet are inflamed, the itch is too severe and the hydrocortisone is not working. I scratched my ankles in my sleep and I really tore them up. The infection continued to progress into the next day. Now my ankles are very puffy and swollen, the blisters have popped, they are no longer pink, they are a dark ""beet"" red-ish purple color and appear to look like cellulitis. At this point, I decided to go to a walk-in clinic and the Dr. was very surprised, very concerned, and beside himself because he had never seen anything like this. (his reaction concerned me) He decided to treat it like Cellulitis and gave me pills that I had to take every four hours for 10 days. It appeared that the medication did nothing they still looked horrible 2 weeks later. I decided to grab some anti-itch vitamin E Neosporin, and self-latch bandage wrap I wrapped them uptight and kept them on for 2 days I did this twice and each time I unwrapped them they looked better and better. Now it's February, 12th and they look and feel better but they are very scared, discolored, and there are dead skin and scabs, my skin feels dried out and wrinkly.

I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I'm a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

I discussed the above findings with patient and her husband.  I reviewed her MRI scan with the help of a spine model.  I outlined both conservative and surgical approaches.  However, given her findings and the severity of her pain currently, I think one could argue that a left L4-L5 microlumbar diskectomy via far lateral approach would be her most definitive option.  I did outline this procedure in detail with the help of a spine model.  I outlined the risks which include but are not limited to infection, bleeding complications, nerve root and/or cauda equina injury, cerebrospinal fluid leak, recurrent disk herniation, spinal instability, the possibility that she could require additional spine surgery in the future, and the possibility that her would not be relieved to her satisfaction.  We also discussed trying a left L4-L5 foraminal steroid injection but she has had injections in the past and she actually felt like it gave her more pain.  At this point she would like to go ahead and schedule the left L4-L5 microlumbar diskectomy via far lateral approach with METRx.

She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient's thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.

I woke up this morning (the 12th) with a swollen underarm but no chills or fever.   The swolling in my underarm as gotten larger and is getting ?more? tender.

I was advised that I would be required to wait on site for 30 minutes after my Pfizer vaccination so that I could be monitored for any adverse reaction from it.  After waiting 30 minutes, my husband and I were cleared to go home.    At 2:30 PM, I started to experience a swelling of my tongue and throat.  I immediately took three 25 mg Benadryl tablets as I have done when I experienced past allergic reactions.  I also began to consume significant amounts of water to help with swallowing.  I then called my husband and asked him to come home.    At about 3:30 PM, the swelling of my tongue began to diminish and by 4:30 PM I began to swallow more easily and was able to reduce consumption of water.     I had a very light dinner at 5:30 PM, and went to bed at 8:30 PM.  At 10:00 PM I went to sleep.  I slept somewhat restlessly and woke at 5:00 AM as I usually do.

Along with the right armpit soreness, I noticed I had some numbness and tingling of my left arm and hands. It was intermittently to my left leg and foot. Felt like pins and needles.   Yesterday, I notices it also intermittently to my right leg and foot. I have never had  this prior to the vaccine. It still remains, but  feels like it may be more dull feeling today than yesterday.   I took Extra Strength Tylenol and Extra strength Excedrin headache for most of the pain.

Within a few minutes of walking around, the numbness subsided and became very strong pins and needles in my hands.  Around 3 am, the pins and needles intensity had decreased but tingling had come up from fingertips to armpits and from toes to mid thigh but the intensity of the paresthesia was decreasing.  Around 8 am, I noticed that my coordination (could be weakness, I couldn't determine what it was) in my upper extremities was off when I was unloading the dishwasher.  I was able to unload without dropping anything but I was definitely off.  I called employee health when they opened (I was given the shot at the hospital where I work) and they said to call PCP immediately.  I called an MD office who said I needed to go to the ER but I could feel it improving so I didn't want to go to the ER.  Around 10am on 2/11/2021, the temperature sensation in my arms was off.  One felt very hot and the other was cold sensation and freezing to the touch and the bottom of my feet felt like I was standing on ice.  I ended up calling MDlive because I did feel like it was getting better and didn't want to go to the ER.  Telehealth MD said to go to the ER to rule out Guillian Barre.  I called another doc who said they would see me.  I went to new PCP at 1330.  At this time, I tingling was in the bottom of my feet and some in the hands and sporadically throughout the arms and legs but again with less intensity.  MD ran bloodwork to rule out another cause.  Bloodwork came back normal so they said that they after talking with MD, NP and MD thought the that this is a reaction to vaccine and I had no progressing weakness so they ruled out Gullian Barre but instructed me to go to ER if worsened.

1031371,02/13/2021,,72.0,71,,M,,"Guillain-Barre Syndrome Narrative:  71 year old male with PMH diabetes mellitus type 2 complicated by peripheral neuropathy and cervical and lumbar stenosis, who presented for AIDP/Guillain barre. Patient was in his usual state of health prior to admission. He had an influenza vaccination late October 2020. About three days later he developed numbness and weakness of the bilateral feet and legs. November 3rd he noticed that this began worsening and raising up more proximally up his legs. he also had bilateral hand weakness and numbness which was worsening as well. He presented to a community hospital 11/5 2020 when he also developed bilateral hand numbness and weakness that has been worsening. He was admitted for AIDP . On 11/8/2020 patient required intubation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration and inability to protect airway. He had piperacillin/tazobactam for aspiration pneumonia completed on 11/25/2020, and then was transitioned to amoxicillin/clav. Hospital course was complicated by AKI secondary to contrast induced nephropathy, which peaked to 4.1 before decreasing back to baseline. He received a total of 5 days of IVIG and also suffered from critical illness myopathy. Also has been treated for dysphagia and was on a honey thick liquids and pureed diet. T2DM managed with Detemir 15 units SC BID. Seen by psychiatry on 11/19/2020 for suicidal ideation and cleared at that time (he was started on sertraline 50 mg PO daily). During his acute inpatient rehabilitation stay he initially suffered from delirium with 1 fall while on the unit. He improved drastically after adjustments to his gabapentin. There was suspicion that withdrawal was contributing to his delirium. QTC noted to be prolonged therefore his quetiapine was stopped. Transitioned back to oral antihyperglycemics early in his stay. Initially he was unable to stand secondary to his AIDP and critical illness myopathy. This has improved with therapy. Patient was also initially constipated, but then began having multiple loose stools after being started on an aggressive bowel regimen. He was tested for C diff, which returned negative. Bowel regimen has been titrated down to senna PO QHS. He initially suffered from areflexic bladder with elevated PVRS and no sensation to void. He was trained on intermittent catheterization and sterile cath technique. He eventually developed sensation of needing to void and began having continent voids. Patient had complaints of frequent urination from 4-8 pm. PVR bladder scan followed by a straight cath PVR were obtained, and returned low. It was hypothesized that due to fluid mobilization at the end of the day when patient elevates his BLE triggered his need for frequent urination. He was supplied with a urinal to use in the evenings to minimize the risk of falling. It was discussed that patient may benefit from a urodynamic study in 6 months from discharge. On 12/17/2020 he had acute onset of chills, feeling of recurrent weakness, and malaise. URine found to have bacteria. This was the second UTI he has had since onset of AIDP. CT ordered for R/O Bladder stone, which returned without kidney stones nor bladder stones. However an incidental hyperechoic mass on the kidney was seen bilaterally, with recommendations for MRI renal protocol. Initially patient was placed on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but due to urine culture resulting with E. coli, he was transitioned to cephalexin (finished a 14 day course) and started on methanamine for prophylaxis. Patient was interested in work up of his BUE tremors while he continued to progress in therapy. He was evaluated by neurologist. Labwork work up was unremarkable and symptoms deemed likely secondary to benign familial tremors. Since patient's quality of life was unaffected and he did not have social embarrassment from his tremors, he declined pursuing medication treatment. Plans are for him to follow up with provider in 6 months from discharge. Patient continued to do well throughout his stay. After being seen and examined by attending physician on 1/22/2021, he was deemed stable for discharge home.",,,,,Y,,,Y,N,10/26/2020,10/26/2020,0,,OTH,,,,,,,2,02/13/2021,,Y,Y,

I took a 7 day course of celebrex (200mg orally once daily) on 1/25/21, prescribed by my primary physician for a flare up of low back pain.  A 14 day course was prescribed; I stopped taking it after 7 days because my stomach was getting upset and I didn't want to take it close to my 2nd covid moderna booster. I got my 2nd moderna covid vaccine booster on 2/8/21.  For 1-2 days, my left arm (injection site) was sore and I was mildly fatigued.   I took over the counter advil  (200mg twice daily) and tylenol (500mg twice daily); the day I took advil, I was sneezing and developed signs of allergic rhinitis (congestion/runny eyes and nose). I did not have any other immediate adverse reaction and by Thursday, 2/11, the arm soreness and fatigue resolved.   My low back pain began to bother me again, so I took a 200mg oral dose of celebrex at 7:30a on 2/12/21. I went to work (I am a veterinary neurologist. While at work, at 9:30a on 2/12/21, I had a severe anaphylactic reaction and had to be taken via ambulance to Medical Center.  I developed hives/welts/burning/itching all over my body,  within 5 minutes my throat closed up, I couldn't breathe, I became hypotensive/collapsed; in the ambulance, I was given IM epinephrine; then at the ER, I was given IV steroids (solumedrol), benedryl, famotidine, zofran (due to abdominal pain/nausea) and IV fluids. This stabilized my signs within 1 hour and I improved and was going to be discharged at 2pm. However,  the hives returned at that time, so I was given additional IV benedryl, famotidine, fluids and oral prednisone and kept in the hospital overnight for monitoring; I was discharged to go home on 2/13/21 on a 4 day course of oral famotidine, benedryl and prednisone; I remained itchy and continued sneezing at home on 2/13/21. Today, 2/14/21, all signs of this reaction have resolved.    The ER doctors and myself believe the 2nd moderna covid booster on 2/8/21 stimulated my innate immune system, leading to this anaphylactic reaction to celebrex (a medication I had taken 2 weeks prior with no problem).   The doctors feel the celebrex is what set off the anaphylactic shock, but that my immune system was primed to do so after the vaccine.  In hindsight, I realized that I was having allergic rhinitis symptoms after taking oral advil on 2/9 the day after my booster (which has never happened to me before either). I am a person with no pre-existing allergies of any kind. There was nothing different at all in my routine including food or potential environmental exposures) on 2/12, the day of my anaphylactic reaction, other than my taking a 200mg dose of oral celebrex.  I am not allowed to take NSAIDs until I see an allergist for testing now.

It is a cluster of several discrete blisters at the corner of my mouth.  I am assuming since I have HSV 2 that that is what these blisters are and for some reason the vaccine triggered this response.  I wanted to report  it because a) it is in a place where I have never had an outbreak and b) I thought there might be a chance that it's not HSV 2 and that the vaccine may cause this reaction in some people.
