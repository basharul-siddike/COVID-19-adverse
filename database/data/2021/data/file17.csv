I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids.

Her disorientation went away by 10AM on 19Jan2021- she did not see anyone or go to a provider. Her body started not responding around 7:30 when she got up, and by 9 or 10AM, she was functioning again. The patient didn't think this was from vaccine, she had seen enough vaccine reactions to various vaccines, and this was not a vaccine reaction, she thought what is happening? Is this a stroke, or a vascular event, she has since recovered but was still very shook, anxious about what it was, what happened until an hour or so after, it was still under her. Causality: Unknown, she didn't think of the connection until someone else did, she was describing it and the other person said it was because of the vaccine, as this person was a skeptic and doesn't want the vaccine herself, and this was not a typical response, but then she got to thinking. The outcome of disoriented/disorientation and body not responding/she couldn't function was recovered on 19Jan2021, the other event was unknown.

About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two ""attacks"".  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of ""foggy"" 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these ""attacks"", not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours.

A contactable other healthcare professional reported that an approximately 7-year-old boy developed an episode of hyperinflammatory flare following vaccination with pneumococcal-13-valent-CRM197-vaccine-conjugate. Additionally, he exhibited lack of efficacy during treatment with azathioprine and methotrexate for chronic pulmonary disease and hyperinflammatory flares [dosages and routes not stated]. The boy was admitted at the age of 10 years for diagnostic lung biopsy in the setting of progressive chronic hypoxic respiratory failure and recurrent hyperinflammatory episodes. He had history of multiple hospital admissions due to infection-triggered recurrent hyperinflammatory flares. At the age of 4 months, he was admitted, for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. He was again admitted at the age of 1 year for hypospadias repair, and at the age of 3 years and 4 months he was hospitalised for another RSV infection. At the age of 3 years and 8 months he was admitted for what was thought to be mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus positive IgM. Mild gross motor developmental delay was also noted. Till the age of 3 years he received regular vaccination. Subsequently, he stopped receiving vaccine. Approximately, at the age of 4 years, he was admitted with viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory symptoms slowly resolved and haematologic findings improved, thus representing a hyperinflammatory flare that recurred regularly over the following 6 years ranging from 4 to 17 weeks duration mainly treated with unspecified steroids. During the next flare he exhibited with anaemia, leucocytosis and thrombocytosis along with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and fevers. Infarcted spleen was also noted. This flare was associated with human herpes virus 7 viraemia. He was readmitted to hospital multiple times for such episodes. During two separate hospitalisations for flares, the diagnosis of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) were both considered based upon his laboratory features. Overall, two bone marrow biopsies were performed approximately 1 year apart, and both demonstrated normal cellularity and markedly increased hemophagocytosis. Subsequently, he received pneumococcal-13-valent-CRM197- vaccine-conjugate [prevnar-13] vaccine, and developed an episode of hyperinflammatory flare [duration of treatment to reaction onset not stated] which lasted for 4 months. It was complicated by prednisone responsive pericardial effusion and presumed inflammatory pneumonitis. He became corticosteroid dependent weaning of which resulted into haemolysis and dark urine. By the age of 8 years, his episodes were characterized less by persistent febrile episodes but more by shortness of breath, chest discomfort and intermittent desaturations. His condition was steroid responsive and therefore he was treated with prednisone. Subsequently, he started receiving steroid sparing therapy with methotrexate and azathioprine for hyperinflammatory flares and chronic pulmonary disease (later diagnosed as interstitial lung disease). The boy stopped receiving methotrexate and azathioprine. Later, due to his progressive respiratory symptoms, he was admitted to the hospital at the age of 10 years for lung biopsy. After lung biopsy, his condition worsened with right haemothorax and pneumothorax along with respiratory distress. For treatment of his inflammatory state corticosteroid dose was increased and gradually weaned, while anakinra and ciclosporin [cyclosporine] were trialed followed by tocilizumab, with minimal benefit. He died prior to his 11th birthday due to respiratory failure. Whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous paternal frame shift a HMOX1 c.264_269delCTGG (p.L89Sfs*24) and maternal splice donor HMOX1 (c.636 + 2 T > A) consistent with HMOX1 deficiency. Finally he was diagnosed with HMOX1 deficiency that had recurrent autoinflammatory episodes marked by fever, hemolysis and hyperferritinaemia with pathologic features similar to MAS and HLH. Author Comment ""He received the Prevnar 13 vaccination and developed another hyperinflammatory episode lasting 4 months complicated by steroid responsive pericardial effusion and presumed inflammatory pneumonitis.""

Immediately after that I started getting tingling and numbness bilaterally in my hands and fingers with a heavy sensation.  My heart also started racing.  The nurses put me in a wheelchair and escorted me upstairs to the ER.  In transit my face and throat/neck started getting tingling as well.  By the time we reached the ER waiting room (9:42 am) I got the shakes/chills and was very cold.  I continued having the shakes for several minutes.  By the time I was brought back into the triage area (9:50 am) my legs from the shin to feet bilaterally started going numb/tingly as well.  I started having a cyclical reaction.  I would shake/have the chills for about 5 minutes (without any tingling/numbness in extremities), after that I would get a full body flushing sensation with feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, followed by numbness/tingling in both hands and feet. Then the cycle would repeat itself for several hours.  I continued to have a heavy sensation of my hands and feet until about 10:15 am.  After that the heaviness sensation did not accompany the tingling/numbness that persisted.  I was hooked up to IV fluids and IV benadryl at 10:45 am.  By 12:30 I finally stopped getting the chills/shaking sensation but I had a consistent body flushing followed by tingling/numbness in my hands and feet (mostly hands/arms) about every 5 minutes.  Around 1 pm I all symptoms had stopped.  The doctor said all my tests and blood work looked good.   I was discharged from the hospital around 2:45 pm with instrustions to followup with primary doc or return to the ER if symptoms got worse.   At 5:30 pm that evening all my symptoms came back, started with chills and then full body flushing sensation followed by tingling/numbness in both arms/hands bilaterally. I also had a hot sensation up the entire side of my left arm (injection site arm) up to my ear.     I took 2 500 mg tablets of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl at 6:20.  By 6:40 I was starting to feel a little better with less shaking and less body flushing/tingling.  Symptoms seemed gone by 7 pm.  I went to bed at 9 pm and woke up around 10:30 pm to my body flushing and my hands going tingling/numb.  I tried to sleep, but could not.  Around 11:30 pm I took 1 500 mg tablet of Tylenol and 2 25 mg tablets of benadryl.  I woke up the next morning (2/6/2021) with no numbness/tingling shaking or body flushing.  I felt extremely exhausted and sore.  That day my symptoms did not return.   I woke up on Sunday 2/7/2021 with no symptoms, but around 8:30 am I had a lightheaded episode and hot sensation with a feeling of nausea.  I then started to get tingling in my face, mouth and lips.

1015629,02/09/2021,FL,,,,M,,"TRIGGERING HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO PRESSURE PALSIES; A report has been received from a literature article concerning a 19 years old male patient.    The authors reported the case of a 19-year-old previously healthy man, who presented with 2 weeks of numbness, tingling and weakness in both upper and lower extremities. He had received influenza vaccine ((influenza virus vaccine live) (unknown manufacturer, route and formulation) 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms and did 20 push-ups (part of his physical fitness exam) the night before his symptoms started.     On physical examination, he had high feet arches and bilateral scapular winging. Medical history was not significant. He denied previous episodes of wrist drop, foot drop or numbness, and tingling. His father had arterial hypertension and high feet arches but no weakness. He did not take any prescription medicines and denied tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. He had been in the job for 9 months and exercised regularly, as part of his training.    Neurological examination showed Agency strength of 3/5 in intrinsic hand muscles and finger extensors (other muscles including lower extremities were 5/5); decreased vibration and pinprick at toes and hands, absent deep tendon reflexes and a negative Babinski sign.  Nerve conduction study (NCS) showed absent median sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), small ulnar and radial SNAPs with prolonged peak latencies, and sural SNAP amplitudes of 7 mV. Bilateral median and ulnar motor NCS showed prolonged onset latencies, small compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, slow conduction velocities, and prolonged F-waves. Peroneal and tibial motor NCS showed normal onset latencies, CMAP amplitudes, and slightly slow conduction velocities (39 m/s). Electromyography showed active denervation in abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous.  Cerebrospinal fluid showed slightly elevated protein (48 mg/dL) and 3 white blood cells.    Diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome was made based on acute onset, sural sparing on NCS and prolonged latencies and F-waves. Intravenous immunoglobulin 2 g/kg divided into 4 doses was administered with minimal clinical improvement. Although he had no neurological history, the symptom onset after vigorous exercise, the presence of high foot arches and scapular winging led us to suspect HNPP, and genetic testing was ordered. He was found to have PMP22 gene deletion, consistent with diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) (preferred term: hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies).    At 2 months follow-up, scapular winging had resolved, and median and ulnar CMAP amplitudes have returned to normal, but there was electrophysiological evidence of median neuropathy at the wrist and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Sural SNAP amplitude was 6 mV.    The event was considered serious (important medical event).    Laboratory values and diagnostic test details are available.    The authors highlighted: ""The possible role of the influenza vaccine in triggering HNPP symptoms, in our case, deserves to be mentioned. Although HNPP patients can develop symptoms with only exercise as a trigger even after being enrolled in the program, we postulate that, in our previously asymptomatic patient, the influenza immunization triggered a mild transient autoimmune reaction that coupled with excessive exercise led to his acute neuropathy.""

The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn't happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started.

I went bed about 10pm, and woke up to my right arm having a series of tiny shooting pain tingling (at specific spots, as if it were a pin prick traveling up and down my arm; pinging randomly across the arm). This  was accompanied by an extreme desire to scratch/itch my arm where the pin pricks were being felt. I found myself scratching my arm in my sleep. There didn't seem to be a discernable rash of any color, but by the next day, i was seeing slight welts at various points along my upper and lower outer arm. I would feel a sharp pin-prick/tingle and instantly would feel the urge to scratch it. The scratching continued -- but not consistently. Sometimes for an hour or two at a time, seemingly coming out of no where. The arm was fine and then I'd wake up or be jolted by the sharp pin prick accompanied by the insane desire to scratch my arm.   These 'spells' of tingling and itching have continued until today (one week and one day after getting the #2 Moderna shot.  I have managed this with Benedryl (it worked by addressing the itching somewhat and provided relief from the tingling - it made me sleepy); anti-itch creams (soothed the skin topically), ice (to take the sting/itch sensation away) and calamine lotion (didn't really work). Tonight (1/8/2021 I cannot sleep. Although the itching and sensations seem to be intermittent, I have woken up the last couple of nights with intense itching and tingling to the point I couldn't sleep  Usually Benedryl calms everything down, but tonight it isn't helping at all and I am crawling out of my skin.

Less than 36 hours later I experience a rapid heart rate (110 - 128) and shortness of breath not related to activity.   I had anticipated body aches, chills etc and did have those as well.  Over the course of 4 - 5 days those resolved but my tachycardia and shortness of breath have not.  I waited another week to see if it would improve and when that did not occur I made an appointment to see Cardiologist because quite frankly, I was fearful of my symptoms.  My lungs remain clear, I have no difficulty taking a deep breath and my SAO2 is high 90's.  I had my annual physical 1/18/2021 and my lab work was normal as was my EKG.  I have never had shortness of breath and my heart rate was normally in the 70 - 80's range at rest.  Doctor ordered testing and the results are in My Chart.  I had a Echo/Stress/Echo which was normal.  My EF was 60% and in spite of my extreme shortness of breath on the treadmill, there was no ischemia induced.  Bp was elevated initially and during the test but returned to 130's/70's in recovery phase.  SAO2 was 97% to 100%.  I did a home sleep study on 1/31/2021 with results pending.  Doctor stated there was nothing on my testing that would account for my symptoms.  At my initial visit (1/26/2021)he started me on low dose Cardezem 120mg to address my heart rate.  My heart rate has improved with Cardezem (increased to 240 mg 2/2/2021) but my shortness of breath with minimal exertion has not.  I believe Doctor plans to order a PFT next.

Then after about a week it had not gone away and even started to hurt worse.  I have gotten to the point that when I have any type of physical activity my shoulder starts killing me.  It's real sharp pains that cause me to stop what I'm doing and sit down and hold still until the pain fades.  So after about 11 days from the day of the vaccine my wife walked into the kitchen where I was trying to make dinner and had stopped and closed my eyes standing there in pain.  She said, if it hurts that bad you need to see a doctor.  So the next day I visited my doctor and he didn't really know what was causing it .  It had been 12 days since the injection and you can still slightly feel the  place in my arm.  He gave me a medium dose of  steroids and a antibiotic to see if something like that will help.  Early on I was putting ice packs on it and taking hot showers with the  hot water stream directly on my shoulder.  One strange thing about it is  it only hurts after/during activity and the pain is at other locations like running up my neck  and around the back of my shoulder.  I feel like it's something  with the joint or nerves because of that.  The only thing that seems to help is my not moving it.",,,,,,,,,N,01/27/2021,01/27/2021,0,"No real tests, just saw my regular doctor and he speculated on a few things and gave me a steroid shot and antibiotics.",WRK,,"Omega-3 1000MG , One A Day Men's multi vitamin, Aspirin EC 81 MG Lisinopril 40MG Ibuprofen 800MG Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets 40MG Metoprolol Succ ER 25 MG",None,High Blood Pressure,,,2,02/09/2021,,Y,,None

At NP appt, angioedema on left arm measured 5x7, on right arm 1x3 and on chest from armpit to armpit with hives on top. Face had started stinging and itching. Started Pepcid, Claritin, and Prednisone 40mg. 10/23/2020 Facial stinging itch intensified. Went to  Urgent Care there and saw NP. She felt the reaction was due to latex somehow injected during the vaccinations and not a reaction to the vaccines themselves. When she suggested latex as a reason for my severe facial itching, it made since. I have had two episodes in the past twenty years with the facial itching, both due to latex. She increased the Prednisone to 60mg x 3 days and taper, gave a shot of Benadryl, and ordered Benadryl 50mg every 4 hours. 10/25/2020 Facial itching 75% better by my second dose of Benadryl. 10/28/2020 Saw primary, she ordered DepoMedrol 80mg and Decadron 8mg, stop prednisone. 01/18/2021 Saw Dr, dermatologist for repeat patch test to determine what exactly I was allergic to since my patch test and latex allergy diagnosis was from the late 90?s.

Both manufacturers, Sanofi and Pfizer, state no natural rubber latex in their products, however, they don?t say what the syringe plunger?s stopper, or the tip of the prefilled syringe is made from. Mercaptobenzothiazole is not only in natural rubber, but also butyl rubber, nitrile and neoprene.

A severe headache resulted with a painful, stiff neck, occasional fever, occasional diarrhea, confusion, vision changes, and increased imbalance. These symptoms lasted for about 1 week before I sought medical treatment at a virtual urgent care appointment on 1/5/21. They referred me to an in-person urgent care facility that day. At that facility, they said my symptoms were very concerning and said I needed to seek immediate medical assistance at the ED and offered to call me an ambulance. My husband drove me to the ED from the urgent care facility. At the ED, they treated me with a migraine work-up but eventually discharged me with instructions to follow-up as I was ""diagnostically unclear"" at discharge. After a week, my symptoms had not improved at all and so my previous ED physician suggested that I return to the ED (after being unable to get care in a timely manner in an outpatient setting). At the ED on 1/12/21, they again treated me with a migraine workup but also conducted a CT scan and a COVID test. When both tests came back negative, they conducted a lumbar puncture procedure. Those results came back positive for viral meningitis. As I had no other illness or known exposure to any other virus at that time - and given the timeframe of the vaccine administration - my care team concluded that this was a rare reaction to the COVID vaccine.
