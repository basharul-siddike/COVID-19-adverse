She was just in the hospital for myocarditis and they did a heart cath and she has no plugged arteries, nothing. They couldn't find anything other than she had another virus that went to her heart. She had another virus a year ago January. She wonders if COVID was out there then, because she had never been so sick with the flu. She kind of diagnosed her problem and it was like a wave over her body. She also had a terrible irregular pulse. When she went to the hospital the next morning, her cardiac enzymes were 4.5 times more than normal, her troponin was out of sight. She doesn't think that would have a bearing because she should be coming out of that myocarditis because of the medication the doctor put her on. She doesn't know if that would complicate it, too. Her heart doctor said a lot of people have myocarditis, especially athletes, but they are young and fall over dead. 90% of the time, its myocarditis because you don't know you have it.  She reports she's getting a foggy brain. Her son asked her who her dentist was because she had a root canal and she couldn't think of the dentist's name. She thinks her son threw that in because her son knew that she wouldn't be able to remember. She's not confused. It's just difficult to get the word out, but if she waits a couple minutes, she has the answer. She is also getting old, too. She lives by herself; she has no stimulation and she thinks that is significant to her circumstances. She thinks it's a problem with the COVID-19 injection. Caller explains she had blood work very recently about 2 weeks ago. She just looked at lab reports and everything was okay except one of the vitamins was a tiny bit high (she can't remember what the vitamin was), but nothing she was worried about. It could have been a Potassium was a little high, but she is not worried about that. Her main question is how long the fatigue last, she thought for only 1-2 days. She mentions she took her temperature every morning and its always like 97 something and it's never wavered. The outcome of the events brain fog, incredible fatigue, and could sleep around the clock was not recovered and the outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information provided, viral myocarditis is most likely due to a viral infection in this patient with cardiovascular co-morbidities and is not related to suspect product.

The consumer reported two reports for two separate vaccine doses for the same patient. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot/batch number and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included advanced stages of Multiple Sclerosis, Diabetes, depressant, covid prior vaccination. The patient's concomitant medications included diabetic meds (pills), anti-depressants, etc. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Dec2020 at age of 74 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced neurological setback and it wasn't terribly obvious at that time. Facility type vaccine was Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient (mother of the reporter) suffered a neurological setback following the first injection, although it wasn't terribly obvious at that time, in comparison to what occurred after she received the second vaccine. The patient suffered major neurological damage after the second vaccine; unable to speak, followed by an inability to move, chew, eat, etc. The reporter also noticed optical neuritis or changes in her eyes. Her right eye was bulging. Neither eye looked in the same direction, or able to track objects. The patient was currently in a long term acute hospital (pending clarification) with a tracheostomy and a food peg. She had advanced stages of Multiple Sclerosis. Reporter had since learned she had been advised by her MS doctors NOT to receive flu shots. The reporter had known this and would not have listened to the doctors at the nursing home, who recommended she receive the Covid Vaccine. This was serious. The reporter was awaiting medical records, which would provide exact dates, times, etc of the administration of the vaccines. Adverse events resulted in Disability or permanent damage. Known allergies: Apparently the Covid Vaccine by Pfizer. If treatment adverse events: unknown. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

INDICATION: Left sided facial abscess COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: There is cellulitis and below the lower left malar region in the left lower with heterogeneously enhancing mass with slightly indistinct margins in the expected region of the left masseter muscle, measuring approximately 4.8 x 5.1 x 3.2 cm abutting the ramus of left hemimandible and the posterior angle of the left hemimandible and anterior to the left parotid gland with slight extension to the superior portion of the superficial lobe of left parotid gland. The lesion appears more solid than cystic, with a complicated abscess not excluded. There are adjacent dental caries in the left lower jaw, which may be source of infection left facial cellulitis and a mass lesion noted lateral to the left mandible. Inflammatory changes extend deep to the inferior left hemimandible and anterior to the upper left submandibular gland. There is asymmetric thickening of the left platysma with no significant abnormality of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Extension of the lesion into the left parotid gland is less likely but not excluded, with the inferior left parotid gland not well-seen. The right parotid gland and bilateral submandibular glands are normal. Mild adenopathy is seen in the left submental chain and in the left submandibular chain extending into left level three lymph nodes lateral to the left jugular vein at C5-6 level. The largest node is located anterolateral  to the left submandibular gland measuring 1.5 x 0.9 cm on axial image 36. Lymph node lateral to the left jugular vein at C5-6 level measures approximately 1.3 x 1.1 cm. No right-sided adenopathy and no right-sided facial cellulitis or inflammatory process. The thyroid gland is normal. Partial opacification of the left maxillary sinus and mild chronic mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells. Frontal sinuses are not included on the exam and not evaluated. There is an old depressed fracture deformity in the floor of the right orbit/roof of right maxillary sinus. Remaining partially included paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Fixation plates and screws posteriorly in the region of angle of bilateral hemimandible.  Periapical lucency related to the left mandibular molar tooth. Dystrophic calcifications in the palatine tonsils with no enlargement of the palatine tonsils. Effacement of the left vallecula and left piriform sinus may be related to mucus or saliva or developmental asymmetry, but suggest correlation with direct visualization for further assessment. Remaining soft tissues of the pharynx and larynx are symmetric and within normal limits. Chronic spondylosis in the cervical spine, greatest at C5/6 level with loss of disc height and endplate sclerosis and spondylosis with a disc osteophyte complex posteriorly to the  right of midline. Bilateral foraminal narrowing at C5-6. Included upper lungs are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Cellulitis in the left lower anterolateral face with heterogeneous mass in the region of the  left masseter muscle is indeterminate for phlegmonous reaction, myositis of the left masseter muscle or complex abscess but no drainable fluid collection is seen. Neoplasm in the region of the left masseter muscle is less likely. Please correlate clinically. 2. Mild reactive adenopathy in the left submandibular chain, left submental chain and left level three lymph nodes. 3. There may be mild sialadenitis involving the left parotid gland with extension of the above mass lesion into the left parotid gland less likely. Remaining salivary glands and the thyroid gland are unremarkable. 4. Dental caries, which may be a source of patient's left facial cellulitis the lesion in the left masseter region. Left maxillary and mild bilateral ethmoid sinusitis. Nonspecific periapical lucency related to left mandibular molar tooth. 5. Old depressed fracture of the floor of the right orbit. Postsurgical densities bilaterally in the posterior mandible. 6. Asymmetric effacement of the left vallecula and piriform sinuses. May consider correlation with direct visualization if clinically indicated. 7. Chronic spondylosis in the cervical spine, greatest at C5-6 with and eccentric disc osteophyte complex posteriorly to the right of midline. Please see above report for the other findings This CT exam was performed using one or more of the following dose reduction techniques:  automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size, and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique.

At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.",,,,,,,,,N,12/29/2020,02/01/2021,34,"CBC, CMP and MRI or brain completed on 3/9/2021 Follow up CMP, CBC, ESR and CRP are currently pending on 3/11.",PUB,,none,none,none,,,2,03/11/2021,,Y,,No known allergies

Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient's legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling ""a star"" on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%.

Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.",,,,,,,,,,03/11/2021,03/11/2021,0,,PVT,,Insulin Glargine; Metformin,,Diabetes Mellitus,,,2,03/11/2021,,,Y,Penicillin; Aspirin;Exeanatide;Iodinated Contrast Media;Others

As a result, at the direction of her psychiatrist, we began to taper off the Venlaxafine beginning on March 1.  Over time, the jaw tremor was less noticeable.  However, on March 10, 2021, patient received the 2nd does of the Pfizer vaccine.  The next day, March 11, 2021, the jaw tremor was worse than ever.  I can see the tremor - basically, her lower (?) jaw trembles and you can see the trembling in her mouth and chin.  It does not cause pain, and she does not have any other symptoms (no chills, fever, body aches, rashes, difficult breathing, etc.).  We talked to her pediatrician and to her psychiatrist.  Neither one could say what is causing the tremor; perhaps it is the COVID vaccine; perhaps it is the Venlaxafine (she's not all the way off of it yet); perhaps something else.

Finally, an MRI has confirmed physician's recent suspicion that my  second Moderna vaccination was improperly administered. In fact, it tore a  tendon in my right shoulder. I knew something was wrong when I saw how high  the needle was injected into my arm/shoulder. I just didn't know what the  ramifications would be.  I have been referred to a surgeon, and my appt. is 3/16).  Summary of Events:  On 2/1/21, I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine and had 2 days  of moderate pain and soreness.  But about 3 days later, 2/4, I awoke to excruciating shoulder/arm pain that had  me sobbing out loud. I took Tylenol and waited. Nothing. I took more Tylenol and  slowly the pain diminished. For an hour or so.  All I could do was lie on the couch, literally, groaning and unable to lift my arm  By evening, the only relief I could get was from an old (hip surgery) Oxycodone pill. I took 1/4 piece and slept the night.  Friday and Saturday I was totally debilitated. I couldn't lift my arm, care for my  dog or do anything but lie on the couch, still sobbing, until small pieces of the  Oxy set in again.  It was the weekend, and I didn't want to bother anyone but I never felt such pain  for such an extended time or survived so long on meds.  Monday morning, 2/8/21, I called my Doctor. I was very  concerned and really wanted to make sure this pain was still from the vaccine  and not some ""weird"" condition that might have hit me. The office told me the  pain was probably from the vaccine and advised me to keep taking Tylenol. So it  continued, on and off, relief and agony. I was sure it would stop. It didn't.  Thursday, 2/11, I saw the Doctor, in person.  Physician did not have an answer for the pain but gave me a prescription for  Celebrex and did a blood test to see if there was a bacteria infection that might  have invaded the area. We would wait for results. Another weekend of pain but  lessened a bit.  Around 2/13, a neighbor called me with an article he found about the SAME  situation MANY people were suffering (thousands) and LAWSUITS pending!! I  didn't know what was happening to me but the Gov't did. The article was found  on internet, 2/12, and printed an article from news paper, 2/12  No  other reports appeared anywhere. The pertinent findings of the article: thousands of vaccinated people (Covid and  flu) have reported similar pain and debilitation. The previous gov't has  introduced a law prohibiting lawsuits (l think against the pharmas but not the  administering agencies. Not sure.) that was to go into effect, 2/23. Again, not sure  of details.  But no one knows about this - people NEED to know. I immediately notified my  family and close friend about my situation. While the cause is not certain, it is  suspected that improper injection technique/training/experience is to blame.  To get the word out, I posted on social media, wrote representatives, etc.   And now I found you.

PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife.

I took another 25mg of hydroxyzine but the itching wasn't subsiding and at that point, it was so bad that I couldn't focus on anything else.

Exactly 8 days later, my left arm (same injection arm but NOT at the injection site) felt itchy.  When I looked at my arm, there was a huge, oval shaped, red, swollen, hard bump on the front of my shoulder.  The skin also felt very leathery.  I wasn't sure what was going on and it was Friday and my doctor's office had already closed.  I spoke with a pharmacist where our family gets prescriptions and he asked if I had any other types of symptoms.  I did not.  He said had not heard of this type of reaction from the vaccine this many days later and directed me to call my primary care if it didn't clear up in a couple of days.  It did clear up.  First the leathery skin went away the next day, followed by the redness and swelling and then after a couple of days it still felt slightly itchy but visually, the location looked like my normal skin.

1094513,03/12/2021,KY,28.0,28,,F,,"I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.",,,,,,,,,N,02/12/2021,02/20/2021,8,02/22/2021 - Topirmaite Level CK T4 Free TSH Pregnancy Venous Blood Gas Line Phosphorus  Magnesium Lactic Acid Heptic Function Panel Differential CDC Basic Metabolic Function Urinalysis EMG,PUB,,Topamax 100mg 2x daily (total 200mg daily) Yasmin Generic Zofran as needed,,Mild Lupus (remission),FLU Vaccine,,2,03/12/2021,,Y,Y,None

Within a couple of hours, it had settled in the back and inside of my arm, just above my elbow.  The area was about 5 inches long and about 3 inches wide.  About 7:00 that night, I was getting chills, then a fever and a severe, piercing headache along with body aches.  My temp is normally about 97.3 degrees, but for the next 36 hours or so, it ran between 97.6 and 100.4  degrees.  I began taking Tylenol when it reached 100 degrees.   On 03-01-2021, I ran chills again, with my temp getting up to 99 degrees.  I also got that severe, piercing headache again. It lasted nearly 24 hours.   Since that day, I have had that piercing headache a few times, but it hasn't lasted long.   (NOTE:   I have had very few headaches in my lifetime.  The last one was probably about 15 years ago, when I had the flu.)  Also, about 3 or 4 days after receiving that 2nd shot,  I opened a drawer in my dresser and the pain shot down from the tips of my fingers to my wrist.  By that evening, the pain had  continued down to that spot just above my elbow, where the shot had settled.  My fingers,  hand, wrist and arm hurt very badly for the next 3 days.  The pain did not go past that spot on my arm where the shot had settled.  The next day it didn't hurt as badly and the next day, the pain was gone.    Also, my 89 year old mother had her 2nd shot the same day as I did and had no affects at all, not even a sore arm.

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of influenza-associated encephalopathy/encephalitis (IAE) in a 4-years old female patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was girl. The patient's parents denied vomiting, diarrhoea, dysuria, rash or breathing difficulty. Three household contacts had similar complaints. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided.  On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided) in the prior season. However, the patient had not received a vaccine for the current season [History revealed that she had an influenza vaccine in the prior season, but she had not received a vaccine for the current season].  On an unspecified date, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient was transferred to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) intubated due to status epilepticus and acute respiratory failure. Her symptoms started with fever, runny nose and generalised fatigue 6 days prior to admission. The patient was treated supportively at home with appropriate doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. The patient's parents put her to bed on the night before admission. Six hours later, the patient was rushed to the local emergency room (ER) after being found unresponsive with tactile fever, bowel and bladder incontinence. At the ER, the child was afebrile, with heart rate 136 beats per minute, blood pressure 95/57 mm Hg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 88% on ambient air. The patient was noted to have recurrent, prolonged generalised tonic clonic seizures, and the patient was treated with multiple doses of intravenous lorazepam and a 20 mg/kg loading dose of levetiracetam. The patient required endotracheal intubation due to respiratory failure in the setting of these seizures and seizure treatments. Her laboratory workup, including electrolytes, liver function tests and complete blood count, was normal. The respiratory viral PCR panel via nasal swab was positive for influenza type B. The patient was transferred to PICU on a mechanical ventilator with propofol infusion for sedation. On arrival to the PICU, the child's vital signs were stable, but her Glasgow coma score was low off sedation, and her pupillary response was sluggish to light bilaterally. Fever and seizures recurred. The patient was treated with additional intravenous lorazepam and an intravenous loading dose of fosphenytoin with subsequent resolution of clinical seizures. The neurology consultation service recommended continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and maintenance dosing of levetiracetam. EEG was consistent with moderate to severe encephalopathy. There were no seizures during the entirety of her 36-hour recording. Despite discontinuation of sedation on hospital day 1, the child remained unresponsive with weak cough and gag reflexes for the initial 4 days of her admission. The patient had generalised hypotonia and decreased strength in all extremities. Following receipt of steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), there was a gradual improvement in her neurological status starting with spontaneous eye opening and an improved cough/gag reflex. At the time of her extubation on hospital day 12, there were already concerns about her vision. Subsequent ophthalmology exam was significant for minimal pupillary response to light and diffuse visual field restriction in total superior temporal, inferior temporal, superior nasal, inferior nasal fields. The patient had no perception of bright light consistent with total blindness. Perimetry and visual evoked potentials were attempted but not completed as child was younger and not cooperative. By the time of discharge on hospital day 16, she was walking, talking and eating food by mouth; however, the patient still had visual impairment and could not track or reach objects. Blood glucose and serum electrolytes were within normal limits throughout her hospitalisation. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP) was less than 0.5 mg/dL on admission. CRP was as high as 5.3 mg/dL on hospital day 2, which trended down to normal from hospital day 3. Antinuclear antibody screen was negative, complement levels (C3 and C4) were within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed right upper lobe and left lobe atelectasis, with resolution within few days while intubated. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)/aquaporin-4-IgG in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were negative, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody assay in serum was negative. CSF analysis was normal with nucleated cells of 3/cubic mm, mildly elevated protein at 85 mg/dL and normal glucose at 66 mg/dL. The CSF meningitis/encephalitis PCR panel was negative. A CT scan of her brain on admission showed mild hypodensities in the left temporal and parietal lobes. Subsequent MRI of the brain showed bilateral, symmetric diffusion restriction of the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, thalami, pons and regions of the peripheral cortex. [MRI brain findings in a patient with influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy showing the involvement of bilateral putamen and thalami. It showed diffusion restriction in diffusion weighted image. It showed diffusion restriction in apparent diffusion coefficient image]. Faint enhancement of the posterior optic nerves was observed bilaterally on the post-contrast images. [MRI brain with and without contrast findings in a patient with influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy showing enhancement of the posterior optic nerves bilaterally]. MRI C-spine was normal without any demyelinating changes. She was also found to be heterozygous for RAN binding protein 2 (RANBP2) gene mutation on further diagnostic investigation. The working diagnosis at this point was acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) secondary to influenza B infection. The differential diagnosis included NMO, MOG antibody associated encephalopathy, vasculitis and bacterial meningitis. Appropriate workup for these alternative diagnoses was negative. The patient was treated for influenza B infection with oseltamivir for 5 days. The patient was also empirically treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin until blood, urine and CSF cultures returned negative. Given the working diagnosis of ANE, the patient was given pulse dose steroid therapy with methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day from hospital days 3-7 followed by a steroid taper over 3 weeks. The patient was also treated with 0.5 g/kg/day IVIG from hospital days 7-10. The patient continued to improve after the hospital discharge, and within a month, The patient had subjectively regained full vision. At her follow-up visit with neurology, The patient was able to identify colours, and The patient could track objects. Visual acuity testing in neurology clinic was limited as the patient did not cooperate with age appropriate visual acuity testing using the tumbling E vision chart. The patient's parents expressed concerns at that appointment for her learning, stating that it seemed difficult for her to retain new information. Neuropsychology evaluation was scheduled. Patient was scheduled to have an ophthalmology appointment the following week but was then lost to follow-up. The child and her family members were referred to genetics clinic, pending additional genetic testing at the time of this case report. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The author commented, ""Influenza-associated neurological manifestations vary from encephalitis/encephalopathy, myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and Reye's syndrome, to ANE. Influenza type A is the predominant cause of IAE in children. IAE is more frequently reported in country than the rest of the world. The incidence of influenza-related neurological complications was 4 cases per 100 000 child-years in the country. Abrupt onset of seizures and loss of consciousness following a short duration of fever are the most common manifestations of IAE. CSF analysis may reveal pleocytosis and/or increased protein; however, normal CSF analysis and negative RT-PCR do not rule out IAE. CT and/or MRI may show diffuse cerebral oedema. Neuroimaging in ANE further shows symmetric necrosis of thalami, cortex, internal capsule and brain stem structures. MRI findings in our index patient were consistent with ANE. Cytokine-mediated vascular inflammation and parenchymal cell apoptosis are the most proposed pathophysiological mechanisms for IAE. While our patient's neurological improvement correlated with receipt of these treatments, it is difficult to interpret whether the treatments caused the improvement or if her improvement was due to the natural course of the illness. Larger studies are needed to determine the efficacy of steroids and IVIG in IAE. Our index case was also found to be heterozygous for RANBP2 gene mutation. This genetic mutation was well studied and was found to be associated with recurrent and familial cases of ANE. Visual defects such as uveitis, optic neuritis, neuroretinitis, retinal infarction and lateral geniculate body (visual pathway relay centre in thalamus) infarction have been reported in paediatric patients with influenza. Blindness in our patient is likely explained by the combination of optic nerve enhancement and ANE affecting the lateral geniculate bodies. Presence of isolated optic nerve enhancement without optic disc oedema in our index case was not reported in previous studies. It was described a child diagnosed with IAE due to influenza B virus infection who developed temporary visual impairment as a sequela.""

Item #18:  CDC asked to report any Bell's Palsy symptoms (also trigeminal neuralgia is related to BP).  48 hrs post vax, mid-afternoon Sat, Feb 6th: Suddenly unable to comprehend book I was reading;  and  there was a physical sensation of irritation just inside my skull, wrapping around my brain (meninges?) -  it did not intrude into brain.  Felt lack of 'presence' in room.  Slightly unstable on my feet.  Believed these were related to vaccine, would soon abate, but, also, that this would be no way to go through life!   These lasted 2-3 hours.  (I neither drink alcohol or take recreational drugs.)  About that time, a 'twinging' precursor to trigeminal neuralgia began �  uncertain whether it was TN?  Recurred every 3 hrs.  But then awakened at 6:30 a.m. by two painful TN jabs, repeated more strongly at 9:40 a,m.  At about 12:30 pm, return of light 'twinging' sensation, then nothing � no recurrence.  3rd TN episode in 3 years, the briefest, the only one not requiring oxcarbazepine.  Checked for Bell's Palsy symptoms (which I've never had):  The left side of my mouth wasn't producing any saliva at all � none.  This improved very slowly, continuing for 5 or 6 days; by far the longest lasting symptom.  About Monday, the 8th, experienced an expanded  time warp driving to library � took forever to reach two roundabouts.  Lucid, alert, vision & reactions normal.  Speed was a mile or two above limit.  No euphoria or nystagmus.  At library, conversation and work seemed normal.  Around the same time I had about an 18 hour complete memory loss with regard to medications.  Two dose periods in succession.    On Monday, Feb 8th, I called our 4 day a week neurologist.  He said the symptoms    were an immune response to the vaccine but that he's never seen them together before.  It was scary.  I'm not going to take the second dose at this time.  And will depend upon PCP.       Filling out this form because you've asked about any adverse reaction related to Bell's Palsy (which TN is closely related to).  I wonder how many others have experienced trigeminal neuralgia symptoms following vaccination?  It's a cumulative disease and devastating in advanced forms.  :-(",,,,,,,,,Y,02/04/2021,02/06/2021,2,None,OTH,,Meds and Supps:        Primidone -  HCTZ � Warfarin � Amlodipine -  Alprazolam � Acyclovir - Acetaminophen - Latanaprost -  Multi-vitamin - Vit C � Magnesium � Glucosomine - Vit D3 - AREDS Eye complex,None,"Heart Disease, HPB, ET",,,2,02/12/2021,,Y,,None

Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon's lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O's as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient's current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient's most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG <180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5.

COMPARISON: None.   TECHNIQUE: This examination was performed using a duplex scanner combining Doppler and  real-time.  Multiple Doppler samples were obtained at different points along the carotid  arteries in the neck.  Special attention was paid to the proximal portions of both internal  carotid arteries. The Doppler samples were analyzed using a spectral analyzer.   FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis was within the common  carotid arteries. There is mild calcification of the bilateral common carotid arteries and  carotid bulbs.   Peak systolic velocities within the proximal, mid and distal right ICA are 56 cm/s, 86 cm/s and   103 cm/sec, respectively. Peak systolic velocities within the proximal, mid and distal left  ICA are 87 cm/s, 82 cm/s and 85 cm/sec, respectively.   The ICA to CCA ratio on the right is 1.9. The ICA to CCA ratio on the left is 1.3.   Anterograde flow is demonstrated in both vertebral arteries.

I applied a bit of hydrocortisone to the area and the itching subsided.  The next morning, Monday, the area was more filled in with pink and there was a new peninsula of pink descending about 2"" below the circle. It throbbed and itched when I first got up. Again there was another surge of itching in the late afternoon. I applied hydrocortisone twice. Tuesday there was no change in the rash or itching in the morning, but no second surge of itching in the afternoon. I messaged my Primary Physician's office and heard back that this could be a reaction to the vaccine, and that I should apply cold compresses to the area. I did.

1309765,03/12/2021,IN,64.0,64,,F,,"3 days ; This letter is to inform you of the unfortunate series of events that landed me in hospital on Friday, January 8, 2021. You denied a brain MRI on January 4th that was an emergent situation, mainly because you had no information about what was happening. I am going to lay out the entire timeline of events, as there are more bills coming.  First, I want to give you some background: I am an EXTREMELY fit 64 year old. I work out 6 days a week doing workouts that most 25 year old could not do. I see my OB/GY once a year for my annual checkup. My blood pressure has never been above 110-115/60-70. For my entire adult life, I have never had any serious illness. I should be a dream case for any insurer.  I am married to a Board-certified physician in spinal cord injury medicine, EMG, and Neuromuscular Medicine. Together we run the top EMG lab. We have close relationships with the top specialists, which allowed me access to them very quickly.  Here is the timeline:  On Sunday, December 27, 2020, I was cleaning the baseboards in the bedroom walking backwards. I turned around and hit my left temple HARD on the TV mounted on the wall. I did not pass out, but I actually felt my brain hit the right side of my head from the force. I called my husband and we decided to keep a close watch on me to be sure I did not have a subdural hematoma. For the entire following week, I just had a terrible headache and neck pain. He thought I had a whiplash sort of injury.  On Saturday, 1/2/21, I received my first Moderna Covid vaccine.  On Monday, 1/4/21, I drove to work. I noticed my vision was a little blurry cut chalked it up to needing new contact lenses. When I got in the car and started driving home, I realized that I had complete and total double vision. I only got home by covering one eye to see the road. I was petrified.  On Tuesday morning, my husband called Dr, concussion specialist. He told me to schedule a brain MRI asap. I scheduled it for Friday, 1/8 so company could get approval from you. When we told Dr it was scheduled for Friday, he said I needed it sooner than that, and that he would call in the kind of images he wanted. My friend, who runs the company, got me in that day, and I had an appointment with Dr the following morning, Wednesday, 1/6.   I had a very thorough exam with Dr, who said I had a concussion with a partial 6th nerve palsy (double vision). He DID say it was unusual to develop 6th nerve palsy a week after I hit my head, but we were still thinking it was from the concussion.  On Friday, 1/8, I was driving to the office with my husband (still could not drive). I ate a breakfast sandwich in the car, and when I went to look in the mirror to see if I had food in my teeth, I noticed I could not move the right side of my mouth. By the time we got to the office, I had a palsy on the entire right side of my face. We called Dr who advised that I go to the ER immediately, as 7th nerve palsy is really not associated with a concussion.  We cancelled our patients and he drove me the ER. There I saw Dr, the ER doc, who took one look at me and said I had Bell's palsy. They started taking my vitals and my blood pressure was 220/110! They thought I was having a stroke! They immediately started an IV with medication to reduce my blood pressure. The neurologist came in and ordered another brain MRI with smaller slices than the 1st one to make sure we were not missing anything. He also ordered an MRA. They were all normal. They admitted me to the hospital. After consultation with the Internal Medicine doc, they decided I needed a spina; tap to rule of the many very serious things associated with Bell's palsy. Everything was negative. I was discharged at 1 pm on Sunday, 1/7.  I had a follow up with Dr on Wednesday, 1/13.  We received a call from Dr who insisted on taking over my case, as he knows my husband very well. I had a consultation with him on Wednesday, 1/13. I gave him the entire timeline of events. I was stunned to hear his opinion: BOTH the 6th nerve palsy AND the 7th nerve palsy were caused by my Covid vaccine. He said he had seen 4 patients in the last 10 days who all developed palsies after their vaccines. They were all Pfizer vaccines, and I was the first Moderna one he had seen.   I have since come under the care of Dr who is monitoring my blood pressure. The double vision has resolved, and the Bell's palsy is about 90% improved. I am scheduled for my 2nd vaccine this Sunday, 1/31/ Both Dr want me to go ahead and take it. I have a prescription of Clonidine on hand in case my blood pressure spikes again. It has come back down to about 136/84, which is still high for me. I am absolutely convinced that the blood pressure issue is also from the vaccine. There is no other explanation for my blood pressure doubling.  I hope this letter explains the very unfortunate consequences of my Covid vaccine. I have included the progress notes from dr with this letter.

It was very itchy for about 8 hrs and then it was only sporadic at best.  The rash was very red at beginning but has faded continually since.  The area is a very distinct oval or circular shape, approx. 4 inches in diameter.

I then went to urgent care and on the way there my heart was pounding and racing. After I was admitted they told me that I had tachycardia and my blood pressure was high (I do not usually have high blood pressure). They did an EKG at urgent care and noticed small changes. I was then sent to the ER and was given IV Benadryl and oral steroids. I was put on a heart monitor, and they were able to get my heart rate to go down, but a few hours later it jumped back up. At that point I was referred to a cardiologist and given a prescription for steroids, and then I was discharged. I saw the cardiologist 2 days later, during those two days I still experienced red hot spots on my arm, shortness of breath, Tachycardia, and shivering. When I went to the cardiologist, they did another EKG and said I still have tachycardia and did some bloodwork.
