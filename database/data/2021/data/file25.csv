At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.

I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn't. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting.

My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back.

It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours.

Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs.

Meanwhile my right eye just wanted to stay closed, so then I couldn?t see at all.

After the eyelid was released the eye was very sore . I called the nurse line and they recommended I be seen within 24 hours. I saw the doctor this morning not related at all to the vaccination facility. She said it sounded like an ocular muscle spasm.

I went to the doctor on January 11th and he and two other doctors diagnosed it as Shingles.  Their best opinion was that while it wasn't caused by the COVID vaccine, the stress on my body from getting the vaccine triggered the shingles virus and made it active.  I was given Valtrex to take for 10 days.  I also  got some CBD pills and oil to help lessen the rash.  I went back for a recheck on  January 26th.

The lights were very bad and bright flourescent so admittedly I was bothered by them or it could have been the beginning of the whooseyness  from the shot. My husband picked me up in the car out front, we were driving and I began to get pressure in my sinuses and mostly the sides of my nose. I did have some head congestion but this feeling had never happened (it should be noted I had negative covid tests to make sure stuffy head was nog covid related). Then I felt pressure in my ears and my face began to feel flush as my cheeks. All of this began at about 35 minutes after the injection. Then my lips began to feel strange. It was a cross between tingly and numb. I made as many faces in the car makeup mirror to make sure my face muscles were moving properly And they were. But there was definitely numbness occurring in my mouth. Tingly-numbness. This all happened within about 10 min of the first onset. Then I noticed some splotchiness on my lower arms. Mostly my left (shot was given in right- no redness at the injection site). I also got some splochiness on my chest and neck. Cheeks were also ruddy and flush. I did NOT have any problem breathing or swallowing at anytime. Nor did my pulse race (other than from a pit of panic from nerves over the reaction). I didnt have a thermometer but don?t think I had a fever either. We pulled over and I called a nurse on call. She told me if things worsened to go to hospital. I did have a little bit of the feeling you get when you are about to pass out and you feel like things are closing in a bit. But it never got past about a 2 on a scale of 1-10.

The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/�L, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/�L.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.

The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103�F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/�L.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/�L.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/�L.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3+ blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.

Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind.

Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn't want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it's on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine.

Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn't have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn't remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days.

Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again.

She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn't miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn't urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn't handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn't sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn't think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn't get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty.

Wasn't 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg.

Patient's Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it's a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report.

All were negative and progressed to a microdose of the vaccine.  Continued to have no reaction so remaining dose was administered.  I waited 2 hours in clinic and experienced some mild pruritic symptoms.  Took 2 zytrtec and went home.  the next day experienced some throat swelling with shortness of breath.  Took additional allergy medication and contacted Dr.  He prescribed prednisone and up to 4 allergy tabs a day.  I developed increased shortness of breath, hives on my tongue which developed into ulcerations.  The waves of throat swelling would come every 4 hours or so.  Was able to manage with oral agents, did not administer the prescribed epi-pen.  These symptoms started on that Tuesday and were severe enough to keep me home from work until Feb 15th (I work Monday/Wednesday).  Throat swelling and coughing persists but it markedly improved.   Now understand I have a non-IGE mediated allergy to PEG.   Patient wanted to receive the COVID vaccine so was seen by an allergist given previous history of possible polyethylene glycol allergy.  Following review and discussion of risks patient was scheduled to receive a test dose.  Provider notes as follows:  She has had several occasions where she has developed shortness of breath and ""generally not feeling well,"" within 1 to 2 hours of taking MiraLAX.  She has not had any reactions to any prior injectable medications or vaccinations.  Due to this MiraLAX potential allergy there is a contraindication to receiving the Pfizer or my during a Covid vaccine.  What I have recommended since she would like to be vaccinated is to have her to return to clinic at which time we will do skin testing with skin prick and intradermal to polyethylene glycol as well as polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80.  If the allergy testing to polyethylene clean glycol is negative we will then give her graded dosing of the COVID-19 vaccine and monitor her in clinic.  If the polyethylene glycol is positive but the polysorbate testing are negative she may be a candidate for receiving one of the newer vaccines which are yet to be on the market.     The patient was seen today for a new problem which is polyethylene glycol allergy and the need for COVID-19 vaccination.  She will return for testing to the vaccine components and then intramuscular graded challenge if necessary.     Prior to the graded challenge skin prick testing to MiraLAX was completed which was negative.  Skin prick testing and intradermal testing was also completed for Solu-Medrol, Depo-Medrol and triamcinolone.  The Depo-Medrol contains polyethylene glycol, the triamcinolone contains polysorbate 80 and the Solu-Medrol functions as a control without any polyethylene glycol or polysorbate.  All skin prick and intradermal testing was negative.  An ~10% dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was given and the patient was monitored for 30 minutes. The remaining ~90% of the COVID-19 vaccine was then given  and the patient was monitored for an additional 90 minutes.

This short study was conducted at the neuromuscular clinic from 2001 to 2005.   The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient was in good health prior to the onset of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), did not have any acute illness, systemic infections, diabetes mellitus, history of alcohol abuse, or exposure any known neurotoxins, and there was no family history of neuropathy. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; dose, anatomical location, indication and route of administration: not reported). The batch number was not reported.   On an unspecified date, seven days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient experienced sensation of burning, tingling, and itching over the trunk. The patient underwent detailed history, general and neurological examinations, electrodiagnostic and laboratory studies, including spinal fluid, complete blood count, metabolic panel, serology for autoimmune disorders, Lyme serology, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), serum immune fixation, thyroid studies, glucose and HbA1C, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine.  On an unspecified date, over the next ten days, the patient developed difficulty chewing, bilateral facial weakness and diplopia, along with tingling and numbness in feet and hands, mild weakness in limbs, and gait difficulty. All tendon reflexes were absent, and sensations were normal. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed elevated protein (142 mg/dl) with two lymphocytes and normal glucose and cell count. Other laboratory and imaging studies were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies were unremarkable except for mild impersistence of median nerve F waves (four of ten) with normal latencies. Needle electromyogram (EMG) testing of distal lower extremity muscles was unremarkable. Blink reflex showed absent R1 and R2 responses bilaterally and normal response with direct facial stimulation, suggesting a proximal conduction block. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subtle enhancement of facial nerves.   On an unspecified date, he was treated with a 5-day course of immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 0.4 g/kg per day.   On an unspecified date, the patient improved.   On an unspecified date, four weeks later, the patient noted increasing numbness in toes and hands as well as increasing weakness in ankles with decreased balance and gait difficulty. Examination showed weakness with grade four medical research council (MRC) strength in intrinsic hand muscles, hip flexors, and ankle dorsiflexion. Muscle stretch reflexes were diminished in the arms and absent at knees and ankles. Vibration and pin sensation were diminished in feet with preserved proprioception. Electrodiagnostic findings for median motor were: distal motor latency (DL) (ms): 5.3, amplitude (amp): 3.5, conduction velocity (CV) (m/s): 34.21 and F wave latency (ms): 59; for peroneal motor: right (rt): DL (ms): 7.5, amp: 0.8, CV (m/s): 41.22 and F wave latency (ms): No response (NR), left (lt): DL (ms): 6.4, amp: 1.1, CV (m/s): 30.42 and F wave latency (ms): NR; for tibial motor: rt: DL (ms): 6.6, Amp: 3.7, CV (m/s): 34, F wave latency (ms): 84, lt: DL (ms): 5.8, amp: 5.6, CV (m/s): 30 and F wave latency (ms): 78; and for ulnar motor: DL (ms): 3.8, amp: 8.6, CV (m/s): 48, 43, 60, F wave latency (ms): 38. Sural amplitude for lt was 13 �V and rt: 11 �V, median sensory amplitude and ulnar sensory amplitude were: NR. Electrodiagnostic studies showed widespread abnormalities, indicating a demyelinating polyneuropathy. Median and ulnar sensory potentials were absent, and sural sensory potentials were preserved.   On an unspecified date, the patient was treated with intravenous Gammaglobulin (immunoglobulin g human) (IVIG) at a dose of 1 g/kg monthly for four months.  On an unspecified date, the patient improved promptly.   On an unspecified date, he experienced another relapse, which responded to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1000 mg per week (mg/wk) and developed gastrointestinal side effects. Thereafter, he was treated with monthly immunoglobulin (IVIG), and oral Mycophenolate (mycophenolate mofetil) at a dose of 1 g two times a day (bid).   On an unspecified date, at the 36-month follow-up, the patient showed no deficit. He had not required IVIG for one year and remained free of relapses.  At the time of initial reporting, the patient recovered from event.  The reporter assessed the event as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. Physician reported that the patient who was otherwise healthy, developed CIDP with rapid onset in close proximity to influenza vaccination, suggesting a plausible relationship between the immunization and the induction of CIDP, however the plausible relationship was not clear.  In conclusion, the relationship between immunization, particularly influenza vaccination, and the development of acquired demyelinating neuropathies has been discussed in the literature, mostly in the context of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Although the concern that CIDP might follow influenza vaccination similar to Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) might seem intuitive, there were no clearly documented cases in the literature of CIDP with abrupt onset within a few days after influenza vaccination. Our patient, who was otherwise healthy, developed CIDP with rapid onset in close proximity to influenza vaccination, suggesting a plausible relationship between the immunization and the induction of CIDP. Rapid onset resembling GBS occurs in about 15 percent to 20 percent of cases of CIDP. It was possible that antecedent events such as immunization are more likely in such patients, but that has not been systematically evaluated. In contrast to GBS, which was a monophasic illness, how a single event such as immunization may trigger induction of a relapsing or chronic immune-mediated disorder such as CIDP is not known.   This case is linked to cases 202101474 and 202101475 (the same literature article).

The patient was in good health prior to the onset of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and did not have any acute illness or systemic infections, diabetes mellitus, history of alcohol abuse, or exposure to any known neurotoxins.

The patient had no relevant medical history. He was in good health prior to the onset of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and did not have any acute illness or systemic infections, diabetes mellitus, history of alcohol abuse, or exposure to any known neurotoxins. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. There was no family history of neuropathy.  On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; dose, route of administration, anatomical location and indication: not reported). The batch number was not reported.   On an unspecified date, two days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient developed tingling in the hands, followed by progressive weakness, which progressed over two weeks, in his arms and legs.  On an unknown date, the patient started five-day course treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) over four weeks.   On an unknown date, patient improved.  On an unspecified date, a month later, the patient experienced more gradual worsening of weakness over six weeks. The patient was unable to walk or stand, even with support.   On an unknown date, the patient underwent detailed history, general and neurological examinations, electrodiagnostic and laboratory studies, including spinal fluid, complete blood count, metabolic panel, serology for autoimmune disorders, Lyme serology, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), serum immune fixation, thyroid studies, glucose and HbA1C, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine. Examination showed marked weakness in proximal and distal muscles of all extremities, with absent muscle stretch reflexes. The patient's tendon reflexes were all absent. Vibration was diminished in the toes, and other sensations were intact. Electrodiagnostic findings for median motor were: right (rt) distal motor latency (DL) (ms): 9.3, rt: amplitude (Amp) (mV): 1.6, rt: conduction velocity (CV) (m/s): 24, 26 and rt: F wave latency (ms): 54; for peroneal motor: rt: DL (ms): 6.7, rt: Amp (mV): 0.4, rt: CV (m/s): 31, 31 and rt: F wave latency (ms): No response (NR); for tibial motor: rt: DL (ms): 8.3, rt: Amp (mV): 0.7, rt: CV (m/s): 26, rt: F wave latency (ms): NR and for ulnar motor: rt: DL (ms): 4.3, rt: Amp (mV): 3.5, rt: (CV) (m/s): 43, 37, 43, rt: F wave latency (ms): 47. Sural amplitude for left (lt) and rt: NR, median sensory amplitude was: NR and ulnar sensory amplitude was 2.6 mV. Needle Electromyography (EMG) showed fibrillation potentials and loss of motor unit potentials in the distal upper and lower extremity muscles. Electrodiagnostic studies showed widespread abnormalities, indicating a demyelinating polyneuropathy. Many nerves showed findings suggestive of primary demyelination namely temporal dispersion or conduction block, marked reduction of conduction velocity, prolongation or absent F waves, prolonged distal motor latencies, and met the commonly accepted criteria for diagnosis of CIDP. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed elevated protein (127,3 mg/dl), with normal glucose and cell count. Other laboratory and imaging studies were normal.   On an unknown date, the patient was treated monthly with IVIG at dose of 1 g/kg and oral Mycophenalate (mycophenolate mofetil) at dose of 1000 mg, twice a day (bid).  On an unknown date, after six months IVIG was discontinued.   On an unspecified date, at the 16-month follow-up, the patient showed normal gait and only mild weakness of intrinsic hand muscles (grade 4 Medical Research Council (MRC)).  At the time of initial reporting, the patient was recovering from event.   The relationship between immunization, particularly influenza vaccination, and the development of acquired demyelinating neuropathies has been discussed in the literature, mostly in the context of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The plausible relationship between CIDP and vaccination was less clear than between GBS and vaccination. Patients, who were otherwise healthy, developed CIDP with rapid onset in close proximity to influenza vaccination, suggesting a plausible relationship between the immunization and the induction of CIDP. Rapid onset resembling GBS occurs in about 15 percent to 20 percent of cases of CIDP. It was possible that antecedent events such as immunization were more likely in such patients, but that had not been systematically evaluated. In contrast to GBS, which was a monophasic illness, how a single event such as immunization may trigger induction of a relapsing or chronic immune-mediated disorder such as CIDP was not known.  The event of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.

The aim of this study was to describe three patients who developed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) with rapid onset in close proximity to influenza vaccination followed by relapsing or chronic course. Patients were evaluated at the neuromuscular clinic from 2001 to 2005. The patients underwent detailed history, general and neurological examinations, electrodiagnostic and laboratory studies, including spinal fluid, complete blood count, metabolic panel, serology for autoimmune disorders, Lyme serology, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), serum immune fixation, thyroid studies, glucose and HbA1C, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine.  The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient was in good health and had no acute illness or systemic infections. The patient had no diabetes mellitus, history of alcohol abuse, or exposure to any known neurotoxins and had no family history of neuropathy. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; dose, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) for influenza vaccination. The batch number was not reported.  On an unknown date, 21 days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient experienced severe pain in a band like distribution in the mid thoracic region.  On an unknown date, four days later, the patient experienced progressive weakness and numbness which progressed over six weeks, in her legs and hands. The patient was able to take a few steps with a walker, and she had marked weakness in proximal and distal muscles of upper and lower extremities. Muscle stretch reflexes were absent in the legs and diminished in the arms. Vibration was absent in the feet, but proprioception and pin sensation were intact. Gait was broad based and ataxic.   On an unknown date, the patient started a five-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), but did not improve. The patient was then treated with weekly pulse oral prednisone starting at dose of 150 mg/wk for two months followed by a slow taper to 20 mg/wk.  On unknown date, CSF protein was elevated (136 mg/dl), with normal glucose and cell count. Other laboratory and imaging studies were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies showed evidence of demyelinating polyneuropathy. These values indicated primary demyelination: sural amplitude showed no response, peroneal motor distal latency (DL) was 11 ms (right) and 12.2 ms (left), amplitude (AMP) was 0.5 mV (right) and 0.3 mV (left), and conduction velocity (CV)  in  different segments revealed  21, 22 m/s (right) and 22, 23 m/s (left). Tibial motor DL was 10.7ms (right) and 9.9 ms (left), AMP was 2 mV (right) and 2.3 mV (left), and CV in different segments was 27 m/s (right) and 34 m/s (left) while F wave latency showed no response (NP) (right) and 120 ms (left). Ulnar motor DL revealed 5.1 ms (right and left), amplitude was 5.1 mV (right) and 3.8 mV (left), CV was 37, 34 and 30 m/s (right) and 35, 36 and 38 (left), while F wave latency was 50 (right) and 48 (left). Many nerves showed findings suggestive of primary demyelination, namely temporal dispersion or conduction block, marked reduction of conduction velocity, prolongation or absent F waves, prolonged distal motor latencies, and met the commonly accepted criteria for diagnosis of CIDP. This patient had second relapse and progressive course.   On an unknown date, at 14-months follow-up, the patient was able to ambulate without assistance, and she has mild weakness (grade 4 MRC) in deltoid, intrinsic hand muscles, and hip flexion. Reflexes remain absent in the lower extremities.  On an unknown date, at 16-months follow-up, the patient was able to ambulate independently and had mild weakness in arms.  At the time of initial reporting, the patient was recovering from the event.  The author assessed the event as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. The patient who was otherwise healthy, developed CIDP with rapid onset in close proximity to influenza vaccination, suggesting a plausible relationship between the immunization and the induction of CIDP.

A low procalcitonin should prompt the  investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status.  Repeat low  or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic  de-escalation or discontinuation.

1066831,03/02/2021,,71.0,71,,F,,"Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2+ to 3 and slightly brisk, 1+ at both ankles and 1+ and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.

She did complain of some numbness and pain in the right hemibody down to the leg.  Really nothing in the arm.  She has feels her balance has been off.  Spinal fluid analysis at this time is normal to date.  The right peroneal amplitudes are low with a borderline distal latency borderline conduction velocity and no late response.  Peroneal response in the tibialis anterior was normal in amplitude and velocity.  Right tibial median and ulnar amplitudes are normal with normal distal latencies normal conduction velocities and normal late responses.  The right sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude is normal with a normal velocity as is the right median sensory nerve action potential, right ulnar sensory potential and right superficial radial sensory nerve action potential amplitude and velocity.  EMG of all of the following muscles reveal no spontaneous activity full recruitment on maximal effort of normal-appearing motor units and no polyphasia.  These muscles included the right deltoid, triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, EDC, FDI, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus.  EMG of thoracic paraspinal musculature is unremarkable.  Impression electrical findings do not reveal any nerve muscle or motor neuron issue.

Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.

She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.

Scattered areas of chronic infarction with advanced underlying microvascular ischemic change, progressed from 2010. MRI CERVICAL SPINE WO CONTRAST, February 12, 2021 8:31 PM IMPRESSION:1. Significantly motion degraded exam, limiting evaluation for the ability to quantify areas of canal and foraminal narrowing as well as areas of potential cord signal abnormality. 2. Within these limitations, there is a questionable focus of cord signal abnormality at the C5-6 level secondary to degenerative change with moderate-severe canal narrowing at the C5-6 level, though this is only seen on the sagittal STIR sequence without definite correlate on the additional sequences (series 2, image 7). Unclear if this reflects a focus of compressive myelopathy or artifact. No other focus of gross cord signal abnormality, within limitations of motion artifact. Consider repeat examination to further evaluate this region if the patient is better able to tolerate a repeat exam. 3. Additional degenerative findings regarding the spinal canal and neural foramina, detailed above. MRI THORACIC SPINE WO CONTRAST, February 12, 2021 8:32 PM IMPRESSION: 1.

Abnormal T2/STIR hyperintense marrow signal and enhancement in the left iliac bone (series 5, image 4 and series 21, image 19). Unclear if this reflects degenerative change, sequela of prior trauma, postoperative change, or potentially a metastatic lesion. Consider further evaluation with dedicated CT pelvis to assess bony change in this region, if clinically indicated. 5. Additional foci of abnormal marrow signal and enhancement involving the bilateral sacral ala S1 may be posttraumatic in etiology secondary to sacral insufficiency fractures versus degenerative change.

The patient has a history of bioprosthetic mitral valve, hypertension, prior UTI who presents to our lab as a transfer from Hospital for inpatient evaluation of acute onset bilateral lower extremity weakness s/p COVID vaccine.Physical examination:  There is reduced bulk and tone throughout  Motor strength is 4/5 in bilateral upper; 3/5 b/l hip flexors, 5/5 dorsi/plantar flexion. Sensation is intact to all modalities throughout. Deep tendon reflexes are 3/4 in bilateral upper and absent in bilateral lower extremities. Plantar response is upgoing bilaterally.SUMMARY: Motor nerve conduction studies were performed on the left median, ulnar, peroneal, and tibial nerves.  The left median nerve revealed a mildly prolonged latency with slowed conduction velocity and normal amplitude. The left ulnar nerve reveal a normal latency with mildly slow conduction velocity and mildly reduced amplitudes. The left peroneal nerve revealed normal amplitude with normal latency and mildly slowed conduction velocity. The left tibial nerve revealed mildly reduced amplitude with normal latency and mildly slowed conduction velocity.   F-wave latencies were within normal limits.  Sensory nerve conduction studies were performed on the left median, ulnar, radial, and sural nerves. All studies revealed a mildly slowed conduction velocity with the left median slowing a delayed peak latency and reduced amplitude, the left ulnar nerve showing normal amplitude with mildly delayed peak latency, and the left radial with severely reduced amplitudes and normal peak latency. The left sural response was absent. H-wave reflexes were not performed. A concentric needle EMG examination was performed on left upper and lower extremities. Deltoid, biceps, triceps, pronator teres, first dorsal interosseus as well as vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus longus, and gastrocnemius muscles were sampled.  All muscles revealed normal insertional activity, no abnormal spontaneous activity, and normal voluntary MUAPs with a full recruitment pattern consistent with effort.  Patient was on anticoagulation, needle testing of paraspinous muscles was deferred.CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:This study shows evidence of a mild generalized sensorimotor axonal neuropathy. Specifically, there is no evidence of any demyelinating processes as may be seen in AIDP. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any obvious radiculopathy or myopathic process.Overall the electrical abnormalities do not commensurate with the patient's clinical presentation of inability to ambulate without support due to weakness in legs.

I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards.

There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They've prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week.
