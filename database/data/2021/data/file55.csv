He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn't form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told. He has noted yesterday that he could not close his eyes unless he did it manually, also he notes the way his voice sounds is different to him. He has not appreciated any weakness of his arms or legs. He is able to lift up his head off the bed without trouble. He does not think he has a hard time swallowing or breathing per se however he does describe that he is more ""aware"" of his breathing. He describes paresthesias of his face and around his mouth. No recent URI or diarrheal/GI illness, he did receive the Johnson & Johnson COVID -19 vaccine March 31st. Seen and evaluated in the ED with ed staff. He does report he recently ran a virtual type marathon over the course of 16 days.

She did not wash her hand that had my blood on it, and proceeded to try to give me my paperwork with blood on it to hand off to the person checking clients out.

I was due for my 2nd one on the 15th, however I was out of town and rescheduled the 2nd dosage, CT three days later.  The woman who gave me the shot made a noise when she injected me, something like ""oh or oops"" and suddenly I felt the vaccine run quickly down my arm.  She reached for something to dry it up and said nothing.  I said, was that vaccine running down my arm?  She said yes, but they put more than enough in the syringe so you are fine.  I asked how do you know that?  She didn't respond, told me to wait 15 minutes and that everything would be fine.  The next day, concerned because I have underlying conditions, I called pharmacy back.  The pharmacy manager was unaware of the event and took down my information.  Someone called me back a few minutes later and said they had no direction on what to do next, that they needed to reach out to pharmacy Corporate to report it and the CDC for guidance.  2 days later and I have heard nothing.  I called them back and pharmacy told me that they were waiting on direction, when I asked when I would hear back from them, they had no answer.  I then called the CDC number on the internet and spoke to someone who transferred me to a nurse who read information to me  and gave me directions to fill out an incident report on this website.  Part of what she read me (and then subsequently emailed me) stated that if 1/2 the dosage was given, that is fine, but if less than 1/2 (or if it can not be determined), that an additional vaccine should be given immediately in the opposite arm.  There is no way that the woman who gave me the shot knew how much went in my arm, her verbal reaction and the fact that she rushed me out of there is more than a little concerning.  I now don't know how well I am vaccinated, or what to do next.  Pharmacy told me that there is no data available on the adverse impacts of getting a 3rd vaccine at this point.

At the beginning of 2021, I began to enter the perimenopause stage.  My first gap was 37 days (normal period length/strength) and my second gap was 48 days.  My most period came after my first vaccine (at the end of 48 day gap).  I felt it was lighter and less discharge.  It ended after the normal 7 days.  I had 2 days of nothing (as to be expected).  I then began to have some brown discharge and mild cramping/discomfort.  This was not heavy enough for a pad or tampon, only a panty liner was needed.  The brown discharge occurred for about 3-4 days when small amounts of fresh, bright red blood began showing.  This has been occurring for the past 3 days, along with continued mild cramping/discomfort.  I am still in the middle of this discharge which now alternates between fresh blood drops and brown discharge.  I was originally scheduled to have my second dose tomorrow but have decided to postpone it as I don't want to chance blood clots.  Additionally, I am 45 years old and have had 3 children.  I have never had a menstrual cycle closer than 26 days apart.  I have NEVER had any blood discharge after my normal 7 day cycle.

She describes her headache as starting out as temporal and periorbital and then persisting as a frontal discomfort radiating to the back and down the neck.  Associated with this were complaints of blurry vision, photophobia and scotomata.  She denies any focal weakness or numbness/tingling. There was no vomiting or reports of seizures. She denies no recent problems finding words or bouts of confusion.  She denies a history of arrhythmia or palpitations.

She did not take any medication to pre-empt side effects such as NSAID, aspirin, H2 blocker, or Tylenol. Initially she developed a sore arm the night of the vaccination. Three days later the headache developed that did not respond to Tylenol PM although it helped her sleep.  She noted taking more than the recommended dose and had mouth dryness.   Patient denies any past history of COVID exposure and any illness c/w COVID where she was not tested.  She has never had her antibody titer checked.

Patients enter incorrect spelling frequently online when they register so spelling was just corrected and card was filled out. A vaccine clinic was being held in the middle of the store and when the card was filled out the date of the first dose was not noticed by myself. The nurse then administered the vaccine. When the papers were being entered in to the computer it was noticed the patient had just received his first dose one week prior. The patient made no mention was his last dose being so close together.  As soon as it was noticed corporate and Pfizer were both called. Pfizer claims this early dose will count as his second dose and he will not need a third dose. The patient did not express any adverse events during his observation period. Patient was called and told of the incident and expressed no new symptoms since dose. Patient was told to monitor for symptoms of adverse reaction.",,,,,,,,,U,04/14/2021,04/21/2021,7,,PHM,,,,,,,2,04/21/2021,,,,

These symptoms were as expected and seemed to subside within 48 hours. However, the nausea did not subside and for the following 2 weeks, I experienced significant 'waves' of nausea brought on by various factors such as car/plane (motion sickness), sun exposure (75 degrees on a beach for 20 minutes), various foods, etc.   Approximately one week after the vaccination, I had several glasses of red wine (4 glasses within an 8 hour time period). I am not a big drinker, so this amount caused me to feel intoxicated but not enough to be completely inebriated. I slept for 6 hours and woke up feeling 'drunk'- extremely dizzy and nauseous. I proceeded to vomit non-stop (approximately 7 times) over the following 6 hours and could not get the nausea under control. In fact, I had to have a physician prescribe Zofran to stop the dizziness and nausea or else I was going to need fluids administered. This is extremely unusual for me. It felt like the nausea I had been feeling from the vaccine had somehow been intensified 10-fold because of the wine. The Zofran helped immensely however, the nausea (slight at this point- back down to what it was prior to the alcohol episode) continued to persist for another two weeks and a half weeks. A few days ago, it felt like I 'turned the corner'.

Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient's troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4.

The pain level varies but has not subsided and continues to be noticeable when swinging my arms while walking. I didn?t strain, stretch, or otherwise stress my shoulder in any way that would cause this pain.    The pain has now become noticeable in the front of my shoulder, as well.   When I palpate the front of my shoulder, I feel distinct tenderness and pain.   My husband, who is an orthopedic surgeon, palpated the area and noted that the major pain seems to be coming from my biceps tendon.

Before receiving her vaccine I asked all proper questions regarding history of reactions or if she felt ill at the moment (proper screening questions). The only thing the patient mentioned was that she had asthma and had been feeling it acting up recently but no current issues at the moment. I assured her that it was still ok to receive vaccine according to CDC guidelines. After the vaccine, the patient started getting an immediate headache. Soon after that she felt a wave of nausea. Right after that patient began stating that she felt her asthma attack coming on. I triaged the patient accordingly and checked her breathing/circulation/etc. I also asked her if she felt like she couldn't breathe or if she felt her throat closing up. She could still talk and said she did not feel her throat closing up. She just kept saying it was her asthma attack coming on (the same feeling she gets with her asthma acts up). I grabbed epi-pen in hand and came to her side assessing the reaction. She then began to have a light wheeze/hyperventilation and stated her asthma was the culprit. I immediately ran to pharmacy and grabbed albuterol inhaler which she also stated she uses. She used the inhaler did 2 puffs immediately. I stood by her side and kept assessing the reaction. She still had a light wheeze and was very anxious/emotional. I kept asking if she felt her throat closing up and kept asking her questions to make sure she could still talk. She said she just felt very dehydrated and severe asthma symptoms. Stood by her side for a few more minutes kept assessing with Epi-pen in hand ready to inject.

Typically, before being vaccinated, I only used my rescue inhaler a few times a month, but I?ve had to use it four times a day since the symptoms started after I received the second dose of the covid vaccine. Three days ago I even went to immediate care to get tested for Covid, got an x-ray of my lungs and an EKG, but all the results were normal. My oxygen level is 98, but the bouts of shortness of breath and tightness in the chest  continue to occur a few times a day, and during those episodes i feel like I cannot get a good breath even though my oxygen level remains high. Between these bouts, I feel fine. The doctors that met with me in the immediate care clinic thought this is likely a reaction to the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine, since all the tests came back normal. I have and echocardiogram and a chest CT scheduled in early May, but I will try to get these tests sooner.  I do not have the typical side effects of the vaccine, such as fever, body aches, headache or nausea. I do not have rashes or swelling of lymph nodes. Episodes of shortness of breath that are sometimes accompanied by tightness in my chest are my only symptoms. I have had COPD and asthma for decades, and these bouts feel different to me.

Initial information was received on 16-APR-2021 from the patient, with additional information received on 20-APR-2021 from the patient.  The patient's weight was 170 pounds, and height was 65.5 inches. The most recent body mass index was 27.9. The patient's family history included rheumatoid arthritis in father, and concurrent conditions included arthritis (possibly rheumatoid arthritis), chronic back pain, and hip pain. The patient was due for a surgery, but it was cancelled due to pandemic. She had no history of headaches or migraines. Patient received several unspecified vaccines (had several vaccines 3 years ago before trip ) with no problems. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 on right arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg, daily, ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, metaxalone, oxycodone, and zinc. The patient concurrently receives spinal/epidural pain injections every two to three months.  Approximately 16-30 hours after the vaccination, she had a flare up of her arthritis (left hip, L3, L4, L5, sciatic pain on the left side going all the way down to her knee, ankle, and foot, where her normal arthritis hurts daily). Pain medication did not help. She also developed migraines which caused pain behind the left eye similar to severe sinus infection, light sensitivity, her face felt tingly and numb in her temples and cheeks (left side). She was concerned about a stroke, but did not have droopiness and could smile on both sides. On 29-MAR-2021 (day 14 post vaccination), the patient went to her pain specialist to receive her spinal/epidural pain injection because she was in a lot of pain and she was ""overdue"". In retrospect, the patient wondered if she should have waited longer after having received the vaccine before doing so. On 30-MAR-2021 (day 15 post vaccination), she awoke and was blind for several (12 - 14) hours. She thought she had a stroke and took 4 baby aspirins. She was rushed to the hospital and was hospitalized on 30-MAR-2021. After the initial 2-3 hours that she was completely blind, it would come back within minutes. The vision came back in halos. It was blurry but if she moved or bent down, it would go again and then it would come back very quickly. Several tests were performed. The MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) did not show clots, stroke, or tumors, but showed intracranial hypertension. After the CT and MRI, a lumbar puncture was performed (results not provided). The patient said that the hospital noted cerebral intracranial hypertension with free fluid in her brain behind her eye. In the hospital, bloodwork was normal except for her triglycerides which were high. Patient reported that her platelet levels which were ""perfect"" and provided ""318"" as a specific example. She was discharged on 01-APR-2021.  Corrective treatments included: steroids in the hospital for the intracranial hypertension and prescription strength aspirin 325 mg. The patient was not certain if injectable blood thinners were given to her in the hospital. She was discharged with methylprednisolone, alprazolam, twice a day prn to treat her headaches, aspirin 325 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 5 mg, daily, for high triglycerides. After patient was discharged, she had 2 episodes of lightheadedness with the blindness. The first one lasted about 5 minutes maximum and the second one on 12-APR-2021 lasted approximately  30-40 minutes. She had to be sitting down and her vision returned in halos with a lot of fireworks like bright stars. The patient had ringing in the ears, especially the left ear and when she had these episodes. On 14-APR-2021, the patient patient went to PCP (primary care provider). She stated that alprazolam helps her headaches. On 20-APR-2021, she had a ""good day"", did not experience headaches, and did not take alprazolam. She will follow up with a neurologist and an ophthalmologist.

The outcome of the cerebral intracranial hypertension with free fluid in brain behind eye and flared up arthritis were not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender's Comments: V0: This 52 year-old White female was hospitalized for intracranial hypertension 15 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.  Medical history includes an unspecified arthritis with chronic left hip and back pain for which she receives epidural injections every 2-3 months, and a body mass index of 27.9. She has no history of migraines or other headaches and has tolerated multiple vaccinations previously. Concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg daily, metaxalone, and oxycodone. Approximately 16 hours after vaccination, she experienced a flare of her arthritis which her pain medications did not relieve. The next day, she began to experience migraine headaches which were associated with pain behind her left eye and sinuses, left-sided facial tingling and numbness without weakness, and light sensitivity.  Fourteen days post-vaccination, she received an epidural injection because she was in a lot of pain. The following morning, she awoke and experienced visual disturbance, described as ""complete"" blindness. then return of vision with halos and blurriness, and intermittent loss and return of vision depending on her body position. She took 4 baby aspirins, went to the hospital, and was admitted. MRI showed intracranial hypertension but no clots, stroke, or tumors. A lumbar puncture and CT scan were also performed. Blood tests, including platelet counts (e.g. 318), were normal except for high triglycerides. She was treated with steroids and aspirin 325 mg and was discharged 2 days later. She was given methylprednisolone, oxycodone-acetaminophen and alprazolam prn for headaches, aspirin 325 mg, and rosuvatstatin for high triglycerides to continue at home and will follow up with a neurologist, ophthalmologist and her primary physician.

The hospital refused to believe me that i had some blood clot, they downplay the incident and instead gave me a brain CT SACN and brain  MRA which was negative, they kept me for observation overnight and let me go noon the next day.  since i have had follow ups with my regular doctor, a cardiologist and my nephrologist.  I know that reaction was due to medication, either way glad i got the shot.  BUT Since this time, I am retaining water, i know this because my rings do not fit anymore, rings i had for 20 years, never ever once had a hard time to put on or remove. I know my body, thats not the worse of it. i test my blood pressure every day at requesting of my kidney doctor,   since the incudent of my pressure 198/112 my diastolic on average is raised  20 points.  I log this daily.  here are some examples from before the medication  111/67 ,  109/63 ,   129/64 , 105/62 120/81.   now my pressure is totally different for example, 155/88  150/91  157/90 ,  134/88.  nothing else changed in my life, I am exactly the same as before only now i have covid shot..  yesterday i saw the 4th doctor since i am shot up and she gave me a new pill  olmesartan medoxomil,  only on it one day but my diastolic pressure is still much higher than before.  i dont want to die, i dont want a stroke, or a heart attach, i have a lot to live for still.  nobody is helping me, doctors are just throwing pills at me and not treating root cause which i feel strongly to beleive it is from covid shot.",,,Y,,Y,1,,,N,04/01/2021,04/11/2021,10,"04/01/21 ct scan mra all blood test you can imagive, i dont know how to  name them.",PUB,,"crestor, odefsey, norvasc, zebeta, bupropion,lamotrigine,cilostazol,plavix, imdur,",nonw,"HIV cardiovascular disease, triple, bypass heart. carotid endarectomary both side (forgive spelling)",,,2,04/22/2021,,Y,Y,no

A female patient of an unspecified age received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization; and lenvatinib mesilate (LENVIMA), via an unspecified route of administration from Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at 20 mg, 1x/day; via an unspecified route of administration from 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at 10 mg for endometrial cancer. Medical history included endometrial carcinoma, pleural effusion, and thoracentesis; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Keytruda infusions (drug therapy). It was reported that on 06Mar2021, the patient experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Oncologist was notified and advised the patient to stop Lenvima temporarily. The patient was also advised not to receive second COVID vaccine at this time. The patient was recently hospitalized for cough (unknown date of hospitalization or length of hospitalization). CXR (Chest X-ray) determined fluid buildup in lungs and thoracentesis completed. The patient had 650 ml of fluid removed. The patient resumed Lenvima and Keytruda infusions on 31Mar2021. The patient continued to experience hoarseness and elevation in blood pressure (unknown date of onset of symptoms). The patient is scheduled to repeat CT scans on 09Apr2021 and meet with oncologist next week to discuss results. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of cough and fluid buildup in lungs. The action taken in response to the events for lenvatinib mesilate was temporarily withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: Based on the information provided, there is no information to suggest a causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the reported events of cough and pleural effusion. This patients underlying malignancy with previous history of pleural effusion is assessed as a contributing factor. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

I used to have nose bleeds frequently when I was a young child but don?t really have them often anymore. After plugging it with a paper towel was not successful, I tried pinching my nose bridge and leaning forward which worked a little bit better but I could tell that the flow hadn?t stopped because the blood and the bloody mucus would collect in my throat and I had to spit it out. I applied a Vaseline like jelly balm in order to moisturize the skin in my nostrils. About maybe around half an hour after my nose bleed started the flow has abated and I am able to do my tasks without having to spit out the bloody clotted mucus that slides into my mouth and throat.

I went to the ER and they took a cat scan of my neck and reported back that everything looked normal - the nurse said it was most likely Cervical Radiculopathy. Then the following morning around 11 AM, I experienced very intense burning in my chest starting on the right side, eventually moving to the left encompassing my entire upper chest. I also experienced a very bad migraine, which I am typically used to but this one was more of a pressure headache between my temples that I felt in my ears and jaw. I made the decision to go back to the ER and to a different one this time. The ER failed to administer a Covid-19 test and to take bloodwork - both faults that family and friends in the medical field have pointed out to me. The doctor there had me receive an IV, a chest X-Ray, and an EKG. The X-Ray and EKG were both normal. The doctor had ordered a Covid-19 test but the nurse forgot to administer it before my discharge. In my IV I received Benadryl and Reglan along with typical IV fluids. I was also given Pepcid and Mylanta. At the end of my visit, the doctor concluded that he thought it was my acid reflux acting up - gastroenteritis. I went home and continued to experience chest burning, tightness, occasional numbness/pains in my body, and very, very bad headaches. On top of that, I could barely swallow - it felt as if my throat was closing. I took Pepcid and Tums and neither really did anything. After seeing a Cardiologist this same week, they ordered an Echocardiogram and routine bloodwork (metabolic panel).

About a week after,  I started feeling paresthesia, numbness in the right side of my body, specifically in the right leg and arm, and I started having difficulties walking.  Since the symptoms persisted, I went to the Dr. on March 23. I told him that I thought my symptom were out of the blue and I linked them to the vaccine, so I was visiting him to see if I should put my second vaccine in those circumstances, few days after. Doctor said that there was no relation between nerve damage and the vaccine and he recommended me to put it.  He sent me test thinking that could be multiple esclerosis. I did my brain MRI on Thursday 25 and on Friday March 26 I put my second dose.  About a week after the second dose my symptoms  were dramatically aggravated. I first started experiencing  a sudden fatigue that didn't even allow me to hold the cellphone or a spoon and I had to lie down. I couldn't hold my 8 months daughter because I felt such a strong weakness. This fatigue didn't allow me to work. This happened few days in a raw for few hours. On April 8th I started to feel needles and strong neuropathic pain that I had never experience in my whole life. On April 9th in the evening I had a massive crisis. I started to feel a sudden  having a lot of cold, starting shivering and then chattering teeth and strong headache. (Same reaction I had 12 hours after putting the second dose of the vaccine).  I had to lie down in bed and my husband had to cover me with a jumper and eiderdown, but I still was cold. I couldn't stop shivering. Then I had difficulty swallowing. And the worst part started when I felt all over my body an intense pins and needles, burning, electricity, very profoundly and spread all over in a very intense way., I thought I was dying. I started panicking, I didn't have control over my body. I had difficulty breathing and such a weakness that didn't make me speak because I couldn't stop chattering my teeth. Was the worst life experience ever until that moment. The situation lasted about 90 minutes and then went away. The next day, Sunday April 10th, I spent the whole day in bed to rest, but at night time I experienced the same crisis as the night before. It started with the sudden cold as well.  After that I didn't have more crises but the pins and needles pain remains and it made it difficult to sleep because of the pain and discomfort and I wonder if I would have it my entire life. I returned to the doctor. To a different one specialized in multiple esclerosis. Brain MRI came out negative but it was done one day before the second dose, so we cannot be sure. I did 3 MRI of my whole spine and some muscular tests to check the response of the nerves. They also took 8 tubes of blood.

TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging and 2-D reformatting performed from level of the thoracic inlet to the  kidneys after the uneventful administration of IV contrast. This exam was performed according to our departmental dose-optimization program, which includes automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction  technique. IV CONTRAST:  80 mL of Omnipaque 300 TOTAL DLP:  402.21 mGy-cm FINDINGS: There is suboptimal enhancement of the pulmonary artery. The central pulmonary artery  is patent. There is abrupt decreased contrast enhancement of the right greater than left lower  lobe segmental branches. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. The thyroid is normal. There is moderate atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is moderate atherosclerotic disease of the coronary arteries There is no pericardial effusion. Mediastinum and hila are negative for lymphadenopathy or mass.  There is a moderate hiatal hernia. The central airway is patent. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is mild to moderate degenerative change of the thoracic spine IMPRESSION: There is suboptimal enhancement of the pulmonary artery measuring Hounsfield units of the 162, normal enhancement is over 300 Hounsfield units this compromises evaluation of the segmental branches of the pulmonary artery especially the right lower lobe where there is decreased attenuation/lack of enhancement. This may be related to bolus timing however underlying pulmonary embolism cannot BE excluded.

INDICATION: Elevated d-dimer 1330. History of pulmonary emboli.   COMPARISON: PA and lateral chest x-ray 4/20/2021 and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis without  contrast 7/6/2017.   CTA CHEST FINDINGS: There is submaximal contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries  related to timing of imaging with regards to the phase of contrast, which may lower the  sensitivity and specificity in evaluation of pulmonary emboli, especially in the distal  subsegmental branches. Allowing for the limitations, no gross evidence of pulmonary emboli in  the adequately opacified pulmonary arteries. Main pulmonary artery measures 3.2 cm in diameter.   Aorta is age-appropriate without aneurysm. Direct origin of the left vertebral artery from the   aortic arch proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, a normal variant. Mild  atherosclerotic calcifications in the aortic arch and in the proximal left anterior descending  coronary artery. Heart size is normal with no pericardial effusion. No pathologic adenopathy is   seen in the chest. Nonspecific hypodense lesions in the included lower left lobe of thyroid  measuring up to 1 cm, with the thyroid incompletely included on this exam.   Minimal scarring in the lung apices. Minimal atelectasis or scarring in the anterior lingula or   possibly artifact due to volume averaging with pericardial fat pad. No acute infiltrate,  consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No suspicious pulmonary nodule is visualized.  Partially included upper abdominal organs are unremarkable. Stable chronic compression  deformity approximately T5 and T8 vertebral bodies since chest x-ray of 9/30/2019, with  suspected slight progression of compression fracture of T5 vertebral body since chest x-ray of  9/12/2018, with the compression deformity of T5 vertebral body new since CT chest exam of  7/6/2017. No acute osseous abnormality.   IMPRESSION:  1. Limited evaluation for pulmonary emboli due to submaximal contrast opacification of the  pulmonary arteries. Allowing for the limitations, no pulmonary emboli in the relatively  adequately opacified central pulmonary arteries with limited evaluation of the distal  subsegmental branches.  2. Nonspecific hypodense lesions in the partially included inferior left lobe of thyroid  measuring up to 1 cm, which appear new since 2017. Suggest thyroid ultrasound exam for further  evaluation.  3. Chronic compression deformities of T5 and T8 vertebral bodies, stable since at least  9/30/2019, with T5 compression fracture new since 7/6/2017.  4. Incidental direct origin of the left vertebral artery from the aortic arch, a developmental  variant. Coronary artery calcifications.   This CT exam was performed using one or more of the following dose reduction techniques:    automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size, and/or  use of iterative reconstruction technique.
