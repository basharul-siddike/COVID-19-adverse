See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccineï¿½ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21.

Day one of noticeable symptoms also included a slight fever at approximately 99.7 degrees, full body aches as if I'd been in a car accident, chills, a headache, shortness of breath and fatigue. The fever and chills and body aches had gone away after only two days but the shortness of breath and fatigue persisted at least 3 weeks or late December.  By January, I was slowly having my smell and taste back to normal. Early in February, around Feb. 4th, after my first vaccine and approximately 5 days before my second one, my smell and taste became horribly distorted. It started with mint and toothpaste. It started tasting/smelling like mold with pottery clay. After about 2 or three days, almost all foods began tasting and smelling like it was musty, moldy and rotten. Like dead fish or expired meat.  I first noticed with food but now it's other things as well. Cleaning agents like disinfectant wipes smell the exact same as a jar of peanut butter which is a strong, musty, moldy smell.

I received a metallic (Note I say metallic but I know it wasn't actually metal but that's simply the best way I can describe the taste I experienced) following the injection about 5 minutes after.  My arm remained sore following and still remains sore as of this report.  I experienced a decline in mental acuity following about an hour after injection.  I began to feel lightheaded and exhausted to the point I was experiencing severe disorientation and confusion.  I was having trouble putting sentences together and experienced a ringing sensation in the ears.  I felt like I wasn't even present anymore.  I couldn't comprehend things around me and apparently had conversations I don't even remember having.  Note that at that point I had gotten home but don't even remember getting home.  I just know that this did not begin to wear off until around 8:45pm  when it was like someone flipped a switch and I suddenly was coherent again.  It was an odd sensation to experience.  The arm remained sore and the metallic taste returned briefly after this experience.  I experienced a similar feeling from the HPV injection years ago, but just like this it was a temporary thing that resulted in no long term issues.  However, I cannot tell you fully what we did the rest of the day until around 845-9 pm.  I also remember becoming partly agitated after the injection like my body just all of a sudden took notice of something and shot into action.  I had received my allergy injections this same day about two hours earlier as well and none of these reactions ever occur with those for me.  I continued to drink liquid as far as I know as there were a few empty bottles of water next to me.  I have no recollection of getting them.  It's odd.  There's just this brief moment in time that is just missing from my memory with a few short bits and pieces that are there like a puzzle with some missing pieces.  I feel I became so fatigued I could not function.  My emotions I remember were off and hard to control during this period too.  I felt like I was having some random mood swings.  I feel ok now though aside from the upset stomach occasionally and the fatigue and arm pain (but even the arm pain has partly decreased now).  It all ceased.  I have a number of health issues outside of this but have not experienced this long of a period of almost intermittent amnesia and incoherency following an injection before.  I believe it made me that much more tired or reacted with one of my many conditions or genetic variants that perhaps may have been part of this.  I'm happy to provide anything I can to help with this.  I am greatly appreciative of all the CDC has done to get us this vaccine and continues to do to ensure our safety both before and after injection.  It is commendable.    I did fill out my survey through the V-Safe portal as well and will continue to follow up there should I have any changes.  I have not sought medical care following this event as the coherency and such have seemed to resolve in regards to the vaccine injection.  Only thing left are known side effects at this point besides an occasional increase in numbness and tingling that I already experience in my legs and feet.  My absolute best guess for the cause is my immune system which already has some issues regulating (doesn't always like to learn everything it should and we are currently searching for an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder currently going on as well in me) on top of allergy shots today.  it was perhaps just a bit too much demand on it all at once.  But it seems to be balancing out again now.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/19/2021,02/19/2021,0,I weigh about 137 lbs and am 5'8.

The ringing continued, and I sought out medical care from both Neurology and Otolaryngology.

I underwent oral steroid treatment as well as a series of 3, sequential weekly steroid injections into my middle ear space, though my tympanic membrane.   I also started taking oral L-Lysine at the recommendation of my neurologist as well as other herbals including oral flavonoids to help reduce tinnitus.

None of which has returned to date.  I have most recently just last week begun to a pursue hearing aid device at the recommendation of my ENT physician.

It was as if the left side of my body was in a different time zone than the right side.  I called the nurse line; they suggested a visit to the ER.  My BP was way up, and I panicked just a little; but, tried to use my mindfulness practice to observe the unfolding events, rather than being consumed by them.  There was a CT of my skull wherein they found indications of ""an old"" stroke; so, they decided that it was possible I had a stroke.  I was transferred from the Medical Center to the Stroke Center at the Medical Center under the care of Dr.  Another CT with contrast and a MRI confirmed ""OLD"" stroke, but nothing new.  I was assured the vaccine had nothing to do do with my symptoms, and that I most likely experienced a Trans Ischemic Attack (TIA), and that the situation was merely a coincidence as they believe the vaccine had nothing to do with the TIA.  However, based on my personal experience of the events as they unfolded, it is my sincere belief that the vaccine was incidental to the effects as I experienced them.  I was kept overnight for further observation, released the next day, and had a follow-up with my primary care physician at the Med Center.

After approximately 1 minute, the patient did regain consciousness. She was given orange juice and crackers and felt well enough to ambulate to a chair in the observation area.

Blood sugar checked reading 121. She was given more water but she was uninterested in any more food, as she questions if the orange juice and the crackers were the cause of the queasiness. Blood pressure was rechecked and she was again WNL. Given her persistent fatigue and ""queasiness"", team lead contacted ED charge nurse to discuss case. The recommendation was to have the patient further evaluated. Discussed with team lead, and it was agreed upon that this was best course of action given her persistent symptoms. EMS was called. Per EMS report, patient's blood pressure did rise which patient attributed to excitement/anxiety surrounding the situation. Patient ultimately declined EMS transfer to ED.

1043302,02/20/2021,TX,73.0,73,,M,,My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.,Y,02/11/2021,Y,,Y,1,,,N,02/05/2021,02/06/2021,1,,UNK,,,,Kidney failure - dialysis treatment 3x per week Recently recovered from stage 3 colon cancer,,,2,02/20/2021,,,Y,

Nor did a google search turn up any reports of dizziness or vertigo. Not moving my head helped some and I went to bed. Slept OK. Was very careful when getting up to use the toilet. By morning it was better, but still felt my equilibrium was a little off. I tried doing a test for positional vertigo to see if one ear might be the problem instead of a vaccination side effect and that was negative. By evening, I was back to normal. My biggest concern was that I was developing an inner ear problem as this was not a reported side effect. Then this morning I searched the CDC and found 96% of 302  Moderna adverse effects reported as of 2/12/2021 were for ""dizziness.""

Injection was easy, never felt it go in and no evidence on arm of a shot being given.  I was   symptom free for the entire two weeks.  2.- Feb.8,2021-  Received  my second Maderna shot.  When given it was like I had been punched. The one that inserted it was very rough and heavy handed.  I went to wait my time after receiving the shot.  It was only 10 minutes and I knew I was going to crash.  I had time to leave my chair, quickly told my husband, signaled a worker to come to me asked for a wheelchair so I wouldn?t fall and told the next gal what was happening and that I would not be able to talk, open my eyes or respond, but I would be aware of everything.  And so I responded exactly as before. The nurses and workers tried everything they had been trained to do. Smile they said, lift your arm, open your eyes.  They  were trying to figure out if I was having a stroke, a TIA, a heart attack.  One gal noticed my arthritic hands and suggested I was having  an arthritic attach. They asked me if they should get an ambulance. Of course they got nothing from me.  Finally they asked my husband if this was normal which he affirmed it was. They asked my permission to call an ambulance.   When hearing nothing, they asked my husband.  Of course he said yes but told them I would  come out of this.  By the time the ambulance walked into the room  my episode had basically  passed.. It was probably nearly an hour that had passed.  I could stand and greet them.  Naturally they took all of my vitals which showed everything normal.  I said I was happy to go home and that I could walk to the car but asked for them to walk with me for safety.  I got home and immediately went to bed and slept until  mid morning the next day when a Paramedic came to check on me.  3. The shot was given at 6:00 pm.  It was now about 10:00 the next morning  and I had a low fever.  During the next two weeks I am not aware of  my temperature  getting higher.  For the next 3 days I basically slept and had very little appetite.  I developed a rash on my left arm injection sight and on and around my upper torso.  It lasted 3 solid days.  I did not care for it in any way but tried to keep clothing away and make sure all was clean.  Next my mouth became ulcerated. My throat  was swollen,  the roof of my mouth was ulcerated and uncomfortable.  My tongue was heavily  coated and felt swollen.  I rinsed my mouth throughout the day  to help it heal. Then my normal dizziness  after eating increased and was continuous for many days.  Next was a silent migraine on my left side for two days. I did not feel comfortable to walk my normal 2 1/2 miles each day.  I had diarrhea for one day.  About Thursday of the second week I felt like things were coming back to normal.  8.  4. Feb. 19th I went to Clinic.  They found there were crystals  in the left ear and gave me a treatment.

She ate breakfast and hearty bean soup for lunch, but by 4:00 pm Thursday she became nauseous and was running a low fever around 99. We gave her a NyQuil dose which she quickly vomited. From there she continued to vomit and her temperature went up. When she needed to use the restroom, I escorted her, but by the time we reached that area she could not follow instructions to sit down and was holding onto the door jamb. She had soiled herself while standing there.  Eventually I was able to get her to sit down and was able to clean her up and change her clothes. But she could not follow instructions to stand up. With a second caregiver, we were able to get her to stand up, but within three steps of the toilet her knees buckled and she was unable to stand. We sat her in a walker with a seat and rechecked her temperature. It had gone up to 103. At this time, we considered calling 911, but instead we put a cool cloth on the back of her neck and monitored her (with three people all standing round). After a while we were able to move her back to the family room where she insisted upon sitting on the couch. She was able to stand up from the walker and move a few steps to the couch. By 10 pm she was starting to drift off to sleep sitting up and her temperature was back down around 99. When we were putting her to bed, she had no memory of where the clothes had come from or why she was not in her original outfit. Following that she slept and did not have another worrisome episode.

I had welts forming and hives appeared all over. As I pulled into my driveway( 7 min drive from vaccination site) I felt my lips and eyelids swell, and my throat felt tingly. I took another 2 chewable benadryls. (12.5mg each). I immediately called my Doctor and explained what was going on. I also started to wheeze. I used my inhaler.  He told me to use my epipen. Which I already had prepared since I knew this was anaphylaxis. I started to feel stable enough to go inside. I called my husband to come downstairs to be with me. I still wasnt feeling well and the tightness and wheezing persisted. At around  8:40, My dr. told me to use the 2nd Epipen and use my nebulaizer.

I could hardly get out of bed, I was so uncomfortable.   I looked at the Extra - Strength Tylenol, the Aleve and an anti-inflamatory - for which I would have had to take some food.  I decided to try one Aleve,  which I use only once in awhile for the Arthritis.  Hadn't used it in at least a month.  I sat and watched TV and within 35 minutes the fire and hurting had subsided.  That's the fastest Aleve has ever worked for me.  I went back to sleep and the next day felt like I was recovering from the flu - no energy.  I ate a little, watched a bit of TV and mostly slept the day away.  This is now the next day, Sunday, and I am back to normal.  I'm happy to not have had the bad headaches some report.

I decided to go through a drive through to get a bite to eat and something to drink.  While waiting in line, I could tell it was becoming more difficult to swallow.  Was hoping the drink would help.  I tried to take a bite of the chicken nugget, but about choked and had to spit it out.  I live approximately an hour from where the vaccination was administered and my goal was to just head home.  While driving on Road, I was talking with a friend.  I told my friend what I was experiencing in my throat area and that I needed to hang up to concentrate on what was going on.  I unbuckled my seat belt and pulled by coat and sweater out from throat area, wondering if they were compressing on it.  That did not help and I could tell something was just not right.  I was having a hard time swallowing.  I then googled possible side effects from the COVID vaccination and that is when I read about anaphylaxis reactions.  I was torn on what to do since by this time I was approximately 30 minutes from the testing site and just wanted to get closer to home.  There really were no medical facilities along my route home.  My friend called back to check on me.  Explained the situation and my friend suggested I stop at a gas station to get Benadryl.  I then drove to Town and took a 2 Benadryl tablets.  I also knew this town had a fire department and ambulance service in case things started to turn South.  I sat in my car for about 20 minutes to assess the situation.  I finally felt like I could make it the rest of the way home.  I had already put my family on notice in case things got worse.  By the time I made it to Town, my swallowing was less difficult.  My nurse friend recommended I continue to take Benadryl every 6 hours for 24 hours and then to take a Claritin.  That is what I did.  I did not report this to my PCP, but in hindsight... I probably should have.  It was quite alarming and truly a very scary feeling to experience this, especially while driving.

I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn't worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn't noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.",,,,,,,,,U,02/20/2021,02/20/2021,0,,SCH,,N/A.,N/A.,"Post Treatment Lyme Disease, chronic pain, asthma.",,,2,02/21/2021,,,Y,"Dairy, soy, all nuts (including peanuts & coconuts), aspirin,  navy beans, fluoroquinolines, mangoes, shellfish, mushrooms, bee venom, celery."

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn't sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn't think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn't know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn't seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: ""This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.""  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away.

She received this here at facility campus vaccine clinic.  She felt a strange tingling sensation immediately upon receiving the injection that extended from the injection site across her upper back but otherwise tolerated the injection well.  Because of her history of food allergy she was advised to remain at the vaccination clinic for 30 minutes.  During that 30-minute wait period she felt generally well however began to develop pruritus at her back in the legs.  She did not mention this to the staff at the vaccine clinic and did not look at her skin.  The pruritus was not too bothersome and she left the vaccine area after 30 minutes and walked down to our clinic to return to work.  Her pruritus intensified very quickly upon returning to her desk and within a few minutes of after her return she went into the bathroom to look at her back and had patches of red, raised, urticarial lesions across her back.  She began to feel itchy all over her body.  She remained at work and did not take any medication or seek any medical help.  She did not look at her legs.  The pruritus intensified and when she looked at her skin of her legs approximately 1 or 2 hours later she had developed urticaria essentially head to toe.  She had large confluent patches of urticaria at bilateral thighs, urticaria at her face, trunk, arms, legs.   At this point she felt otherwise well.  She went home and took 10 mg of Claritin and applied a topical Benadryl cream to her skin.  This was not helpful.  She had severe pruritus of her eyes and eyelids.  She took 50 mg of oral Benadryl which also was not particularly helpful.  Sometime in the middle of the night that night she developed chills, felt feverish, and developed intense muscle and joint aches.  She took an unknown dose of ibuprofen with minimal improvement in muscle and joint pain.  She did have improvement in fever.  Following day was Saturday, she spent the whole day in bed in extreme pain.  She describes the pain at her wrists as feeling as though ""somebody was breaking my bones"" with any movement of her wrists.  She had pain even laying flat in her bed and had severe pain at all of her joints with movement.  She tried taking a flexeril with no improvement. She recalls a T-max of 102 sometime on Saturday or Sunday.  At that time she had been taking ibuprofen around-the-clock.  She also took 10 mg of Claritin approximately every 4 hours.  Each night she also took 50 mg of Benadryl.  She continued to experience urticarial skin rash and intense pruritus of the skin.  The urticaria waxed and waned during this time.  She also developed a fever blister at her lower lip. She spent most of Sunday in bed also.  She was feeling a bit better by Monday however still had intense pruritus.  Skin rash was much improved at most of her body however she still had mild urticaria at her face.  She did not have a fever on Monday but was continuing to take ibuprofen around-the-clock.  She discontinued ibuprofen yesterday and has not had fevers or chills since Sunday.  At this point her urticaria has essentially resolved. She continues taking claritin 10mg BID to 3 times a day and also 50mg bendaryl at bedtime.    She did not experience any bruising related to this rash however did have excoriation from scratching particularly at her face.   Throughout the course of these days she did not have any episodes of angioedema of the lips, tongue.  She denies difficulty breathing, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, throat tightening, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope.   She has a history of oral allergy syndrome with peanut.  Promethazine has caused diplopia, weakness.  Simvastatin caused muscle weakness.  She has never had any issues with vaccines.

So it got rescheduled to Thursday 2/18 at 12p.   My 1st dose was Moderna. I gave the lady my card and a Moderna sticker is clearly on it and readable. She came back to my vehicle and gave my 2nd injection; apparently she gave me Pfizer (I didn?t know that until she handed my card back to me). She handed my card back; I looked down at it and saw it said Pfizer. I said, ?What just happened? I got Moderna the 1st time why does my 2nd one say Pfizer?? She didn?t have anything to say. She then left immediately to go get someone else to talk to me. This person said I wasn?t the 1st person this has happened to. It still has the same mRNA molecules in both vaccines. She also said I shouldn?t need another dose of any vaccine. I should be okay even though I got the different vaccine. I was also told by her that when the sites run out of Moderna or Pfizer; then they are giving (employees and the public) the opposite one that they have on hand. (I don?t know how true this is but this is what I was told).    After this happened I contacted my Director and my Manager and informed them of what happened. They both said I did nothing wrong Director contacted our Employee Health office. Then the Employee Health Nurse called me to check on me and get some information.    Nurse called me again on Friday to see how I was and to take more information to fill out an incident report. Then she was going to talk to the Head Pharmacist again and get back to me about what he said. I haven?t heard back from her yet.    I?m still upset because that incident should never have happened (and it?s bad that it happened to an employee). Our employees need to slow down. They need to make sure their name badge is visible (the lady giving mine- I never saw her badge). Then they need to verify what vaccine they have in their hand with the pt/person again before they inject it to avoid another situation from occurring like mine).    What I?m more upset about is: there is no research as far as what having 1 dose of Moderna and 1 dose of Pfizer is going to do to my body?? Am I protected at all? Am I more protected? Will I have bad side effects later? We don?t know. That?s the scary part.   I just don?t want this to happen to another employee or anyone else.   So far the only thing I had happen to me since the injection is a painful sore left arm.

Nausea started shortly afterwards. The joint pain was excruciating and it was very difficult to move. By 0330, I started vomiting. Vomiting continued until approximately 0745. I felt dehydrated but was not able to hold down any water. I contacted the Nurse Advice line and spoke to a nurse. She asked me a series of questions, all relating to signs indicative of an allergic reaction. I knew I was not experiencing a typical allergic reaction. But I was experiencing a bad reaction. Based on my responses to her questions, she did not recommend that I go an Urgent Care Clinic or see a Doctor. The severe joint pain continued through 02/14/2021. I started to feel better on 02/15/2021. Even though I did not experience an allergic reaction, given the severity of my joint pain and vomiting, I still feel it is important for what I did experience to be documented.

About 4:00 pm that same afternoon I started to feel some soreness around the injection area and a slight headache. 2. By about 7:00 pm that same evening the soreness and headache had increased and I was feeling general body achiness. It was much worse sitting or standing so I ate a small dinner and then went to bed to lie down. I felt much better to be prone. 3. I normally go to sleep between 11 pm to 1 am but fell asleep around 8:20 pm. When I go to sleep that early I often wake up during the night and will be awake for a few hours before falling asleep again. That is what happened. I slept about 3.5 to 4 hours then was up for about 3 hours then went to sleep again for about 3 to 4 hours. I think I got about 7 hours sleep which was good since my typical is about 6 hours. 4. I woke up the morning of one day after and still felt the same, that is, my arm was very sore, and somewhat swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness, and it was worse sitting and standing and much better lying down prone. Other than getting something to eat I stayed prone most of the day until later afternoon when I did manage to be sitting up for several hours. 5. By the time I went to sleep that night, again a little earlier than normal but maybe around 10 pm, my arm was very sore, and pretty swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness. 6. By the time I awoke on the morning two days after the vaccination, that is 2/20/21, everything was reduced but still there, that is, my arm was still sore and swollen but much less from the peak, and I had a mild headache and the body aches were pretty much gone. 7.

I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn't needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused.

If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx'd with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a ""real rough night last night"", didn't sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn't heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.

Migratory polyarthritis He appears to have some form of a migratory arthritis or more of a tendinitis.  It has moved too fast to be a true inflammatory arthritis.  I wonder if this could be a reaction to the Covid vaccine that he received 2 weeks ago.  I suggested that he continue the prednisone as it might be helpful.  I will try to get a sedimentation rate and CBC today.  I suggested taking some low-dose aspirin for a few days just in case there might be some microscopic clot formation.","?
