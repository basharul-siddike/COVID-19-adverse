Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.",,,,,,,,,N,01/13/2021,01/14/2021,1,"1/18/21 - TSH 0.027; FT4 3.20 1/21/21 - TSH 0.014; FT4 4.85; T3 12.1; anti-TPO 17; alk ph 135; ALT 54; ESR 79; CRP 46; TSI < 10  Echocardiogram 1/27/21: Normal LV size and systolic function; Normal RV size and function; no significant valvular abnormalities, no pericardial effusion  Radioactive iodine thyroid uptake scan: Markedly decreased 24 hour radioiodine uptake, consistent with Hashimoto's or other types of thyroiditis.

1005572,02/05/2021,NJ,21.0,21,,F,,"About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn't changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms.

1006210,02/05/2021,TX,27.0,27,,F,,"The Moderna vaccine administration was painful at the time the shot was received. I experienced symptoms of fatigue and body aches for 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. My left arm was extremely sore and knotted for over a week after administration. The vaccine site was red and splotchy for the first 7 days after getting the shot. By the early morning of the 8th day (01/16/21), the splotches had joined together to make a large red area surrounding the vaccine site, that was raised and hot to the touch. During that entire day, pain was shooting down my left arm to my fingers (particularly the left middle finger) in a manner that felt like how severe arthritis pain is described. The pain became worse as the day went on. I texted a picture of my arm to my boss, who is a physician, to see what he thought I should do. He stated that from the photo, it looked like Cellulitis, and offered to send in an antibiotic to my pharmacy. Soon after, the pain was so intense (especially with movement of the arm) that I had someone drive me to  ER & Urgent Care around 8:30pm. The physician there marked my arm and prescribed 2 antibiotics to begin taking immediately (Bactrim & Amoxicillin) with the instructions to come back in 48 hours. By the next day, the redness was spreading by the hour, which was marked & tracked via photos that documented the progression. By Monday morning, the redness had continued to spread & take up most of my left upper arm. The skin was hot to the touch and swollen. I had my boss look at my arm in the morning and mark the redness, then I had another physician at my office look at it in the afternoon and do the same. Their analysis was that the antibiotics were not working, and I went back to  ER after I got off work at 5pm, which was around the 48-hour mark when I was supposed to return.  ER gave me several IV antibiotics and ordered an Ultrasound of the left arm to make sure there was no blood clot hidden beneath the swelling.  They also took several different lab and blood culture samples. I ended up having a reaction to one of the IV antibiotics (Vancomycin), where they had to counteract the reaction with IV steroids & antihistamines, and decided to hold off on giving me the third IV antibiotic that was initially planned. I was sent home with Clindamycin 900mg, a Medrol dosepack, and told to discontinue the Bactrim, but continue the Amoxicillin. I continued to check back over the following days, and ended up receiving another IV antibiotic (Clindamycin) and more lab tests. The provider that saw me on Monday said that she was close to admitting me to the hospital, and if I did not improve by the following day, she would proceed with sending me.

Around January 6-7th, when I got the second dose, the rash began to spread down my sides. That area was more itchy than my neck. The rash appearance was very consistent, as was the distribution with what I have seen of pityriasis rosea in my patients where you start with a Herald patch somewhere and then the rash spreads to other parts of the body. In January I had sought out an appointment through a virtual healthcare. they were hesitant to start steroids so as not to interfere with my immune response.

While the Benadryl infusion was going on patient reported feeling lightheaded and her heart rate was noted to increase to the 130s briefly.

She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some ""pressure in her head"" and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile.

Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn't hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn't want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.)

That kept going for a few days. On 30th, I found out I was exposed to someone that had COVID. 30th was tested and results on 31st - positive. I went to URGENT Care to get the test. Albuterol inhaler was prescribed; and an Antibiotic for my symptoms. She told me not to start the medication until I found out that I was positive or not. So I started the meds on the 31st. I got sicker before I got better - got chills and sweating (back and forth); felt really tired and out of energy and had  brain fog and I tripped on things in front of me. I didn't have any appetite. Had to force myself to eat so I could take my medicine - for about a week. I was coughing a lot. Took over the counter cough medicine especially night because it was disturbing my sleep.

Worked a 7L shift on 1/24 and at about 2000 noticed a petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities that spread up to lower abdomen. Called on-call L&D Doctor and she advised for me to be assessed at L&D triage. I was then admitted for 4 hours due to my rash and further workup concerning for DIC, thrombocytopenia and/or other possibilities. My petechial rash was very concerning for coagulation disorders and prompted many lab draws to be obtained. My labs showed elevated AST & ALT that were previously normal, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), protein in urine, elevated alk phos. I was discharged around 0100 for further workup the following day.  On 1/25 I went to clinic to have more labs done per Doctor. 1/26 at about 0830 I was called by my OB Docotor to immediately go back to Labor & Delivery triage to be admitted for what she thought was preeclampsia based on my labs from 1/25 and 1/24. I was again admitted for about 4 hours for monitoring of baby, and myself for preeclampsia. My labs were still elevated and out of range mirroring preeclampsia, but my blood pressure was stable, so I was discharged around 1300. I followed up with labs at clinic on 1/28 and again on 2/2 as well as with home blood pressure monitoring.  My labs on 2/2 showed everything back to normal, causing the doctors involved in my care to believe this was an adverse event due to the moderna covid vaccine.

It?s been getting a little worse every day, including today (Friday). I?ve been regularly putting petroleum jelly on my right, lower lip to relieve the discomfort. I?ve also been putting petroleum jelly all over my lower and upper lips, because both lips have become unusually dry since the swelling began.  2A) Part of my skin (near the needle?s point of entry on my arm) came off when I removed band-aid at end of my shower on Tuesday (Feb2) morning.  The narrow, skin-missing area on my arm is a little less than the size in length of the width of the band-aid that I removed. (I have a photo if you?d like to see it.) Although I turned shower water off before removing the band-aid, that raw skinless part of my arm started to sting and burn profusely, immediately after I removed band-aid. The steam (not water) from the shower stall is what burned so badly. When looking in mirror to investigate source of pain, I was puzzled as to why my skin was missing.   2B)Wednesday (Feb3) morning, my husband attempted to put Neosporin on that small portion of my skinless arm to prevent infection from setting in. But it was so painful, I had to stop him. The area burned for more than an hour. So now I keep the band-aid on that spot and don?t remove it. It?s still very sensitive, and I feel discomfort while taking a shower. But since I leave band-aid on, it doesn?t burn and sting like before. And It wasn?t until Thursday (Feb4), after looking online at missing skin, that I realized that my skin apparently came off when I removed the bandage. I also read, when looking online, that skin removal with bandages can happen more often with older folks like myself.

I became panicked, and had a panic attack. I pulled off the road, and dealt with my panic symptoms which were  typical for me when I have panic attacks (sense of doom, extreme fear that I am dying, depersonalization).  I forgot that it was triggered by itching.  In fact, I did not report a reaction to the vaccine center when I got my 2nd shot because I considered it a panic attack, which is not new, and I had forgotten about the itching.  I  remembered this happened when I received the 2nd shot on 2/2/21 at 2:00 and remained at the center for 30 min (due to my sulfa allergy).  Again driving home (abt 45 min  after the vaccine) my face became itchy and hot.  It lasted approximately 20 min, and resolved.  No other acute symptoms .

1007398,02/06/2021,NY,24.0,24,,F,,"On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.",,,,,,,,,N,01/21/2021,01/28/2021,7,,PUB,,"Hydroxizine, Seroquil, Doxazosin, Levothyroxine, Omeprozol, Larissia, Effexor, Lamictal",,,,,2,02/06/2021,,Y,Y,Penicillin Abilify

I hung around for a little while and left. I know it was a allergy but honestly considered going back for the second dose of that is how it could be handled again.

About 3 hours later the swelling had gone down enough for me to eat some and talk better. By the next day things were much better.

1007661,02/06/2021,FL,43.0,43,,F,,"The first shot I received on December 28th.  I have fatigue and a headache for about three days and my arm did hurt for close to 2 1/2 weeks,  the second week it was red, 3 inches in diameter, raised, also it itched very badly for 4-5 days.                I received the second maderna vaccine on 1/28/21 about 5:45 pm. I had noted about 8 pm mild burning to the lower part of my legs and bottom of my feet that evening.  Later I started to have mild nausea about 9 pm, but it resolved, and I went to bed.  I woke up about 3:11 with diarrhea and my body and mainly ""my skin"" started to hurt, as if someone was taking a wire brush to my legs, and slowly pulling out each hair, but at one time. After another hour or so, I started to have severe chills with increased nausea and more severe severe body/bone/joint pains. I took Tylenol at this time. I noted that the bottom of my ribs or rib cage hurt with breathing, also I had upper abdominal pain, severe lower back pain and a headache. The next morning I stayed in bed all day and took a few baths, I had multiple episodes of diarrhea. I was nauseated, but no vomiting.  I still had chills, bodily shaking, fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  I tried to sleep off and on through the day.  That evening I did have a temperature of 101.4 with using Tylenol and Motrin.  It did come down later that evening, but I still had severe pain of my body and my skin hurt, even the hair on my head, during the night about 2:45 am I took a bath and that did help with my body.  on Saturday evening I was able to start getting up and moving around, but a severe decreased appetite. I've noted a drastic change in taste since having the vaccine and have lost 9 lbs in the past week.  I am able to taste, but everything has a different taste.  I have had two covid tests PCR's in order to return to work.  I also have had the continued bilateral leg burning from the calves to the bottom of my feet.  The sensation is if you are cold outside and come back in and run your hands or feet under warm water to warm them up and that pain you feel when they warm up is how they feel, but on a milder level than that pain.  I also have had post nasal drip that has started in past 5 days and while at work in the ER on Tuesday I had a PA look at my ears and I had a large amount of fluid behind both ears.  I had a zpack that I had at the pharmacy that I had refilled and have taken that for the past four days with some relief.  I still feel fluid in my ears, but mildly better.  The headache and fatigue is getting better each day.  My appetite is still very diminished as well as how things taste in my mouth, it is way different than anything I have ever experienced before.  I also had an Issue on Monday 2/1/21 when I was working, I felt in my brain, as if it was just not as sharp, cloudy. I had an issue with typing on my right hand for a few hours (upper row on rt side) that has since resolved, but it was a truly ""off"" day.  It has taken me this entire week to start to feel even a bit more back to human.  So what remains- the bilateral leg to bottom of feet weird burning sensation, decreased appetite,  taste alterations, post nasal congestion with bilateral fluid in ears, shortness of breath with activity, mild burning in lungs with activity (working out/running in the cold weather).           this was just a side note that was copied to the bottom.       I was unable to touch my arm right arm due to swelling and pain for about three day, which I know is to be expected and actually wasn't as sore as long as the first shot.  I did take a few doses of Motrin 800mg but tried to stay with Tylenol and Zofran, and hydrate.              I noted that warm baths helped the most and the use of a heating pad on my lower back and an ice pack on and off my head for the headaches.

I also started feeling dizzy and , ultimately, fainted, which put me in the emergency room, where they ruled out a PE and all cardiac emergencies. My blood pressure spiked with a systolic around 165 (my usual is 90-95). Labs indicated everything was fine. The only thing different than usual was the vaccine.

This lasted for about 2 days, managed well by alternating Motrin and Tylenol. A mild rash occurred a few days after shot #2.   Thought I was done since most of my colleagues bounced back after 2-3 days. Then 48 hours in, I developed a racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools. No position or relaxation method would resolve these symptoms. All I could do was lie down perfectly still with an ice pack on my forehead and hope this was short-lived and would pass. I could not sleep. I had no appetite. Over the 8 days this has been occurring, I lost 3 pounds.  I could not find any literature of anyone else having any cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. It scared me. I have no prior cardiac history and no history of anxiety. I went to the ER. Labwork showed an elevated D-dimer (luckily the CT scan showed NO blood clots), elevated WBC/neutrophils, and low potassium. Thyroid labs (which I had tested a few days later) were normal. The ER assumed the abnormal labs were due to the immune response to the vaccine and referred me to a cardiologist.   I did a virtual visit with the cardiologist the next day. He suggested a heart monitor and scheduling an echo. The heart monitor was mailed to me. I started wearing it on 2/4/21 (3 days ago). I am supposed to wear it for 7 days and then mail it back. My echo is scheduled for 3/4/21. Again, I have had no previous cardiac history. I am an active, healthy 38 y/o F.   These symptoms (racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools) have continued to last for another 8 days and are debilitating. I have not been able to work.   On day 7 of these symptoms, I called my PCP?s emergency line. They suggested calling the cardiologist to see if they would consider prescribing a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. I called the cardiologist last night. They prescribed Metoprolol. I haven?t taken it yet. It?s officially day 8. I thought I was in the clear and had not had symptoms since last night, but then just now another episode of these cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms have occurred but less intense than previously.   At this point, I have had had 10 days of symptoms post Moderna vaccine #2 but 8 of those days are specifally the cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. Although a little better, these symptoms have NOT resolved and continue.  I realize I am probably an outlier in terms of how I have reacted to this vaccine. I would love a call back to know if other people have had a similar experience, so I can understand if this is ?normal.? I understand 7% of patients in the Moderna vaccine trial had ?symptoms? lasting longer than 7 days. Were they symptoms similar to mine? Will this go away completely? Any help is appreciated.   Of note, I did develop a nice rash below my injection site on Moderna shot #1. Does that mean I?m more ?reactogenic? and would potentially have a harder time with shot #2?
