I started feeling pain on my left arm, spreading to my left upper chest and shoulder, spreading to my head on the left side. I went to bed. Woke at about 4:00 am by pain. By then the pain was pervasive, hurting me from head to toe, on both sides. My stomach had sharp waves of pain, eventually my upper right abdomen was likewise in pain. I thought it was my small intestines but it could have been other organs in there such as liver and kidney. I have never felt pain in that area like that before. I got up to pee and drink water. It was painful to move. My right lower back was in sharp pain as I moved. My leg muscles and tendons had sharp pain when I walked. I got back in bed. Lying down eased the pain some. By morning the pain was less severe. I got up again and it was still painful to walk. My leg muscles hurt and my ankles hurt. I ate a yam with some plain nonfat yogurt. The pain became worse all over. I got back in bed. The pain eased a little, but did not ease as much as earlier in the morning. Eventually the pain moved down to my uterus, then by noon it moved to my inner thighs. By 1:00 pm it was in my knees as well. There?s still pain everywhere but the more severe pain was moving down to my lower body. The pain was disabling. I feel it more when I got out of bed. It?s aching pain mixed with sharp pain, like pulling a muscle kind of sharp. I?m afraid to eat because it seems like the pain got worse after I ate. Had a glass of milk at 4:00 pm and it made me feel worse. Did not eat or take my supplements the night of 2/3/2021. Cleaned up the kitchen despite the pain because I had to. Lied on the couch and fell asleep. Woke at 9:30 pm and went to bed. Still achy all over but pain less severe. Pain in knees and below continued. Woke 6:30 am 2/4/2021. Pain was much less severe when I woke. Went downstairs to take my thyroid meds and felt sharp pain on my left leg mostly calf and ankle as I walked down the stairs. Went back to bed and pain came up to my left thigh and groin. Becoming more and more pronounced in my left groin. It?s sharper and higher up and closer to my uterus. By 7:30 am the pain was up to my left armpit. My left leg was feeling a little numb. On the whole the aches are less pronounced and the traveling sharp pain less frequent. Staying in bed was still the best way to deal with the pain. I started feeling hungry but it?s only been an hour and a half since I took my meds. Waited two hours to have plain nonfat yogurt with banana and pears. Felt okay afterwards. Was able to do a zoom session. Had a large bowel movement. Felt okay. There?s still lingering pain on left side, but less severe. The milder pain lasted through the rest of the day. By afternoon there?s sharp pain in right labia minora. Felt like an open sore. Pain was intermittent. Was able to prepare and eat light dinner. Fell asleep on the couch. Woke at about 11:00 pm with strong frozen muscle pain digestive on left side. Sat up and drank 2 large mugs of warm water slowly. Pain finally passed two hours later. Labia minora intermittent sharp pain continued. Examined area with hand mirror but found no open sore. Found nothing. Washed area with hand held shower. Felt no open sore when examined by hand. No sharp pain felt in area upon touching and washing. Skin felt smooth and intact with no break. After washing the sharp pain was gone. Went to bed and it?s only slight pain on left calf and ankle now. Slept till 7:00 am. 2/5/2021. Fairly pain free except upper left arm of shot area still sore. All day fairly pain free. At bedtime a splitting pressure headache on left side developed and became more and more severe. Pain was sharp. Lasted about an hour. The sharpness faded but felt the remnants of lingering pain for longer. Slept till 7:00 am. All day fairly pain free. Headache and leg shoulder blade pain at bedtime.

I found this odd, but didn't notice any swelling or difficulty breathing.  At 5:02 I texted my husband to make sure my Epipen was in the glove compartment in case I needed it later after leaving the vaccination clinic.

I noticed my heart beating faster and wondered if my body was subconsciously anxious about the numb feeling even though I didn't feel worried because I was breathing fine.  Very suddenly my heart started to pound very hard, my entire laryngopharynx went numb and I felt like a deck of cards was sitting in the back of my throat.  I looked at the clock, it was 5:07.  I started to feel dizzy and weak, my heart felt like it was about to explode, my hands were suddenly cold, clammy and shaking, I started to get sharp stomach pains similar to other anaphylactic events, but still no effects on my breathing. I looked at the clock, 5:09, I knew I had to tell someone before I couldn't get up to walk.  As I started to talk to a staff member I felt very disoriented and suddenly went from feeling like I was going to faint to very hypertensive with pain shooting into my left arm.  The staff quickly tooth my BP and HR, I noted my BP was 166/100 (I am normally 114/72) and the doctor stated I was too tachycardic and needed to go to the ER.  At the ER I received Benadryl, Pepcid and an IV, but never needed any epinephrine.  The medications resolved numbness and stomach pain.  I left with the feeling of a tight turtleneck around my throat and it continues to come and go.  Every 6-8 hours I have had to take Benadry and a steroid to keep the intense itching numb feeling in my soft palate away.

I went for my chest X-ray and then went straight to the ED. I was hypertensive and tachycardic when I arrived. My blood work and imaging were all normal.  2/12 - I saw a cardiologist who put me on a beta-blocker to temporarily control my symptoms. He believes I am having a secondary reaction to the vaccines as opposed to a primary issue with the heart. I am scheduled for an echo on 2/15 to cover all bases.  Symptoms have NOT subsided to date - I am still short of breath, have chest pressure, palpitations and tachycardia are being controlled with a beta-blocker (resting HR is 60s but will jump to high 90s with any movement), blood pressure being controlled with beta-blocker.   **I was evaluated for palpitations in 2018 but they were found to be minor and no specific cause was to be found, nor was the cardiologist concerned at the time.

She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5's and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.

It was probably about 3.5 inches in length 2 inches in width. The patient stated that it did not necessarily have a shape. She had a large bruise on her right buttock. Two days later, she noticed a similar in size bruise on the front of her right thigh. Then a couple days later, she noticed three quarter size bruises on her right arm (two on the inner part of arm, and one on the outer, both on upper arm). The very next day, she developed the same sizing bruise. It was about the same size on her left upper arm. There were no other side effects besides the bruising. There was no itching or redness, no skin, respiratory, or neurological issues. The day before her second dose, on 26Jan2021, she noticed a 4 inch reddened area with a two centimeter nodule inside that bruise. The patient stated that the initial bruises began to heal. They are not as dark as they were. They were reported to have started out red and then turned black and blue. The patient also had numbness and tingling in her right thumb. She was having some chest discomfort after the initial vaccination that is still ongoing.

On the third day I woke up at noon and noticed that the right side of my lower cheek just above the jawline was markedly swollen, as well as half of my lower lip. There was no pain; the skin felt a bit numb, but it did itch at times, though not very intensely.  During the night of the third day, my full bottom lip swelled, and cracked open and oozed a clear liquid the thickness of water, though not a lot of it.  The whole lip looked as if it were a water balloon encased in a thin layer of skin.  Also this day I had a mild sore throat, but no other symptoms.   On the fourth day when I awoke, the swelling was all across the lower portion of my face, but was notably worse on the left side.  It looked like a golf ball was in my cheek.  Also the left side of my lips were so swollen I couldn't close my teeth.   In the afternoon, as I was eating biscuits my upper lip swelled enormously.   At this point it was hard to drink liquids as I couldn't make a seal as my lower lip was swollen unevenly. On the fifth day (today) I awoke with my upper lip extremely swollen.  My lower cheeks were still swollen, but not grotesquely so.  I had a tepid cup of coffee and when I finished my upper lip was no longer swollen!  My cheeks remain mildly swollen.  I didn't go into work today as the upper lip was so horrid, I couldn't be seen, but I will return to work tomorrow.

She was given Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and Pepcid IV and was given a dose of an Epi-pen.  She took Benadryl for 3 days.  She finished a round of 60mg daily prednisone (for 5 days) yesterday.  She felt jittery on the prednisone and this has persisted but is improving. She continues to have a feeling of chest pressure.  First dose Moderna 025J20A 1/8/21; second dose Moderna 031L20A 2/5/21.  She continues to note some mild swelling of her tongue but is otherwise improved.  She does continue to have some pressure type pain in her chest which is also somewhat improved and more diffuse in nature.  A/P: She is okay to taper off of her Benadryl.  She has an EpiPen should she need it, though I do not anticipate this being necessary.  She should note continued improvement in her symptoms to include the mild swelling that is persistent in her tongue.",,,,,,,,,Y,02/05/2021,02/05/2021,0,None,PVT,,Fluticasone nasal spray PRN,Chest pain and lip tingling after 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/8/21.,Mild anxiety,PCP Visit 1/14/2021 at 16:22: S/O: Patient got the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Friday 1/8/21 for the first time (age 36).

She was healthy, did not have recent varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection or exposure to herpes zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, chickenpox or shingles. No known drug allergies (NKDA). The patient did not receive any concomitant therapies. On 19-DEC-2020, the patient delivered a female baby with no congenital anomalies. Approximately last menstrual period (LMP) was on 14-MAR-2020 and the date of conception was established as approximately 28-MAR-2020.  On 20-DEC-2020, the patient was vaccinated with varicella virus vaccine live (oka/merck)(VARIVAX) 0.5 ml, in right arm, lot # T020652, upon internal validation was determined to be a valid lot #, expiration date was not reported but established as 16-JUN-2022 (strength and route of administration were not reported) since it was determined during a prenatal screen, that she was not immune to varicella (for prophylaxis). The physician was not sure, if the baby was in close contact or in the room at the time the patient was vaccinated. No rash occurred at the site of injection following the vaccination.  On approximately 09-JAN-2021- 11-JAN-2021, also reported as day 21-23 post-vaccination, the patient (mother) developed a rash (vesicles) to face, hands and abdomen, less than 10 lesions (also reported as less than 50). The rash was also described as erythematous papules, no vesicles (inconsistency). She was afebrile. The baby was breastfeeding at the time the patient had developed a rash, and was switched to formula on an unknown date in January 2021 (reported also as shortly thereafter) (maternal exposure during breast feeding).  It was not specified if the patient was breast feeding before rash. The physician wanted to send viral isolates. Since 11-JAN-2021, the patient had no new lesions (dried up). She did not receive any treatment. On 20-JAN-2021, the sample scab from the patient's abdomen was collected.  The patient was enrolled in the Varicella Zoster Virus Identification Program to identify if VZV was present and if it was present, to identify if it was associated with the wild-type (WT) VZV strain or with the Oka/Merck vaccine strain.  On 19-JAN-2021, the call was made to physician to confirm receiving requested program information. The physician was not sure, if they would send samples to disease control or another lab or if would participate in the Varicella Zoster Virus Identification Program (VZVIP), since the physician would need to discuss further with the manager. The program information was e-mailed to the physician as requested. The physician had additional questions upon receipt of the program information and an additional phone call was made. Upon speaking with the physician during the second call, the reporter stated, that they would like to send samples through the VZVIP. Detailed shipping instructions were provided.  On 20-JAN-2021, a call was made to the physician to help arrange for the shipping of samples. On that day, the specimen sample was collected from the patient's right foot vesicle/lesion. The physician confirmed, that there would be four total samples sent: 3 samples from the baby and 1 lesion scab from the mother's (patient's) abdomen. The call concluded with discussion that all four samples would be picked up by the courier by the end of business.  On 25-JAN-2021 it was confirmed by the physician, that the 3 patient's specimens were sent to the laboratory on 20-JAN-2021. The samples were delivered. The results were still not obtained. Additional information has been requested.

On 01-FEB-2021, the PCR results were reviewed with the patient's physician who confirmed that.  Telephone call on 04-FEB-2021 was made to provide results of the report received from the physician for the PCR analyses processed through the VZVlP for both the patient and the baby.

I didn't think this vaccine would be similar.  I am not someone who gets very sick often and I don't miss days of teaching for illness. Note that my first vaccine on 1/21 had no effects.  I did not even get a sore arm.  I even sort of bragged about it. The 2nd vaccine on 2/11 seemed fine until I woke up the following morning feeling like I had been hit by a truck.  I yawned for 3 hours straight, but still made it to school and worked and taught 6 online classes.  I took an ibuprofen that morning because I was feeling so odd.  By 3:00 I was driving home (40 minute drive) and I cried uncontrollably the whole way home while my hands and feet were shaking.  Not normal for me. When home I went almost immediately to bed.  I had a slight temperature and was dizzy. I thought I had the chills but it didn't feel like any chills I have had before.  Usually my teeth would chatter and I would feel hot and cold at the same time. The hottest temperature I had was 100.5.  But by 9 I started shaking so profusely that I couldn't pick up the thermometer any more, I couldn't use my phone, or take a sip of water.  I stumbled to the bathroom holding onto things all the way.  My husband was not home, or I imagine he would have called 911 at that point.  I kept shaking a lot through the night and kept praying that it wouldn't happen to my heart.  I fell asleep eventually and dreamed of fish flopping inside me and my neighbors coming over to to see why the bed was knocking against the wall.   Saturday morning I woke up and all the shaking had stopped, but I found I was too weak to get up much.

These chills alternated with sweats - waking up frequently either with chills or sweats. These symptoms ended around 1900 on 2/2.  Also on 2/2, I began getting left flank pain. I thought this was muscular. Throughout 2/2 and 2/3, the flank pain became worse and worse and I realized it may be a kidney stone (I have had a kidney stone before). I left my work shift early on 2/3 to go to the ER at 2100. There, it was a little complicated because I am pregnant and could not receive a CT scan to check for stones. Based on the information gained from ultrasounds and the UA, they decided to treat for pyelonephritis. I left the ER around 0130 on 2/4 and picked up pain medications and 14 days of cefdinir.   I do know this may not be related to the vaccine, but I think we need to report everything in case there are trends.  ER Provider notes as follows: 31 y.o. female who arrived by Home presented to the emergency department for left flank pain that radiates to her left groin. The pain has been present since yesterday and it is sharp in nature. She took tylenol at 7pm this evening, but it did not help with the pain. She is also 12 weeks pregnant. Patient reports that she passed a kidney stone 3.5 years ago. At the time, she was told that she had an additional stone in the left kidney and has been following with urology. She also reports nausea that has improved with Zofran. Denies fever or chills, urinary urgency or frequency, or blood in her urine. Patient had an ultrasound at Hospital two or three weeks ago that showed a viable IUP. This is her third pregnancy. She denies complications with previous pregnancies and reports two prior cesarean sections.  Patient is sitting up in bed, in no acute distress. Vital signs are normal. Patient presents for left flank pain for the past day that radiates into her groin with associated nausea, and she is 12 weeks pregnant. She has a history of a kidney stone three and a half years ago with an additional stone present in the left kidney at the time of diagnosis. Will obtain CBC, CMP, UA, urine culture, POC kidney ultrasound. Given 1L IV NS bolus, IV zofran and IV morphine.   DDx:  Nephrolithiasis versus UTI versus pyelonephritis versus ovarian cyst versus musculoskeletal etiology   On reassessment, UA negative for nitrites and leukocyte esterase but positive for 50-250 bacteria perr hpf. POC kidney ultrasound negative for hydronephrosis and UA negative for blood. POC US showed IUP with FHR in 170s with good fetal movement. POC renal US repeated after 1L IVF without evidence of hydronephrosis. Will treat for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy with cefdenir for 14 days given concern for early pyelonephritis. Nephrolithiasis is still possible but unlikely cause of symptoms as there is no sign of obstructive uropathy on bedside US. Through shared decision making, will not undergo CT limited high for stone evaluation at this time given risk of radiation to fetus. Will discharge home with plan to follow-up with OB and PCP in 1-2 days - also provided Rx for roxicodone and miralax. Strict return precautions discussed.

In the middle of the pain there was a small black dot .  I am an unusually healthy 83 y.o. physical active, ex Marine, with a high tolerance to pain.  So at first I paid no attention to this and went and played pickleball that very day.  But the next day I awoke to find that the foot was not only bright red and swollen, but painful.  I immediately called my doctor and the next morning I had a telephone conference with him.  We discussed the possibility of what could have caused this problem.  Although I am pre-diabetic (111) he ruled out diabetes.  He also ruled out gout. This only left the possibility of an infection.  But since I had not stepped on any nails, etc. the only possibility was a bug bite.  So he prescribed an antibiotic, which I started taking that very day.  After several days the foot got progressively worse and turned into a ulgy, oozing sore and redness grew to the whole left side of my foot.  So I made an appointment with my doctor for a physical visit, however this was delayed until 2/5/21.  By then the swelling and redness had subsided considerably and the wound was healing.  He ordered lab tests to rule out the possibility of diabetes and gout.  He also gave me a prescription for stronger antibiotic and antibiotic ointment.  Unfortunately the lab was by appointment only and I did not get the tests done until 2/12/21.I would not even be writing this except for the fact that on 1/27/21 I also developed a rash all over on my back that was very itchy.  This is when my attention turned back to my vaccine shot, and the reports that Maderna had a track record of rashes from their shots.  So I thought I had better write to see if it would be safe for me to get my 2nd Maderna shot which is scheduled in just 6 days (2/20/21).I do have a history of occasional painful rashes since childhood and I am wondering if the Moderna shot could have possibly triggered one, or both, of these problems?  If it will help I did have photos taken of my foot during this episode and will be happy to send them to you if you feel it necessary?Thank you for your immediate consideration and response.",,,,,,,,,N,01/23/2021,01/26/2021,3,,PHM,,,None,Occasional rashes & hives,,,2,02/15/2021,,Y,,none

Around the 22nd I went over to my granddaughter's home to shower and noticed that my bicep was black, over the next week it spread to the left breast, collarbone to the elbow.  The where the shot there is about a mark on the muscle where I got the shot. On 28th of January, I went to see my doctor, my shoulder was swollen and I could not raise my arm to about my shoulder level. When I try to move I could feel a pain up there. Doctor put ice on it and told me to take Aleve. Since the swelling has went down I am no longer putting ice on it, I am not using heat. I tried to put my arm in  a sling but it is painful. The other pain I feel no pain in my arm is I sit on the couch and put my arm straight out and do not move. The black area on the bicep is almost gone, the darkened area up by my collarbone went away, most of the darkened area is on my left breast. If I rotate my arm counter clockwise or clockwise there is pain there and it feels like it is stretching the muscle. I have also seen Doctor on the 2nd or 4th of this month. I am thinking of going to see him again this week. My doctor thinks that the person who gave me the vaccine, hit a blood vessel and that is what caused the blackness on my arm. The pain is mainly in the collarbone area and in the bicep.

I sat him again and he keep telling everyone he did not felt fine.

On Feb 8, underwent PCR COVID-19 testing, which was negative.  On Feb 12, canceled the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, rescheduled for Feb 19. Since Feb 14 no pain and fever.  Treatment:  1. Because I had a thought that I may be developed a nasopharyngeal Herpes zoster infection, on Feb 11 I started  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day. 2. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times. 3.

On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back.

I had read a Web MD page that came to me prior to that that had said that this is a reaction to the vaccine.  I asked the MA online site and asked if anyone else has gotten it.

By 8:00 PM, my right arm was extremely sore and overall body aches ensued as I began to feel weak. By 9:00 PM, I felt the need to get into bed and had chills, a severe headache and pain over my whole body, accompanied by shooting burning sensations down both arms into my palms and fingers. I had not taken any medication for the discomfort up to this point.  As time went on, my pain became excruciating, I never felt this kind of pain in my entire body. I had pain in areas I never felt pain before like my arms, hands and toes.  I also had extreme pain in the back of my neck, both shoulders, both arms, my hips and knees. The pain was so intense and throbbing, my headache was severe at my temples and I had chills.  I did not take my temp, but I am sure I had a fever, although I was not sweating. I could not sleep at all and finally broke down at 1:30 am and took an Advil.  There was minimal help with the Advil and I slept on and off over the next 4 hours.

Last Saturday and Sunday, (February 13 and 14), it was at its worst, and hurt even to sit down.  Monday, Feb. 15 and Tuesday Feb 16, the rash was still prevalent, but swelling was down  but still feels uncomfortable. I am hoping that it is getting better.

I went to the ER and after extensive testing they ruled out this being an infectious cause, though I was put on PO doxycycline as a precaution. An orthopedic specialist came to see me and determined that my body is essentially rejecting the hardware and I need to have surgery to have it removed. Since then, the swelling has decreased, however I still have persistent pain in my elbow along the site where the hardware is inserted and limited mobility due to pain with certain movements that put tension on this joint.

The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was ""almost like she also had some mild hearing loss"" on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse.

Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can't take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn't think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn't breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can't describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn't drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn't take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn't like it. It wasn't like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn't like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, ""what is this Parkinson's?"". She doesn't even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn't debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it's like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can't even think of what that area is, but it's the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don't atrophy or won't pull. She hasn't told anybody about it. She doesn't like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn't figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her ""brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep."" On Monday she experienced, ""horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band."" Stated that it wasn't a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date.
