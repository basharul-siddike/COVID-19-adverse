Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment.

In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme's disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn't have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn't know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn't want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well.

She also reported that a pencil is difficult to pick up as well, stating that she would need to use both hands to pick it up but would be able to use the pencil once she had picked it up. Caller reported that the tingling comes and goes, and she experiences varying degrees of numbness.  She reported that they are a little numb throughout the day and it may get worse depending on what she's doing. She stated that she isn't a sitter, she has to get up and move. Caller reported that she called her physician, about the side effects she was experiencing and they instructed her to go to the Emergency Room.  She stated that their concern was what was going on and if it could be Guillain Barre disease, which she stated is extremely rare. Caller reported that when she went to the Emergency Room on 09Mar2021, they did not really do any tests.  She stated that in order to see if there were any new lesions for the MS, they would have to do an MRI of her brain. Caller reported that they did not believe that there were any new lesions, that they thought it was old lesions.  Caller reported that they told her to go home and make an appointment with the neurology resident clinic for that week, clarified as last week, week of 09Mar2021.  Caller reported that she called the neurology clinic as she does not currently have a neurologist, and they informed her that they would not be able to get her in for an appointment until the end of Apr2021.  She stated this was not doing her much good. Caller stated that they had wanted to admit her to the hospital, but told her that she could go home if she promised to follow up with the neurology resident clinic. Caller expressed some frustration, stating that she was really trying to reach out to see what she should do regarding the second dose.  Her physician tells her to go to the Emergency Room, the Emergency Room tells her to go to neurology.  She wants to know what will the second dose do.  She stated that she called the (state) chapter of the national MS society this morning, where they informed her that they had not heard any reports of exacerbations from the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller states that getting additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is a lifelong decision.  She stated that Covid may not always be a pandemic, but it could come back like a yearly flu.  She stated that because additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine could be required, she wanted guidance on how to proceed. Her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is scheduled for 25Mar2021.

A 75-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9264, Expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 29Jan2021 at 09:45-10:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient's medical history included ongoing tuberculosis microbacterial infection, ongoing pseudomonas infection, ongoing migraine, episode of Afib (it was only in the 70's). Caller states she has tuberculosis microbacterial infection and pseudomonas infection for which she takes Ethambutol, rifampin, and Zithromax but has been on this for quite a while. Also, her right middle lobe has been removed. No treatments. Concomitant medication included zoledronic acid (RECLAST), intravenously from an unspecified date (about 2 weeks ago) for osteopenia. The caller explains she recently got Reclast, which was for her bones, but she was told it was fine to have this medication and the vaccine. It was an IV medication for osteopenia, and she got it about 2 weeks ago. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (FLU) for immunisation and experienced arm to blow up/ swelling like a baseball/ blew up again like a golf ball, bad allergic reaction, arm starts to itch. Family history included migraine, asthma, allergies, both parents and her brothers all died by 52. Migraine and asthma run in her family and she herself has migraines; her kids have allergies. The patient did not receive prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient did not administer additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. It was unknown if she has ever gotten a Pfizer vaccine. She gets the flu shot but normally gets half doses; One half one week and then the other half the next week. It causes her arm to blow up, which she describes as swelling like a baseball at first then it blew up again like a golf ball; she had a bad allergic reaction. This was around 25 years ago, and she could tell right away it was going to happen because her arm starts to itch right away. This did not happen with this vaccine. She was told by her doctor she could get the full COVID vaccine as it was the fillers, she was allergic to and this vaccine was completely different. Her second dose was due on 21Feb2021. Caller reported feeling sick on an unspecified date in 2021 (mentioned vomiting) since she received the Pfizer shot last Friday. She heard from the nurse that the side effects for the second dose was worse and wanted to check if this was true, since she doesn't want to go through her experience again. Caller, reporting on the COVID vaccine and who thinks she had a bad reaction. Caller explains she got the vaccine on Friday and she has been sick on an unspecified date in 2021 ever since. She knows there are side effect, but she has been vomiting and having dry heaves on 31Jan2021 ever since getting the vaccine. It was explained that this started on Saturday when she got up, on Friday she felt ok. It was remarked that if she didn't know any better, she would think she was having an episode of Afib as her heart feels like it was racing on 31Jan2021 but was not, it was only in the 70's. She just went to the cardiologist also, so she knows her heart was ok. Right now, she feels like her body was shaking, that was the only way she can describe how she was feeling on an unspecified date in 2021. She did not throw up or have dry heaves yesterday just felt nauseous on 03Feb2021 kept food down. The caller explains that she was concerned about the second dose. She has heard that with the second dose that was when most people feel the most side effects. If it wasn't the vaccine it would mean she caught a bug or something. She really thinks this was related to the vaccine as she felt fine on Friday when she got the shot. Her husband and friend who had it are both fine. Relevant tests were none. Investigation assessment were none. The patient did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office for any adverse events. The patient weight might be 128 lbs. since she hasn't eaten. When asked a seriousness criteria the caller says she doesn't think she would have needed to go to the hospital though she doesn't know as she was not able to get out of the house due to the snowstorm. She explains she was not able to get out of bed, she was sick and ill on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events vomiting, dry heaves was recovered on 02Feb2021, not recovered for the events heart feels like it was racing, felt nauseous and unknown for the other events.

They called the paramedics, her mother said that the nurse who gave her the dose left the bus.  The bus was parked in the outer area under a tree at the  stadium because the tent areas were inside.

On 25Jan2021, the small things, like slight headache, waking up in the night feeling like her heart was beating faster, having a funny feeling, out of character than she had experienced for 2 months prior. On 23Jan2021, Aching in muscle after injection given. On 01Feb2021, breathing not as effective. She began to wonder if there was some interaction between the steroids, inhaler and the vaccine. Two days ago, she stopped taking Breztri inhaler, Astra Zeneca lot 6100107E00, Exp Jun2022. She was taking 2 puffs twice daily, morning and night 8-12 hours apart. She said after she got the vaccine, it was not as effective and was not working as well on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She then stated she was not having any problem. She was wondering if it was ok to take second shot next week. Would it be ineffective and was there a correlation between the effectiveness of the shot and what she was taking and was it just a coincidence that they all transpired after she got the shot. Patient was taking Steroid type of Inhaler before-November and up until 2days ago. She stopped taking this because Caller was experiencing rapid heartbeat on 30Jan2021 and dry mouth. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, it got worse because of the Covid 19 Vaccine that she took before, the 22nd of January 1st dose and her 2nd dose was on the 10th of Feb. Caller asks if there's a reaction of having these 2? the Steroid type of inhaler and the Covid 19 Vaccine. She was feeling fatigue on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and feels the inhaler was less effective. Slowly she noticed her breathing was not as good. It was not helping as much. The cramping quit after she stopped taking the inhaler 2 days ago. She was a survivor of Lung cancer for 5 years and has shortness of breath and limited breathing capacity. Her breathing has worsened since getting the vaccine. She was doing well with her breathing and then it was not as effective. It has not changed a lot because shewais not using the inhaler. The Breztri was a replacement for the Anoro. The Anoro inhaler was not as effective. She has been using it for probably 2 years and it was possible she built up a tolerance to it.

Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) medical history included Shingles Oct2020 and flu. other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was not considered as suspect. Her weight was 158-160lbs. Prior to the vaccine, she had a rash that popped up a week before. Her doctor told her to keep taking Zyrtec DM and take Benadryl orally. Caller mentioned a one time occurrence with shortness of breath, and she took Benadryl and that helped. That incidence had nothing to do with the vaccine. She only has a rash when she is allergic to something she has taken internally. She doesn't know what the original rash was from. She thinks it was from using expired deodorant. It was expired for 2 years. She developed the rash under her arms. She was on prednisone for 5 days, and the rash went away. She was fine. Then, 4-5 days later, she could get the vaccine. Then, she received the Pfizer vaccine on 01Feb2021 (Monday), and on 03Feb2021 (Wednesday) she had a rash all over again. It was worse than it was before. She doesn't know if it was related. It was just on her torso/side. When the break out did happen, she had some on her leg too, She was very allergic to sulfa. She was wondering if the Pfizer vaccine breaks down into a sulfaride when it was in the body. She doesn't know whether to get the second vaccine or not. When she was in her 20s, she was on a birth control pill, and she had an allergic reaction to it. The pharmacist said the ingredients in it break down into sulfarides even though sulfa isn't an ingredient. So she as wondering if this was the same. She doesn't have the name, NDC, lot, or expiration for the birth control. She was allergic to sulfa, and she doesn't want it to happen to someone else. She works for the public She got the vaccine at (Address). Her director put them all in line to get the vaccine because she deals with the public. It happened over the weekend. The doctor didn't want to do an oral prednisone this time because of the vaccine. So she gave her a hydrocortisone cream to use on the rash. She thinks it was 2.5. It was like a prickly rash. She could feel it. If she wears something loose then she doesn't feel it. She took a bath with Aveeno oatmeal which aggravated more because of the heat. No details from the Aveeno was provided . She hasn't used creams or perfume since Friday. The rash had gone away with cortisone cream. This time it came back a lot stronger than before. She has pictures if Pfizer would want them.

Medical history included ongoing epilepsy since Oct2015 (officially diagnosed in Oct2015, but the doctors believed it was in her early 20s but she was misdiagnosed for decades), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from 2020 (diagnosed a year ago), sleep apnea since 2016 (patient thought she was diagnosed in 2016), COVID-19 in Nov2020 from which the patient almost died, memory loss (left over COVID symptom) for which the patient was in speech therapy, intermittent body pain (aftereffects of COVID-19), relapse in seizures due to COVID-19, her eyesight was terrible, epilepsy migraines. Concomitant medications included unspecified epilepsy medications. There was no other vaccine given on the same day, or 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received a flu shot and fainted, on an unspecified date. On 08Mar2021 at 11:15, the patient experienced sore arm (pain 2/10). On 08Mar2021 at 22:00, the patient had headache which got progressively worse, then it got so bad she wanted to pop her head off at midnight. On 09Mar2021 at 00:00, the patient had shaking and shivering where it looked like she was convulsing (she had history of epilepsy and knew what a seizure felt like, her husband may have thought she was having a seizure). The patient had chills to the point where she had multiple blankets and could not stop shaking, took her pulse ox and it dropped down to 93. The caller's baseline temperature was 97.1 and her daughter took her temperature and it was 98.9, most people wouldn't consider that a temperature, but it was a temperature for her. The caller kept shaking like that for hours. On 09Mar2021 between 21:00-23:00, the patient had chills again. On 09Mar2021, the patient experienced excruciating body pain (pain 9/10) in very specific parts of her body. On 09Mar2021 by 12:00, the caller's spinal column hurt the worst, the front of her calves and hip joints, the very edges of her back, the spine from the top of her neck to her butt and then next to it was not so bad but the side of her back was excruciating, the butt muscles hurt really bad, the front of her thighs, left arm, 3 left fingers, but not the other 2 fingers. Oddly enough, she was considered a long hauler, it was the places that her occupational therapist and physical therapists were working on. On 09Mar2021 at 00:00, the patient experienced dizziness (that was on and off all day until bedtime last night on 09Mar2021) and vomiting (she couldn't hold down water). On 09Mar2021, the patient was not feeling well enough. On 10Mar2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced diarrhea (she's only gone to the bathroom twice). On Mar2021, the patient experienced exhaustion and no appetite at all. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced a high level of shortness of breath (patient was unsure if this was due to COVID-19). The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures which included an echocardiogram on an unspecified date: her left atrium was enlarged and her cardiac numbers were high, they were going to monitor her heart and the doctors didn't know if it was because she had COVID-19 or if it was that the doctors got lucky and found it, they had nothing to compare it to because she only had this one echocardiogram. The patient had history of epilepsy migraines (can pinpoint the spot where it hurts), she thought she would try sumatriptan succinate (IMITREX) for this headache (her whole head hurt), as it didn't interact with her other medications. The patient also took acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (TYLENOL PM; Lot: GF6062, Expiry: Jun2022), ibuprofen (patient thinks the Lot is QWE2546A, but is unsure) for the headache. The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) which she had from a previous prescription and that made the vomiting stop. The events did not require an emergency room or physician office visit. The patient did not think that the reactions were due to her epilepsy medication. The clinical outcome of excruciating body pain was resolved on 09Mar2021 (it's hard for the caller to say if she has recovered because she had COVID-19 aftereffects and had body pains that come back intermittently), sore arm / front of her calves, front of her thighs, left arm, 3 left fingers, shaking, shivering/chills, pulse ox and it dropped down to 93, spinal column hurt the worst (the spine from the top of her neck to her butt), butt muscles hurt really bad, caller's spinal column hurt the worst, the front of her calves and hip joints, spinal column hurt the worst, the very edges of her back, the side of her back was excruciating, dizziness, vomiting, not feeling well enough,  no appetite at all was resolved on 09Mar2021; headache was not resolved (unless the caller was asleep, she felt the headache); exhaustion was not resolved; diarrhea and high level of shortness of breath was unknown.

EHR was working very slow (at times it was down completely), and MA was unable to fully review patient?s chart prior to vaccine administration. All patients scheduled that morning were scheduled to receive 2nd Moderna dose, which is why the MA felt comfortable administering vaccine after patient verbalized that she was coming in for the second dose of the COVID vaccine. After vaccine was administered, MA asked the patient for the COVID vaccine card to update the information. It was then that he noticed that the first vaccine administered on 02/20/21 was Pfizer, not Moderna. Provider was notified right away and Dr. went into room to speak with patient, explain situation, and offer reassurance. Upon chart review, it was determined that on 02/20/21, Pfizer vaccine had been administered.  Per CDC website ""Interchangeability of COVID-19 vaccine products"" ?In exceptional situations in which the vaccine product given for the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available, any available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series.? The situation that occurred is not what is described above, but it is helpful to know as it is the same outcome ? two different products used, although not ideal, not necessarily harmful. This was discussed with Medical Directors for medical input. All agreed that there is nothing else to do medically for patient as long as she is doing well. She has completed COVID vaccine series, no need to restart series or get a 2nd Pfizer vaccine. 03/26/21 ?

My arm was swollen like a 2x2 area and tender but other than that I felt good. At 9:30 am that same day I started getting a headache and my stomach felt really upset. I didn't throw up but felt like I was going to.  About 10:00 am I really felt sick to my stomach and extremely tired. My headache was more intense and mostly on my right side (same side as my eye and cold sore). By noon I had the chills and was running a temperature over 100. At 3:00 when I got done with work I slept. I was only awake for a total of 1 hour and went to bed for the night at 8:15 pm. I still had a bad headache, upset stomach and chills and my arm was swelling bigger but I slept all night. On Friday, March 26th I woke up and my face looked worse. The cold sore was getting bigger and the bag under my eye was huge making my eye almost shut. I still had  a bad headache and the injection site was getting bigger and stuck out far. It was hot to the touch. It was bright red and bumpy and hurt to touch it. I no longer was sick to my  stomach and I had no fever. My face was still looking awful and about 2:00 pm I started running a fever again. I still had a headache. I still felt tired. On Saturday March 27th, my bag under my eye looked a little better but the cold sore was getting worse. I had a slight headache, no fever and not sick to my stomach. However, the lump at the injection site got huge.  It was the size of the palm of my hand and stuck up about an inch. It was hot to the touch and red.  By 9:00 pm my eye and face were worse and the right side of my face was drooping. On Sunday March 28th 8:00 am my face was worse and itchy. The cold sore was spreading up the right side of my drooping face and my eye was almost shut. I called the Teledoc and had a video call. She said that the vaccine triggered a virus in my system. She called in a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM 4 pills. Took 2 pills at noon and then the last 2 that night before bed. She said to give it 2-3 days and it should clear up. On Monday, March 29th 6:30 am the lump in my arm is a little smaller but my eye is worse. I looked horrible. On Tuesday, March 30th I still had a low grade headache and my lip and right side of my face is kinda numb. I called my doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday, March 31st. On Wednesday, March 31, 2021, I woke up and now had a canker sore inside my top lip on the right side of my face in addition to looking like a monster. I went to the doctor?s office at 7:30 am and she said that I definitely have a virus going on and now I have Bell?s Palsy as a result.

Monday of last week, patient went to the emergency room in a hospital and was told that they thought that the patient had an enlarged heart and severely low potassium and the patient was put on an IV drip of potassium because she could not tolerate the oral potassium and threw up the oral potassium so she was put on two bags of IV potassium.

Reporter also stated that the 2nd of last week, the patient collapsed and an ambulance came and got her on Tuesday of last week though reporter was unsure of the dates. Reporter also mentioned that patient went to a hospital and had severe chest pain and collapsed pressure on her chest. Reporter stated that the patient at that time had the dry cough and stuff and the hospital told the patient that the patient had fluid build up around her heart and lungs which was maybe due to the treatment from the IV potassium and was told she has a weakened heart. It was reported that with a weakened heart, the heart can't process fluid around the lungs and the heart and it puts pressure on heart supposedly. It was reported that on Wednesday last week, the patient went to the emergency room for the 3rd day in a row and already had an appointment with the HCP which was an appointment with her new primary Nurse Practitioner for the first appointment and she confirmed that the patient had fluid on the lungs when she saw the patient.

Reporter stated that the HCP said that stroke, disease or things like that can cause cardiomyopathy and there are various things that can cause it but they can't diagnose what caused this in the patient because she has not had various things and the only she had was the Pfizer COVID shots that hit her very hard and she just turned age 50.

Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn't itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn't take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn't want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn't right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn't nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn't help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn't make her sick, just didn't want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren't really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn't feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn't itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn't think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn't working and her body couldn't get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn't think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like ""oh that second shot."" If she didn't get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn't know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn't take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn't want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn't think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn't know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn't say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn't feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn't eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers' walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers' oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support.

At 1pm I left work for the day (I work from home so simply let my supervisor know) because the pain was so intense I could not focus. The pain was constant & aching in the entire pelvic girdle with sharp random flashes - I would get one in my left hip flexor, then my sacrum, then down my right leg or in my right toes, then in my right TFL, then my left quad, etc. I could not find comfort standing, laying, sitting. I tried stretching, a heating pad, ice...nothing would help. It got steadily more painful to where I couldn't do anything but lay in bad trying to get comfortable from 3-6pm. My neck became tight as well as my rhomboids. When I would try to get up to walk, my sacrum hurt so much and everything was so stiff, it felt as if I had thrown out my back. I was on the border of being delirious from the ongoing & unrelenting pain. At 7pm I took 2 Advil and by 8:30pm it seemed like the edge was coming off a bit. By 10pm I was able to get comfortable enough to sleep. When I got up the next morning I thought I was better but after moving around a little the pain started to come back strongly in my lower back. I took 2 Advil again and that helped immensely. From then on I was SO much better with only occasional flashes of sharpness over the next two days (3/27 & 3/28). I am now totally fine. I have thrown out my back in the past, so I know what that is like and recognize the symptoms. This event was NOT due to anything like that.

COMPARISON: None.   TECHNIQUE: CTA examination of the chest was performed using angiographic technique according to a protocol specifically tailored to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.  Axial, sagittal, and coronal 2D reformatted images were created from the source data and   submitted for interpretation.  In addition, coronal 3D MIP postprocessing was performed on the acquisition scanner.     Radiation dose length product (DLP) for this visit:  396 mGy-cm .  This examination, like all CT scans performed in the Hospital Network, was performed utilizing techniques to minimize radiation dose exposure, including the use of iterative  reconstruction and automated exposure control.   IV Contrast:  85 mL of iohexol (OMNIPAQUE)     FINDINGS:   PULMONARY ARTERIAL TREE:  Right upper and lower lobe pulmonary emboli involving lobar and segmental branches.   LUNGS:  Patchy subpleural opacities in the right upper lobe.  While this may represent fibrosis or pneumonia, appearance consistent with pulmonary infarct.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the bases of the right middle and lower lobes and lingula.  Lungs  otherwise clear.   PLEURA:  Unremarkable.   HEART/GREAT VESSELS:  Unremarkable for patient's age.   MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: No lymphadenopathy or mass.  Esophagus unremarkable.  Trachea and main stem bronchi normal.   CHEST WALL AND LOWER NECK:   Unilateral right-sided gynecomastia.  No lymphadenopathy or mass.   VISUALIZED STRUCTURES IN THE UPPER ABDOMEN:  1 cm low-attenuation mass in the right lobe, nonspecific, but most likely cyst.  Left renal cyst.  Otherwise unremarkable.   OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No acute fracture or destructive osseous lesion.  Impression:    1.  Right upper lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary emboli.  2.  Patchy opacities in the right upper lobe, most likely pulmonary infarcts.  Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia.   The calculated ratio of right ventricular to left ventricular diameter (RV/LV ratio) is 1.2.   This is greater than 0.9, which is abnormal and indicates right heart strain. An abnormal RV/LV ratio has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of 30 day mortality in the setting of acute pulmonary embolism.

On Tuesday, March 16 I went to the Hospital Emergency room.  They did a number of tests and one of them was ultrasound of both of my legs.  They found DVTs in both legs and started me on Lovenox injections.   About 5 years ago I had a DVT in my right leg but never had any pain or other adverse symptoms from this DVT.  Also I was taking Xarelto to prevent any further DVTs.  On Saturday, March 20 I went back to the ER because my leg pain was still bad.  They did new leg ultrasounds and the DVTs were gone.  My left knee still hurts and my doctor is trying to find out why.   Anyway none of this may be related to the vaccine, but everyone is curious of why I would get these new DVTs when I was taking Xarelto daily and I had never had a problem for 5 years.  The other odd thing is that i had so much pain when my prevous DVT had no pain symptoms.  So now I am continuing the Lovenox injections and we are trying to determine why my left knee is still in so much pain.

She received the second dose on 25Feb2021. 48 hours after the second dose she developed a really sore throat way down in the back of her throat. Her tongue also started swelling. She took diphenhydramine (ASSURED) 50mg. Her tongue was swollen the next day and she was unable to swallow solids.  She went to a Covid clinic and was prescribed a diphenhydramine mouthwash. She was still unable to swallow. She has been taking diphenhydramine and Ibuprofen. It waxes and wanes.  She had to take diphenhydramine to go to sleep. She thinks it is a reaction to the vaccine.

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren't like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn't have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn't know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn't feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can't since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn't normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn't believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn't wake up with this eye shut. It wasn't pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn't feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don't really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn't have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can't the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn't really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 07Mar2021 at 14:45 (02:45 pm) at the age of 73-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at the facility. The patient did not receive other vaccines on the same date. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient's medical history included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Sweet's Syndrome. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (AMLODIPINE), lenalidomide (REVLIMID), prednisone, danazol, and clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX); all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6201) on 14Mar2021 (as reported; pending clarification) at 02:45 pm at the left arm for COVID-19 Immunization. The patient also previously took levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) and experienced allergies with both drugs. The patient reported that as a person with MDS and Sweet's Syndrome, he has had a history of experiencing major skin outbreaks but it has been under control for over a year with oral meds. Two days after his 2nd injection he experienced a major Sweet's Syndrome skin outbreak. Apparently, the vaccine reacted with his autoimmune system to trigger a reaction. The injection area was red about the size of a softball with large swollen, red, erythema migrants rash on chest, left arm, with smaller lesions on his neck, face & back. Once the symptoms appeared, the outbreak followed its normal course of action. It took about 5 days to reach its apex; thereafter the symptoms began to slowly subside. He is now into day 9 and have light rashes. By day 12 he expects all traces of the rash to be completely gone. Patient's assessment: he was not allergic to the vaccine but the vaccine set off his immune system. If/when the rash took longer than the normal 6 days to reach its apex, he was prepared to significantly increase his Prednisone. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and post vaccination. The patient did not receive treatment for the events.

He woke up this morning with left-sided facial droop and inability to close his eye completely on the left.  Patient presented to the emergency department for evaluation.  He denies any symptoms otherwise.  He denies any facial numbness, but states that her rather feels like it is ?paralyzed.?  Patient denies any numbness or tingling in his arms or legs.  He denies any unilateral arm or leg weakness.  He denies any visual changes.  No blurry or double vision.  He denies any difficulty with speech or finding words.

He was given an eye shield that he was given eye lubricant to help avoid dry eye.  I did discuss with him that this also may be related to the vaccine given recent administration.

1154798,03/31/2021,IL,52.0,52,,F,,"My 2nd Moderna vaccine was on March 14th, and by March 18th I had a red and itchy rash with hives on both sides of my neck, more on the left side to start, and up a little into my hair.  I took Benedryl (1 pill doses) and after a few days it seemed to subside, so I stopped taking Benedryl.  It came back with a vengeance on the morning of March 26th -- more red, more itchy, and raised patches in some areas.  I took Benedryl (1 pill doses).  By the morning of the 27th, the itchy red grew from the sides of my neck to also being in the center front of my neck, and up behind my ears.   Then I saw redness on my inner thighs, at my ankles, and some red patches on/by my knees, though those did not itch.  Sometimes I'd feel like a wave of heat and then feel more of the rash and itch move up under my chin, up the sides of my face, on my forehead, and up the sides of my head higher into my hair.  After a shower, the patches of red really stand out.  Since March 27th, I've been taking Benedryl as 2 pill doses every 4-6 hours, and putting a Cortizone cream on my neck 3 times a day.  The first uses of the Cortizone cream made it worse before it made it better.  I considered calling my general doctor, but it seemed to have reached its peak.  Today is the 31st, I still have it in all of those same areas, I can see it on my neck, inner thighs, and face, but it's better, not as red, and my neck only itches a little now and then.  I'm not letting my guard down this time though, I will continue taking Benedryl and using the Cortizone cream for a while.    I should add, on the day of my 2nd vaccine, March 14th, that afternoon my right arm was really sore and raised at the injection site and it hurt down a few inches from the site on that arm.  Later, my left arm hurt in the same areas.  That night, I had extremely intense chills from about 10:15 to 11:30 PM when I fell asleep.  The next morning,  March 15th, I woke with a terrible headache, a fever of 100.9, and awful muscle aches behind my neck, throughout my upper back, and on my shoulders. I took Advil then and I went back to sleep for most of the morning.  By noon, I was at 98.8 and I worked (at home).  For the next few days, the muscle aches slowly went away, but once in a while I'd feel a wave of mild headache and dizziness.   I also want to add, when I had my first Moderna vaccine in my right arm on February 14th at 11:00 AM, that afternoon my right arm was really sore and raised at the injection site and it hurt down a few inches, and later my left arm also  in the same areas.  I was really tired that evening and went to bed really early.  About a week after my vaccine, I noticed a reddness on the top of my forearms, I didn't think it was itchy in the daytime, but it must have been overnight because in the mornings I'd see marks where I had scratched at it.  It started worse on my left arm, but was on both arms, it was red and areas looked like a heat rash.

Medical history included lumbar spine infusion (operations on spinal cord) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient needed the call handler to speak slowly, she doesn't feel that well. She had the first dose of BNT162B2 last 03Mar2021 and the second dose will be on 23Mar2021. She said something was happening to her arm but it was not where the needle went in, that is not where it is. It hurt there at where the needle went in, in the beginning but now it hurts down toward the elbow and it penetrates through the epidermis, endodermis and the muscle and feels like it's at the bone. She hopes it was not a blood clot. She has been looking at the website and they say people could have blood clots and she does not know if this was a blood clot, she can't hardly lift her arm, it was the left side that the shot was in because her right side is partially paralyzed due to effect of lumbar spine infusion and so when she tried to get up sometimes she can hardly lift that arm and so she didn't know what to do if she should call the primary care doctor to see if she has a clot but she read it and it says to call this number if you are having compactions and she been on hold over and hour and a half. It was hurting and the feeling like she couldn't hardly raise the arm or get any kind of strength in it. She knew in Europe they have had few people who have had blood clots, and she thought could that be a sign of a blood, like blood not moving through her veins like it is supposed to. It is not moving it has not made it to her heart yet. She says it is associated with the product, this is the only thing she has had in her arm she knows it is the product. She said her birthday just passed. She turned 75 years old but when the issue started in her arm she was 74 years old. It did not start the first week, the first week it was just sore around where the shot went in but then last week it started happening where it was hurting down her arm and she was getting close to the second shot which she doubts she will have but it is the 23rd which is next week. She used to be 5'2"" but the operations on her spinal cord, she guesses she might be 4''10 now.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn't have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn't know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can't understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn't have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn't like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn't have any energy to move. He didn't know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn't ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine's job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can't learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that's why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn't match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them.

He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it's dramatically changing his life, he can't even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient's doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn't cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today.

Clarified the pain was not at the injection site; her upper arm and maybe to her elbow was just sore, no swelling or redness, just sore arm. This lasted through the next couple of days after the shot. Patient mentioned that she absolutely did not have much of a reaction; she has had issues with bee stings in the past, described as big, huge swelling and redness, no breathing associated with it. Patient stated she has been told that is a reaction. She clarified she did not have anything like that on the day of the injection itself. She is in between doctors right now; she doesn't have PCP. She hears from friends that the PCPs do a lot of diagnosing and treatment over the phone. She doesn't know if it's a state thing because she's been to dermatologist, eye doctor, had her teeth cleaned twice at the dentist during this pandemic. It feels like maybe she has some aches; her neck is kind of stiff, maybe because she has been in bed all day, because of her age, she can feel aches and pains more often. Patient also mentioned that in the morning, it takes her a while to get the body parts moving. She has not been up and has been in bed. She is laying back down again because her neck or back of her head felt kind of stiff. No treatment was taken. She did not take or eat anything today yet because her stomach has been upset. It has been 4 days since she received the vaccine, and she would assume she would've gotten the side effects closer to the day of injection. She is scheduled for the second dose on 29Mar2021, and she has questions about that: if this means anything, is this connected to the injection. Headache started at about 6 AM when she woke up this morning. She has been holding off on taking Aleve or Excedrin because of the upset stomach waiting for that to calm down because she does not want to throw up. She does not feel like eating. She has not eaten yet, but she knows she needs to. She doesn't know if it's her neck or the back of her head, but it is kind of painful when she stands up. Her stomach might feel a little better, not that she's hungry, but she's thinking more that she needs to eat whereas this morning she was not going to do it and didn't care. She has basically been in bed all day; she spent more than an hour on hold. Clarified that she was not sleeping, but in bed. When she got up, she noticed pain in her neck or back of head. She had not been up long enough to tell if it's still going on, she just got up once or twice for a quick bathroom break. She does not know when the pain started, she could've had the pain before, but she just noticed it. Patient mentioned that while she is laying down, it doesn't hurt.  Aches were Neck/back of head is kind of stiff; kind of painful when she stands up exact time unknown but hurts when she gets up. She had nothing on the day of; she was bragging to everyone it didn't hurt. Caller clarified the upper left arm to bottom of arm was sore. She asked one of her friends if she had a sore arm after the shot and she said no. No additional information provided. she just went back to bed and figured she'd sleep it off.

A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The r center in which she got the first shot of the vaccine neglected to call her for her second dose appointment. She wanted to know if there are any recommendations for the vaccine shot given after 42 days. Caller wanted to know how to get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She also wanted to know if the dose is allocated to her since the facility has failed to give her the second dose of the vaccine in time. Response: Gave the phone number of the Department of Health hotline in their website. Caller mentioned she has no computer to look at the website. She was calling about the Covid 19 vaccine. She got her first Covid 19 vaccine at a nursing facility, a rehabilitation place . Later in the call it is clarified that she was a patient at the facility and the  pharmacy came and provided the Covid 19 vaccines to the residents.  After she was discharged from the facility they  didn't call her to schedule her second vaccine and she kept calling them about it. She was discharged from the facility on 11Feb2021. Finally, on 11Mar2021 she got the piece of paper that showed she had received her first Covid 19 vaccine. But the facility  neglected to call her to schedule the second Covid 19 vaccine. She thinks she can only get the vaccine from that facility because the dose was allocated to her. It's been 42 days on 14Mar2021 since she received the first Covid 19 vaccine. She's called everywhere on the phone since she got that paper stating the administration date of the first Covid 19 vaccine on 01Feb2021. She is asking if the facility is responsible for getting the Covid 19 vaccine to her. The facility never called her back for her second appointment. She's called today and the facility staff is always in a meeting or have left for the day. She's confused. When she called the health department, they said that she never showed up for her appointment and so she didn't get the second Covid 19 vaccine. She reports her son, who was 51 years old died in Feb2021 from a heart attack and they are using that as an excuse. The facility isn't working with her. She understands she can't get the second Covid 19 vaccine unless she shows them, she had received the first. She only got the paper proving she got the first Covid 19 vaccine on 11Mar2021. She's been calling everywhere, the Department of health and the department of aging. She is sickly now and she has heart problems. When querying facility name where she received her Covid 19 vaccine she says the pharmacy came to the facility where she was a patient. She was in the hospital.  It was recommended that at discharge she go to a rehabilitation center. She was sent to a facility. She was discharged from the facility to her home on 11Feb2021.  Communication: Advised caller to reach out to the facility where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and to the  pharmacy that came to the facility to administer the Covid 19 vaccine for scheduling. The caller was provided with the phone number instructions to dial option 3, and business hours prior to transfer to queue. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 63-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Mar2021 11:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history predating treatment with the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine included fracture on that left foot where the toenail came off and she had a wound that wouldn't heal. She was fully recovered from the foot injury in Dec2020. Then she came down with a positive COVID 19 test on 11Dec2020. Symptoms started on 07Dec2021 with a fever and everything and she ended up in the ER with bilateral pneumonia and they sent her home on 17Dec2020. Then later, she was admitted to the hospital on 25Dec2020 with excruciating pain in her chest, lungs and legs; and she was having shortness of breath. She was found to have a  DVT, PE and bilateral pneumonia. She was discharged 30Dec2020. She thinks she has the long time syndrome after COVID. She was still having shortness of breath, itchiness, and extreme fatigue from the COVID 19 infection but her HCP advised her to get the COVID 19 vaccine anyway. She thinks the chest congestion and cough were cleared up now, but she has noticed hair loss. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient stated that her husband, son and herself received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 02Mar2021. They all waited the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine for a reaction and was fine. Her husband and son went ahead to the car and she went to use the restroom. 20 minutes later, while in the restroom, she got a random ting outside her left foot like an electrical type very painful pain that came up the outside left ankle, leg, and calf. She had an excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf/ zinging sensation left ankle on 02Mar2021. The pain was from the same foot that she had broken before. It happened once and she was like what was that and then it stopped. Maybe 5 seconds went by then it happened again this random zap of electrical feeling that she cant really explain but it gave her whole body goosebumps. It did it 5 times in a row with pauses in between in the same exact place left lower leg. After it stopped and as she was washing her hands she had a really sharp pain in her breast on 02Mar2021 and then that was it. She walked out to the car and she didn't say anything to her husband or son because she didn't really understand what was happening and she felt fine other than the crazy pain and once it ended it ended. When she got home and in the afternoon because she was home working remotely it happened again the same exact spot left lower leg and the pain was excruciating when it was happening. This time she thinks it was four times in a row with pauses in between same exact spot just in her left lower leg. This time she told her husband ""I didn't say anything before but its happening again and its weird."" She never had this feeling before. Adds it was so excruciating. She was just holding her breath counting how many times it will occur. It happened again that night and then she almost afraid to go to sleep because the pain would wake her up but nothing happened as she slept. She woke up the next morning and had to go to an ophthalmologist appointment and happened again while she was sitting in the chair. She had another episode of the painful zing in her foot. That was the last time it did and it might have happened again but altogether she had 4-5 episodes in a 24 hour period after receiving the vaccine. Each time she would have several painful zings. She also noticed a tingling on her lip on 03Mar2021; a painful zinging sensation on her right breast; and a tingling sensation on one finger of her hand that happened one time on 03Mar2021. That day, she had a tingling in one finger and a zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip and that was it those didn't really bother her they were more tingling and electrical feeling. She called her primary doctor and he hadn't heard of anything like it before but he cant rule it out. He said the only way you would know is if you got the shot again but she states she is a little scared. She would like to know if this side effect has been reported before and if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She was scheduled to receive the next dose on next Tuesday, 23Mar2021.

She had a headache, nausea, weakness, and disorientation when walking. Stated she obviously had pain at the site of injection. Stated some of it was her own fault, and at first she felt fine. On the same day that she got her second dose of the covid vaccine, she had a glass of wine and was not too hungry. She ate a little that evening. The next morning she passed out. Clarified that she had two glasses of wine, not one. Caller's daughter was a doctor. Caller referd to her daughter as doctor daughter. Stated that she told her daughter about what happened. Her daughter told her it was because she was dehydrated. Her daughter told her that it was called vagus something or another. Her daughter was not there with the caller. Her daughter called it vagus something, she does not remember. Her daughter told her that it had to do with inflammation and her immune system. Caller stated she also has arthritis. Her daughter told her that she was stupid for drinking wine after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine and not eating a full meal. Whenever she passed out and fell, she did not hurt herself but it was a wake up call. She realized she was vulnerable. She was calling because she did not know why no one told her to drink a lot of water after receiving the vaccine. She got a Prolia shot in July and the nurses told her to drink a lot of water. She was asking why the nurses who gave her the covid vaccine are not saying that to people. Her daughter told her to call the doctors office about this, and she told her daughter that it was over with now, she's 95%, she was a little tired on 18Mar2021.

Luckily whenever she started to get dizzy, she braced her self, whenever she fell, she did not fall from an upright position. She was crouched over, and fell against trays that fell with her. Her doctor daughter told her that inflammation was because of her immune system. One other thing was that she has been stung in the past and had extreme reactions from yellow jackets in the 90's. She thought her immune system was sensitive. One other things related to her autoimmune from 3 years ago. She moved to a city in 2012. Everyone told her after 5 years she would develop allergies. In 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms. It was not just like a topical thing where she scratched and itched, it was under her skin. She went to a dermatologist and he took a biopsy, but the results just said eczema. She went to an allergist, he finally found a space on her underarms where he could do a test. The test showed that she had mild allergies to mold and juniper. Juniper is a tree that they have there, she has one in her back yard. Her allergy was very mild. She tried everything, and in 4 months it went away. Now she just latherers her skin with coconut oil. Her diagnosis that this autoimmune issue was related her immune response from the yellow jacket reaction is a self diagnosis. A doctor had never told her this, this was coming from her own self. Clarified that she is calling about the second dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Headache: It was not a bad headache, it was more like pressure all across the top.

They put iv fluids and I stayed there for 7-8 hours. Then they sent me home and said this is a  vaccine reaction and will go away.

In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray ""showed something abnormal"" so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a ""huge pulmonary embolism."" D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was ""100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.""  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the ""genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient's family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues."" Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed ""an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already."" Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to ""blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational"" per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient's shortness of breath resolved ""immediately after clot was removed"" but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.
