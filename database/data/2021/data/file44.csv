UTI's can, we are told, cause instability and apparently more so in older people. So this is another conceivable cause.

The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn't get into them and she didn't want to go to the ER. She didn't have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn't able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn't get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn't want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn't had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor's office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn't as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021.

Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn't had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well.

About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient's other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn't changed his medications or habits and it's odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can't figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn't know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn't know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that's the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn't change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from ""Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness"". The outcome of the other events was unknown.",,,,,Y,1,,,N,01/26/2021,02/01/2021,6,Test Date: 20210317; Test Name: Balance test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Unknown results; Test Name: Cholesterol level; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Always good; Test Name: Glucose levels; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Always good; Test Name: Blood work; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Always good; Test Date: 202102; Test Name: Blood work; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 20210310; Test Name: Exercise stress test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 202102; Test Name: CTs of his head; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 202102; Test Name: Echocardiograms of his heart; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 202102; Test Name: EKGs; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 20210317; Test Name: VNG test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Unknown results; Test Name: All other tests; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 202102; Test Name: MRIs of his head; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal; Test Date: 20210310; Test Name: Nuclear stress test; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:Normal,UNK,,AMLODIPINE; ESOMEPRAZOLE; CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50+; OMEPRAZOLE,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Acid reflux (esophageal); Blood pressure abnormal; Vitamin supplementation,,USPFIZER INC2021317328,2,04/03/2021,,Y,Y,

The reporter added that there was a massive infection that involved all internal organs (unspecified date) and the doctors were bewildered by the event because the patient did not have any prior pain. The reporter informed that the doctors have said that the patient had massive infection in and around all organs in that area. The reporter informed that they can't understand how it would happen so fast, they'd ask her if she had any pain in advance. The reporter stated ""no, she was fine before and after the shot but then four days later (13Mar2021), all of a sudden the patient had excruciating pain"".

The reporter informed that they have been able to force the numbers back to closer where they would like to be.

The reporter informed that nobody has said there was any connection. The reporter informed that it seemed that there was a possibility that it was connected to the vaccine because in an otherwise healthy person, it was hard to explain.

In 2021, they took her to the emergency room (ER) and they did a battery of test including computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood test, urine, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain.

Later that same day I looked on my abdomen and right torso and notice an additional red rash on my right torso, under my arm, leading from my navel.  Itching became intense and the pain started. Vesicles stared on the 18th and I was unable to get an appointment until the 19 the where the MD confirmed Shingles. I was started on Valtrex (generic) 1 tab bid for 7 days. The pain was so intense, I was unable to have any clothing, bedding touch the area. I had a fever, chills, intense pain, with inability to raise right arm due to pain.  There was also a lymph node that was tender and swollen under my right arm.  Treatments included Calamine lotion and OTC Lidocaine applied topically and the fever and headache were managed with Tylenol 500 mg every 3-4 hours until it became unbearable and I requested additional pain meds.  The MD gave me Oxycodone which helped some. The lymph node were no longer tender and sore by day the 28th or so.  The lesions/vesicles started to dry up by 04/02/21 but the  itching persisted and remained very painful. The back pain persisted throughout with difficulty sleeping due to the pain.  By the 4th of April, the lesions had dried completly and all the scabs had fallen off. Some of the nerve pain persisted but clothing was more bearable by this time.

Later that day, I started to experience some brain fog and fatigue. this resolved itself after approximately 4 hours. On  3/3/21 I took my dose of Humira that I use for Crohn's Disease and about 3 hours later experienced extreme fatigue. I have been on Humira for 3.5 years and I have never experienced a reaction to the Humira like this. On 3/4/21, the next day after taking my Humira, I once again experienced extreme fatigue, a very bad headache and horrible brain fog to the point where the things I was reading on my computer and things people were saying to me was not making sense. I was also very nauseated and had severe diarrhea. I was tested for Covid just to be sure and I was negative. I went home and fell asleep and slept for 6 hours. I did feel better upon waking up.  Approximately one week later I experienced a sever migraine with visual disturbances.  On 3/15/21 I began having  a Crohn's flare. I had been in remission for 3.5 years with my last colonoscopy in October of 2019 showing  this and that my Crohn's ulcers had improved. I went to the ER on 3/16/21 in severe pain, was found to be in a flare with inflammation and swelling in my small intestine and a partial blockage. I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days where I received IV steroids and fluids. I was sent home on oral prednisone and now have to add additional medication to my Humira regimen for my Crohn's.  I am sure that some will say that none of this is related to the Moderna vaccine I received, but I have had no issues with my Crohn's in 3.5 years until I had this vaccine. All of my issues this past month coincide with receiving the vaccine and I have never had any side effects whatsoever from the Humira. In fact, it's always made me feel better when I've been due to take it, so I know that my symptoms are not from the Humira.

I had also developed an inflamed, painful large sore under the left side of my tongue & was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Dental Paste to use 2 x daily on the sore.

On early morning of 04/02/2021 arm became very discolored (mostly bright red/scarlet color) between elbow and just below vaccination injection site.  Through the course of the weekend arm became worse but the initial pain changed to irritation/itching primarily.  On 04/05/2021 at 6 a.m. upon wakening arm was still vividly discolored but my blood pressure reading first thing was high (197/99 with a 90 pulse) which is very unusual for me now.  Not only that but I also experience at same time a nose bleed.  Since other than assuming in general that the arm discoloration connected somehow to the vaccination I had no idea if the spike in BP also connected and the nose bleed (since I rarely have any nose bleeds) I went to the ER - which is a small county hospitals about 3 miles from my home.  I did not attempt to take a Clonidine at home before going there as I wanted them to see if there was a connection between these 3 issues.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was taken again and it was the same high numbers as  at home not long before.  The ER doctor on duty that morning unfortunately didn't seem to  know what might be wrong with my arm and so she focused on bringing down my blood pressure by instructing a nurse to give me a Clonidine.  Within about a half hour when my BP had returned to normal they dismissed me to go home without any actual information as to whether the 3 issues were connected of not and without obviously having a clue as to what the situation was with my arm.   During the course of the day my daughter did some research on the internet and determined that it must be 'COVID Arm' that I was suffering from.  First thing the next morning (04/03/21) I called my GP doctor's office to try to get an appointment but unfortunately he was fully booked and so instead I called the the local Health Department and spoke with one of the nurses who works in their COVID Vaccination program.

Jan 25: pain in both legs at a 3-4, also mild pain in left arm (1-2) as well as joint pain. Jan 26: pain in left arm more severe, leg pain similar in severe.

Have been doing stretches since which has helped the leg pain. Starting on March 12, I began to have pain in my left arm again, and ended up getting vertigo that evening. The arm pain persisted on and off from then on out, as well as occasional dizziness, which I treated with Dramamine. I did get an appointment scheduled with a neurologist in May that I still have. On March 25, I began to feel unwell, with a fever, dizziness, and a headache. That worsened into the evening, and I woke up at around 3 am with a high fever, that ended up going to about 103 F, and began vomiting around 4:30am on Friday, which persisted into the evening. On Saturday evening I began to feel better. With that recovery, the constant leg pain and frequent arm pain seemed to be gone, and has yet to return to the degree that it had been prior to that bout of sickness.

My HR was 90's which is high, my resting is 40's-50's. Arms would feel heavy with this.  This happened later in the day again,  Very unsettling, was in contact via text with cardiologist I work with ( I am an ARNP) and my Dr that is listed on this form.  They told me I could keep taking Benadryl and Pepcid q 6-8hrs.  I was also given prescription for prednisone if needed.   Following day went about 8 hrs between doses, same symptoms took Prednisone that eve, I believe 10mg this was in addition to Benadryl and Pepcid.  These  episodes kept happening for about 5-6 days.  On Friday, 3 days after 2nd dose, I tried to space out meds. then in afternoon about 4:40 was actually short of breath and felt tight with breathing.  So took meds and actually considered using my son's old inhaler.  Symptoms resided in about half hour after meds.  Last dose of meds was Sunday 8 PM after 2nd vaccine.  Ran in  morning and HR would not come down, stayed in 110's very unusual for me, I felt SOB.  Had EKG when I went to office but just prior to EKG symptoms resolved and I was SR in 70's  Had BMP and Mg these were NL. I run daily and had noted increased SOB and HR after first vaccine this continued until just a few weeks ago.   We feel this was some type of allergic reaction with possible mast cell activation.

These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I'm sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn't even grip anything.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/03/2021,04/03/2021,0,None.

Throughout, my diet, dietary supplements, residence, sleep, environment, and daily routine remained the same -- and the same as they had been for months before.

The discharges of gas reduced considerably in frequency and copiousness and were no longer abnormally foul-smelling. As of this day, however, flatulence still seems somewhat more than usual. Of course, I cannot unerringly testify to a cause-and-effect relationship between the vaccination and the symptoms I have described. But I see no other likely candidate for a cause.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Mar2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.

About 20 minutes after she took the shot, she started feeling bad and became nauseated/felt sick to stomach. On 09Mar2021, the top part of her stomach would hurt, and she started developing a cough. On 11Mar2021, the patient felt like she doesn't have any energy. The coughing went pretty bad so on 12Mar2021, the patient took a COVID-19 PCR test and it came back negative. The patient kept having a bad cough so then they went to the doctor where they put the patient on prednisone 20 mg and amoxicillin 875 mg on 12Mar2021. On 16Mar2021, the patient went to the family doctor and the doctor put the patient on azithromycin and gave her a steroid shot. Then the patient kept coughing and her stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage. The patient was never getting better or anything. So, on 18Mar2021, the patient had COVID-19 Virus test where they swabbed her nose and the test came back negative. The patient was taken to the hospital on 19Mar2021 at 11:30 where they did an x-ray of the patient's lungs and her O2 level was 82-86 sitting in the bed (also reported as 84-86 so she was put on oxygen), performed CT scan of her lungs and it looked like there was inflammation in the lower lungs that was rubbing on her diaphragm, and performed Chest CT which determined pneumonia. That night they did another COVID-19 virus test where they went really deep and it came back negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the night of 19Mar2021. The patient was given IV ceftriaxone, IV azithromycin, azithromycin (also reported as Zythromax), one breathing treatment, and they said they may have to send the patient home with some oxygen. It was also reported that on 19Mar2021, the patient did really good with coughing, she didn't cough that much. The patient had a dry cough that wasn't productive at all. The patient acted kind of short of breath because she wasn't breathing deep because of the pain in the top part of her stomach, but the reporter doesn't believe it was true shortness of breath. When the patient got out of the hospital on 22Mar2021, she didn't need to come home with the oxygen. The patient's oxygen level is running pretty good at the time of the report, in the lower 90s (Mar2021). The patient was on Decadron 6 mg for 5 days and she's doing pretty good, she still has a little bit of a cough. It was also reported that in Mar2021, the patient only ate about half of her breakfast, this lasted for several days, she wouldn't eat much. The patient pretty much recovered from the nausea. When she ate, it felt like everything would make it to her stomach and just sit there. The emergency room doctor said it could be from gastroenteritis, also they gave the patient several rounds of Protonix. The patient usually takes Nexium every night.

My cycle then returned to normal.  It seemed very coincidental that this happened immediately following the vaccine, and was not normal for me at all.  I recently read similar stories of other women reporting this, so while at the time it was concerning, I did not report it.  I am a firm believer in science and thought this was possibly just a fluke, but felt that after reading many stories of women having a similar experience, that the responsible action is to report this, to ensure that all of the data is being studied, since the vaccine is so new.  That being said, I only had mild side effects from the vaccine, and I am very grateful that I was able to receive the vaccine, as I have known quite a few people that have died from COVID.  This bleeding for me was not dangerous at any time, and while I was a bit faint, the bleeding during the course of the month did slow down and this all resolved.

I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn't from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn't been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever.

I was instructed to follow up with my primary care physician which I did on 3/26.

Shortly before the reaction I had eaten a can of ravioli and some bread.  The can from a 12 pack that we bought at the grocery store approximately 6 months ago.  It as the last can in the pack and I did not have a reaction to any of the previous cans.  I met with my family Dr's PA the following week and she indicated that while there is no way to know with 100% confidence that the reaction was from the shot, she noted that it was highly unlikely that my reaction was from the ravioli can.

He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color.

He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.

He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever.
