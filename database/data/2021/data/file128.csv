The patient's concurrent conditions included euthyroid sick syndrome and underlying autoimmune Addison's disease/undiagnosed autoimmune adrenalitis. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  The primary objective of this study was to recognize adrenal crisis (AC) in patients without known adrenal insufficiency after vaccinations.   On an unknown date, in preparation for school, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; dose, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) for prophylaxis. The batch number was not reported.  On the same day, the patient was vaccinated with non-company co-suspect DTaP (diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular, tetanus vaccine toxoid; dose, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) for prophylaxis. The batch number was not reported.  On an unknown date, two days after receiving with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent and co-suspect DTaP, the patient experienced generalized body aches, fatigue and malaise.   On an unspecified date, five days after vaccinations, the patient experienced mid-abdominal discomfort associated with scant vomiting with associated decreased appetite and fluid intake.  On an unspecified date, six days after vaccinations, the patient experienced tingling and numbness of feet and toes.  On an unspecified date, one week after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent and non-company co-suspect DTaP, the patient presented to the emergency room (ER). His family had brought him to the hospital as he had been lethargic and appeared cyanotic. The patient denied fever, chills, rash, joint swelling, joint pain, neck stiffness or pain, sore throat, sinus drainage or pressure, urinary complaints, or bowel changes. He also denied recent travel or sick contacts. In the ER, the patient was lethargic, bradycardic with a heart rate of 30 beats per minute and had low blood pressure at 90/60 mmHg. On examination, he had a cold, as well as clammy skin that was mottled in color. Initial laboratory tests were: haemoglobin was 16.9 g/dL (normal range 13.7-17.5), sodium was 102 mmol/L (normal range 136-145), potassium was 6.2 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1), aspartate aminotransferase was (AST) 299 U/l (normal range 15-37) and alanine aminotransferase was (ALT) 124 U/l (normal range 30-65). Additionally, the patient's urine analysis was unremarkable. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and started on fluids and given a prophylactic dose of ceftriaxone. A cortisol level was drawn, and the patient was given a dose of dexamethasone for the possibility of adrenal crisis (AC) in light of concurrent hyponatremia, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and coloration improved. Due to this positive response, he was started on intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone. Subsequent laboratory tests were: cortisol was 0.69 mcg/dL (normal range 4.3-22.4), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was >2000 pg/mL (normal range 7.2-63.3), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA) was <15 mcg/dL (normal range 80.0-560.0), total testosterone was 200 ng/dL (normal range 264-916), free testosterone was 0.8 pg/mL (normal range 9.3-26.5), 21-hydroxylase antibodies were 40 U/mL (normal range <1), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 5.25 mcInU/mL (normal range 0.36-3.74) and thyroxine (T4) was 1.62 ng/dL (normal range 0.89-1.76). The low cortisol level prior to the treatment combined with improvement in clinical status following glucocorticoid treatment was consistent with adrenal crisis. Diagnostic laboratory testing that demonstrated an elevated ACTH along with a decreased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA), total testosterone, and free testosterone, and elevated 21-hydroxylase antibodies were consistent with autoimmune Addison's disease. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) that was slightly elevated, with a normal T4, was suggestive of euthyroid sick syndrome. Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen showed no gross adrenal enlargement or abnormalities. Blood cultures did not grow any organisms. With continued treatment with steroids, the patient's severe hyponatremia and other electrolyte abnormalities were corrected.   On an unspecified date the patient was discharged from hospital. On discharge, the endocrinologist recommended starting the patient on maintenance mineralocorticoid. The patient was educated on the course of the disease and the need for exogenous steroids for maintaining good health.  On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from the events of 'adrenal crisis', 'tingling' and 'numbness in feet'.    In conclusion, acute adrenal insufficiency, also known as adrenal crisis, was a rare but known life-threatening condition. Patients with adrenal insufficiency may go undiagnosed until they have significant stressors inducing like in this case where adrenal crisis was induced by influenza and DTaP vaccination. All vaccines are known to cause fever, fatigue, and gastrointestinal disturbances by themselves, thereby making it difficult to diagnose AC. As infections are a major precipitant of AC, receiving future routine vaccinations should not be barred in patients with AI or those who have AC secondary to vaccinations.   The reporter assessed the events as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent and DTaP. Adrenal crisis was induced by influenza and DTaP vaccination in a patient without a known history of adrenal insufficiency. It was also considered that as the patient had received two vaccines simultaneously, this potentially increased the stressor burden.   The event of 'adrenal crisis' was assessed as serious due to hospitalization, medical significance and life-threatening condition. The events of 'tingling' and 'numbness in feet' were assessed as serious due to hospitalization.  Company Comment: A 21-year-old, male patient was vaccinated with the suspect product influenza virus vaccine polyvalent and non-company co-suspect DTaP vaccine. Within five days the patient developed abdominal discomfort and vomiting with associated decreased appetite and fluid intake. The patient developed paraesthesia and numbness six days after vaccination. After seven days the patient presented at the emergency room with sings and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (AI). The patient was given a dose of dexamethasone for the possibility of adrenal crisis (AC) with improvement of blood pressure, heart rate, and coloration. Performed laboratory and diagnostic findings were consistent with underlying Addison's disease and euthyroid sick syndrome both of which confound causality. Additionally, causality was confounded by concurrent administration of DTaP vaccine increasing the stressor burden. As per reporter patients with AI may go undiagnosed until they have significant stressors inducing an AC. Therefore, causality for the event adrenal crisis is assessed as possibly related although confounded by underlying condition. Causality for the events paraesthesia and numbness is assessed as possibly related based on plausible temporal relationship.; Reporter's Comments: The reporter assessed the events as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent and DTaP.

His white blood cell count was 17, rapid COVID-19 test negative, creatinine 1.6 (baseline 2.3), sodium 122.  CXR with infiltrates.  Patient was admitted on Rocephin and Zithromax.  Blood cultures drawn on 10/4/21 remained negative.  Evaluated on 10/5 he reported that he was feeling much better.  Sodium was improving up to 127 and creatinine remained around baseline.  The patient was able to go down to room air and he was saturating above 90% on room air until 10/8 when he required oxygenation.   He was still hypertensive and he was placed on Procardia XL and metoprolol although he just got 2 or 3 doses of the beta-blocker due to bradycardia.  On 10/8 the patient started worsening clinically.  He had hallucinations and he became hypoxic that morning at 88% on room air therefore he was placed initially on 3 L nasal cannula.  A repeat confirmatory COVID-19 test was ordered.  Repeated CT scan demonstrated some improvement on infiltrates with some edema however clinically the patient was worse and he became more confused agitated and disoriented.  CT scan of the head did not show any abnormalities.  His sodium got low again.  His D-dimer was elevated but he could not have CTA done due to renal function and he was not stable to lay flat for VQ scan so he was a started empirically on heparin drip.  Antibiotics were broadened to Zyvox and cefepime.  The patient had alternating periods of encephalopathy and being fully alert and oriented. On 10/9 the patient was placed on Vapotherm 40 L 100% FiO2 but throughout the morning he was able to go down to 70% FiO2.  His renal function got significantly worse and he also developed hyperkalemia.  His confirmatory COVID-19 test came back negative and his sodium continued to get worse again.

Lactic acid was around 10.  He was more encephalopathic and with decreased responsiveness.  He developed bradycardia in the 20s and received 1 dose of atropine plus Levophed.  The patient was intubated and transferred downtown.  Critical care concluded that his respiratory failure was mainly due to volume overload due to worsening renal failure.  The patient was a started on CRRT for volume management.  Patient also was found having shock liver although he did not have significant hypotension but he was significantly bradycardic.  Hepatitis panel and all the testing for check liver etiologies came back negative.  Patient was able to be extubated on 10/13.  Nephrology recommended continuation of hemodialysis.

On 06/15/21 is my 1st hospitalization for PVCs. Severe palpitations start when leaning back. Taking magnesium to help control the PVCs and I started sleeping sitting up. Worst during sleep in early morning. Better during the day but still present. Went to MD and had EKG. MD recommended I go to hospital. Hospital put in an IV line but did not give me fluids. Still had PVCs, but felt better when released from Hospital. PVCs diagnosed, but no underlying heart issues.  Followed up with PCP. He found my Vitamin D was low so I started taking Vitamin D. Hospital prescribed beta blockers, which I tried. They made PVCs worse at night, and I developed chest pain.   On 07/09/21 is my 2nd hospitalization at Medical Center for chest pain and PVCs. They gave me an IV which helped my chest pain. Still had PVCs but chest pain subsided. Released from hospital. Again no underlying heart issues. Was finally able to see a cardiologist, who prescribed heart monitoring.   Saw an allergy specialist, at Hospital because I suspected something I was eating was making the PVCs worst. Went on an anti-inflammatory heart healthy diet with olive oil which helped. Decided to replace the fish oil I was taking with flaxseed oil. Stopping the fish oil helped. When I tried to stop the flaxseed oil, PVCs got worse.  Although I still need to sleep sitting up; the PVCs started to improve with the diet change, avoiding stress, time and rest. Can still get chest pain under stress. The pain was especially worst on my left side and into my left arm. Stopped wearing my smart watch monitor which is on my left arm.

I got a very bad headache and no over-the-counter pain relievers helped. Now three weeks after the vaccine I still have headaches on and off every day. At the same time of getting the vaccine, I got diarrhea that lasted 3 days. My body has hurt and ached and I have felt lethargic ever since. The injection site on my arm had a large knot that looked like a flesh-colored tennis ball had been cut in half and attached to my arm and was extremely painful. The pain and knot lasted roughly 5 days. Smells that I used to enjoy like a scented candle or bacon cooking now have a vile odor. Food has now turned into something that at best is tasteless, but more often has a disgusting flavor. I saw my primary doctor on Oct 7, nine days after getting the vaccine and an X-ray showed I had pneumonia. I was prescribed an antibiotic, a steroid, an inhaler, and a cough suppressant. I spent the night of 10/14/21, 16 days after getting the vaccine, in the ER because I felt like I couldn't breathe and had absolutely no energy. An x-ray was taken and showed the pneumonia was gone, but I had Acute Bronchitis. I was intravenously given 2 bags of saline solution and potassium for dehydration, even though I drink plenty of water. I also got a breathing treatment. I was prescribed another steroid.

The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient's past medical history included: acute onychomadesis, middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident, and intertrochanteric fracture of right femur closed initial encounter, and concurrent conditions included: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, atherosclerosis of native artery of both lower extremities with intermittent claudication, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure with hypoxia, and vascular dementia, and patient had no known drug allergies. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 041A21A, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 18-JUN-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, amlodipine besilate, atorvastatin calcium, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metformin, and omeprazole. On 20-AUG-2021, the patient was tested positive for covid-19 (sars-cov-2 test positive) and experienced confirmed clinical vaccination failure, after an exposure at nursing facility. On 25-AUG-2021, the patient was admitted to the orthopedic service for right comminuted hip fracture (femur fracture) that occurred after a fall at his living facility. At the time of hospitalization, patient was fairly asymptomatic from covid- 19 infection. Patient was initially stable with no significant chest x-ray findings (normal results). Patient was scheduled for operating room on 26-AUG-2021, but overnight, on 25-AUG-2021, patient had rapid escalation in his oxygen needs going from room air to requiring 5-6 liters nasal cannula (oxygen saturation decreased) and later to high-flow nasal cannula. It was unable to obtain computed tomography angiography thorax due to patient's kidney function (renal impairment), so, computed tomography thorax without contrast performed only showed severe emphysema. Ventilation perfusion (VQ) scan was obtained which was not suspicious for pulmonary embolism. Patient was started on a heparin drip (anticoagulant therapy) due to concern for pulmonary embolism versus fat embolism. As VQ scan came back negative for pulmonary embolism, heparin drip was discontinued. After that, orthopedic team transferred service to hospitalist team and was waiting for improvement in respiratory status before proceeding with surgery. On 25-AUG-2021, patient experienced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patient was then started on decadron (dexamethasone). As patient's oxygen requirements increased (condition aggravated), he was placed on continuous (bilevel) positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to help with workup breathing. Code status was confirmed with patient's son and he wanted patient to remain as and not to resuscitate. Patient was made incapacitated at nursing facility. Due to worsening oxygen requirements, pulmonology was also consulted. Patient was continued on BiPAP with worsening respiratory status (respiratory failure) and eventually died. On 30-AUG-2021, the patient died from covid-19. Patient was hospitalized for 6 days. It was unspecified if an autopsy was performed. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient died of death, respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, femur fracture, hip fracture, renal impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, sars-cov-2 test positive, condition aggravated, oxygen saturation decreased, anticoagulant therapy, fall, bilevel positive airway pressure, chest x-ray normal, computerised tomogram thorax abnormal and ventilation perfusion scan normal on 30-AUG-2021, and the outcome of confirmed clinical vaccination failure was not reported.

The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient's past medical history included Blepharoplasty, and physical deconditioning. Concurrent conditions included Dementia, carotid artery narrowing, right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism acquired benign essential hypertension, tension headache, dizziness - light-headed, cerebrovascular accident, erectile dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage iii, depression, anxiety, seasonal allergic rhinitis due to other allergic trigger, and sulfa drug allergy. The patient experienced myalgia when treated with atorvastatin calcium, and pravastatin and nausea when treated with sulfa drugs. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, administered 1 in total on 05-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, amlodipine besilate, ascorbic acid, calcium/cholecalciferol, camphor, and menthol/methyl salicylate. The patient was initially hospitalized from 11-APR-2021 to 15-April-2021 for physical deconditioning. During that time the patient was diagnosed with dementia with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 6.30. The patient was discharged to rehabilitation where he undergone rehabilitation. On 22-AUG-2021, the patient presented to the emergency department in extremis. The patient was in profound respiratory distress and shock (septic shock), believed to be secondary to covid-19 and possible bacterial pneumonia as well as new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was tested positive for covid (suspected clinical vaccination failure) at his care facility a couple days prior. It was unclear, if he had been undergoing any kind of treatment for the same. He had significant episodes of non-responsiveness and apnea while the patient was in the emergency department. Additionally, the patient was profoundly hypotensive and tachycardia with new onset rapid atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response. The patient was hypothermic and placed on a Bair Hugger. The Patient was started on intravenous fluid and placed on phenylephrine infusion. Conversation with the patient's attender revealed that the patient would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or to be placed on a ventilator (dependence on respirator) but they would want to pursue all other aggressive measures. The patient was then transitioned to the emergency department intensive care unit for further management. After arrival to the intensive care unit the patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated (resuscitation). His blood pressures responded relatively well. Due to pharmacy shortage of the phenylephrine the patient was transitioned to Levophed (norepinephrine) as well as amiodarone infusion. His cognitive status drastically improved from that of the emergency department. The patient was alert and oriented. Initial blood work revealed mild electrolyte abnormalities (Electrolyte imbalance), lactic acid greater than 7, creatinine of 1.9. Suspicious for ongoing covid infection and possible pneumonia the patient's antibiotics were transitioned to cefepime, azithromycin and vancomycin. The patient was started on Remdesivir for covid 19 treatment. Arterial blood gas revealed compensated metabolic acidosis. The patient's lactic acid has improved to 6.5 from 7. Initial troponins were elevated as expected, demanded ischemia from septic shock. Electrocardiogram did not reveal any ST segment changes. The patient did not complain of any chest pain; however, the patient was however complaining of abdominal pain. The patient had a soft right inguinal hernia which was difficult to reduce and had no overlying skin changes. The patient desired aggressive treatment and went forward knowing the high risk of death. On 22-AUG-2021, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and was found to have a prepyloric perforation (gastrointestinal fistula) and peritonitis. The patient was intubated along with central line placements. Aggressive treatment continued and patient was extubated. Chest x-ray revealed mild scattered interstitial thickening and lung opacities. Further workup revealed a pneumoperitoneum. The patient had an increasing oxygen demand. Initially he required 6 liter of oxygen in the emergency department and then 100 percent oxygen (oxygen saturation increased) via non-rebreather. At approximately 16:30 while re-evaluating the patient went into a wide complex ventricular tachycardia with an initial heart rate of approximately 240. The patient was not feeling well, his Levophed was shut off and fluids were started. A stat amiodarone infusion of 150 mg was begun. The patient was connected to defibrillator pads. His heart rate responded to the amiodarone infusion, however he subsequently entered into a narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate of approximately 180. His blood pressure remained stable during this time. As continued to monitor in supportive care and continued his amiodarone infusion the patient's heart rate then entered into a normal sinus rhythm with a systolic rate of approximately 90. Unfortunately strips of these rhythms were unable to be captured. Electrocardiography afterwards revealed normal sinus rhythm with a first-degree heart block and previously seen right bundle-branch block. After his amiodarone infusion, no bolus was started or further infusion and continued monitoring Stat. Computed tomography of chest, abdomen and pelvis was obtained. This revealed many things but specifically a pneumoperitoneum. The case was discussed with the on-call general surgeon who evaluated the patient in the intensive care unit. It was decided the patient wanted to pursue aggressive measures including exploratory laparotomy. Risks of surgery including death were shared with the patient. Furthermore, was explicitly stated that he would likely return to the intensive care unit ventilator, dependent with multiple drains and need for central line, continued resuscitation the ultimate outcome of which being still high likelihood of death. Understanding this, the patient and his son still wanted to proceed. Alternatives including comfort care were offered and declined. Of additional findings on computed tomography scan included nodular pulmonary opacities, right with left pleural effusion, small abdominal aortic aneurysm and mild pulmonary fibrosis. On 25-AUG-2021, further findings and repeated computed tomography scans were done, which showed continued leaking from stomach as well as potential cancerous brain mass. On 26-AUG-2021, along with son the family agreed on comfort care initiation. On 28-AUG-2021, the patient died from covid-19 positive/covid-19 virus infection. The patient's discharge diagnosis included perforated gastric ulcer (gastric ulcer perforation), acute blood loss anemia, covid-19, acute kidney injury with chronic kidney disease stage III, acute metabolic encephalopathy.

Sunday 1/24/21 - 12 hours after 2nd shot, severe flu symptoms for the next 12 hours. Chills, joint pain, headache, fatigue, intense sensitivity to sound. Monday 1/25/21 got up, feeling fine, showered, noticed small lump in R axilla/breast region. I went to work and by noon, I asked my co-worker to look at my neck.  He rushed me down the hall to the ER.  I had severe lymphadenopathy in my R anterior neck and R axilla.  Both the ER nurse and doctor took a step backwards and said they had never seen anything like it. I called employee health and the response was that I should be happy that my body has had such a strong reaction and the symptom is on the side effects list. I got sent home. Tuesday 1/26/21. I had a pre-scheduled mammogram.  I didn?t think they would perform the mammogram, but I thought maybe the radiologist would see me and give me advice, i.e. heat/cold, NSAIDs, compression, something.  They sent me home. Wednesday 1/27/21 - I returned to work. The symptoms remained.  I was very uncomfortable and unable to wear a bra. I wore layered tank tops under my work polo. Thursday 1/28/21. I reached out to a friend of mine who is a transplant surgeon.  She called Infectious Diseases and they said the symptoms could last up to 1 month. I called employee health again and they said, ?I should be tickled, that I have had such a robust response. March rolls around and I still have severe lymphadenopathy. My transplant surgeon friend suggests I get my bloodwork done.  All bloodwork came back normal with no changes from when I had it taken October 2020. This entire time, I've also had moderate fatigue. I could work, but that was it. I would go to bed when I got home. July I get a PT script for lymphatic drainage massage. My PT measured a 3 difference from L to R. A month later it was down to �.

They did a Catheterization on my heart and 2 other tests, and prescribed Eliquis. On Monday I came home. On Wednesday I went back to the hospital and came home on Thursday afternoon.

Since I had had back to back flu symptoms as a 'reaction' to the flu shot 20 years ago, I doubted I had the flu because it did not feel the same.  Dr. had told me that now they were going to have to test for both C-19 & flu as the symptoms are similar.  Anyway, I messaged Dr. did she think I needed a C-19 test? One was scheduled for the next day. Got the results 2 days later.  Negative.  I also was having mental issues: racing thoughts, unable to make decisions, extremely short term memory, trouble figuring out how to drive places and could no longer do Sudoku--even the easiest  when I had been able almost always finish all levels.  I slowly got better physically. However the mental aspects have been even slower to get better. It appears that I'm not going to get back to how I was b4 that flu vaccine.

Hospitalized. per ED Note: Patient is a 50-year-old female with past medical history multiple sclerosis presenting to the emergency department chief complaint of generalized weakness. The patient states he has had generalized weakness over the past 4-5 6 days and she has had frequent falls. She uses a wheelchair to get around her home and states that she has been self catheterizing herself for urine over the past 20 years. She states over the past 4 to 5 days she has felt so generally weak that she has fallen multiple times while trying to transfer from her wheelchair to the toilet. The patient otherwise complains of bilateral upper foot pain. She denies fever, chills, chest pain, shortness breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, numbness, loss of coordination. Initial MDM: 50-year-old female presents the emergency department complaining of generalized weakness. Patient has fallen multiple times. She is on blood thinners. She did not hit her head that she can remember. Did not lose consciousness. Physical exam is as above. Vital signs within normal limits outside of mild hypertension. Will order bilateral foot x-rays, chest x-ray, EKG, labs   Was seen and evaluated by myself and my attending supervisor Dr.   Radiology imaging, EKG/Rhythm strip, and lab work (if obtained) were reviewed and interpreted by myself and my attending physician unless otherwise noted below. These were interpreted as normal or not significant to current complaint unless otherwise noted below.  CBC unremarkable, urinalysis consistent with mild urinary tract infection, BMP unremarkable, total CK within normal limits, TSH within normal limits.   CT head without contrast shows no acute intracranial abnormality  1 view chest x-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary disease  Bilateral foot x-ray shows no fracture   EKG interpreted by myself and my attending physician: 10/21/2021, 1302, rate 72 beats minute, normal sinus rhythm, intervals within normal limits, normal axis, no significant ST elevation or depression, no significant T wave changes Course/Re-evaluation:   patient is unable to perform activities of daily living without difficulty at home and states that she has stabbing difficulties transferring from wheelchair to toilet without falling. The patient agrees to staying in the clinical decision unit for observation for neurology as well as PT/OT/social work evaluation. Per CDU Note: Pulse oximeter noted to be of good saturation at 100% on room air.  Twelve-lead EKG noted to reveal a normal sinus rhythm rate of 72 bpm there is no evidence of acute ST-T wave changes noted with a normal PR interval.  Laboratory testing did reveal a normal white blood cell count of 6760 with a stable hemoglobin of 12.3 the urine analysis appeared to be contaminated.  The chemistries were unremarkable.  Chest x-ray, x-ray of both feet and CT scan of the brain were all noted by the radiologist to reveal no acute finding.  The Covid screen was noted to be positive.   Spoke with Dr. covering another Dr. Case was discussed and plan is to admit the patient to her service.  Nursing asked me to go back to the bedside.  The patient indicated that she does not want to be admitted.  I did reaffirm that she had COVID-19.  And that could very well be contributing to her general weakness.  She states that the weakness is from her multiple sclerosis and does not think COVID-19 has anything to do with it.  I did tell her at this point in time that if she chooses to be discharged we will discharge her.  However if she changes her mind she may return at any time.  I also told her to isolate herself from other people for the next 10 to 14 days.

1815190,10/25/2021,MD,47.0,47,,M,,"Encephalomyelitis: May 17th, 3 weeks after receiving his Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine, when he developed two areas of back pain in his mid-scapular and lower back region that felt like typical back pain for him. By late May, he had developed a banding sensation around his abdomen from his lower ribs to just below his umbilicus. He was seen in the ED where serum Lyme serologies were sent and returned positive, so he was started on a 21 day course of doxycycline. However, his symptoms continued to worsen until he developed photosensitivity and sudden horizontal binocular diplopia on June 9th. He was initially evaluated at Hospital, had an LP which reportedly showed elevated WBCs and elevated protein, and was transitioned to ceftriaxone x 28 days. Approximately 1 to 1.5 weeks into this treatment, his double vision resolved.   However, in early July, patient noticed he was having numbness in his feet, especially his left foot. 2 weeks after ceftriaxone: trouble with walking. This worsened and then became associated with imbalance. He also had worsening of the banding sensation and developed intermittent episodes of fecal incontinence, urinary incontinence, urinary hesitancy, and urinary urgency. More recently his numbness in his legs has worsened, and he has developed numbness in his fingertips bilaterally and Lhermitte's phenomenon when he flexes his head. He had an MRI done at an outside facility yesterday which was concerning for transverse myelitis, so his outpatient neurologist referred him to the ED for further evaluation.     He was admitted to the Neurology Service on 7/22/2021 and discharged on 7/27/2021. Initially on exam, mental status, language, and cranial nerves were normal. Motor exam was notable only for hip flexors 4/5 bilaterally. Reflexes were 3+ in the bilateral upper extremities and bilateral lower extremities. Hoffman's was negative bilaterally but crossed-adductor spread was present bilaterally. Toes were upgoing bilaterally. On sensory exam, there was decreased cold sensation to the proximal forearms bilaterally and in the left lower extremity to above the knee. Temperature sensation was normal in the right lower extremity. Vibration was absent at the left great toe, 1-2 seconds at the right great toe, and 4-6 seconds at the ankles and knees bilaterally. Gait was wide-based and ataxic.    MRI brain was unremarkable. MRI C-spine showed two longitudinally extensive lesions in the high cervical and lower cervical/upper thoracic region with patchy enhancement and some edema of the cord, which was concerning for transverse myelitis of inflammatory or infectious etiology, such as post-vaccination myelitis vs primary autoimmune/demyelinating disorder. Serum AQP4 and MOG Abs were negative. CSF was notable for WBC [9,5], RBC 0, glucose 71, protein 75.8, IgG 5.47, and albumin 62.9. There were no oligoclonal IgG bands present in CSF or corresponding serum sample. CSF VZV, HSV, EBV, and bacterial culture were negative, with CSF T.pallidum VDRL Ab, lyme Ab, and fungal culture resulted NEGATIVE Myelopathy labs, including ceruloplasmin, copper, VitB12, MMA, homocysteine, ESR, CRP, ANA, other than Zinc which was mildly low at 52.   He was started on IV MP 1000 mg (course 5 days), improvement noted after first dose. Lyrica 75mg BID was started due to abdominal pain, that is possibly neuropathic. He has been improving since and will need follow up outpatient. After 4 doses of the IV steroid form, it was determined that he has significantly improved, and would be safe to complete his 5th dose in oral form at home, followed by a steroid taper over 6 weeks, starting with prednisone 60mg, with a decrease in increments of 10mg per week.  - After discharge he used the walker for balance during 3 weeks. Right now walks independently.  - He reports he is 90% of his baseline: continues to have numbness, the balance is not great, although he denies falls. More recently he has developed a  Lhermitte's: upon bending his neck he reports shock like sensation down his spine and arms.  - Bladder function is also improving, no urgency or incontinence anymore. Bowels are ok as well.  - While decreasing the dose of steroids, symptoms have remained stable.  -No current plan of PT.    The plan was to update the MRIs, repeat both AQP4/MOG testing and Adenovirus antibodies.    We reviewed Spinal MRI 09/2021: at that time the Lhermitte's was still present, the banding sensation in his knees and balance continued to be unchanged, but overall he felt better. Complete spine MRI still displayed multiple areas of enhancement although decreased since last MRI in 07/2021.  Prednisone: finished 09/09/2021. We decided to order a second round of high steroids (IVMP) and continue prednisone 50mg after that: taper 10mg /week. Infusion was started on 09/22/2021. -- 09/27/2021 followed by a 10mg/week taper.

He is being admitted to the Hospital. He has medical comorbidities including, but not limited to, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LV ejection fraction 30%, bradycardia/complete heart block status post ICD, atrial fibrillation/flutter on Eliquis, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, minimal coronary artery disease by angiogram 2011, medically complicated obesity, and history of clostridium difficile causing hypovolemic shock.     Today patient was taking a shower and experienced a syncopal episode with complete loss of consciousness and awoke to find that he had sustained a right ankle injury.  He denied other injury, but is anticoagulated.  In the ED he was hemodynamically stable and conversant with an obvious deformity to the right ankle.  Bedside interrogation of pacemaker/ICD revealed two episodes of ventricular tachydysrhythmia within the past 24 hours, one corresponding to his syncopal event during which he received appropriate antitachycardia discharge.  Available EGM appears to show VT at a rate of 185-210 bpm, rate eventually sustained long enough for device to start therapies.  Device delivered (1) unsuccessful ATP and then a 41J shock with a type I break.  Device also reported 6 VT episodes that occurred on 10-23-21 between the times of 3:27am to 4:20.  Ventricular rates ranged between 171-183 bpm which were under detection therapy rate.  Longest episode was 31 seconds which appears to show no conversion of VT but just going below monitor zone of 171 bpm. Dr. was notified and  VT-1 zone was programmed at 160 bpm with ATP and shocks at max outputs. Monitor zone was programmed at 140 bpm.    Radiographs of the right ankle demonstrated a fracture dislocation of the tibiotalar joint with lateral dislocation of the talus relative to the tibial plafond with frank diastasis of the tibiofibular syndesmosis. Ortho was consulted in the ED and he was placed in a plaster splint, his leg should be elevated above the level of the heart for 23 out of 24 hours each day to assist with reduction of swelling and preparation of the soft tissues for surgical intervention.  He will be contacted by ortho with a cast room appointment in 1-2 weeks and should arrive at that appointment fasting in order to be prepared for surgery if indicated.  Strict nonweightbearing on the injured extremity   Upon arrival to the PCU, patient is resting comfortably in bed, denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Reports a cold with congestion that began last Monday, Wednesday was the worst day and since then has improved.  He has been taking Mucinex DM (guaifenesin and dextromethorphan).  Denies any fevers.

I was on steroids for about four to five months. I was also having swelling and pains in my hands and wrists to the point that I couldn't hardly use them.

Both my Pfizer doses severely exacerbated my long covid/FND symptoms and created new setbacks in my disabilities.   Pfizer #1: Severe symptoms for 6 days with new onset of constant, mild ringing ears that I still experience. Worse nausea, fatigue, and headache for 4-5 days. Worse functional arm/hand tremor, functional gait, injection site pain, and diarrhea for 3 days. Chills and a sense of warm postnasal drip for 2 days.  Pfizer #2: Severe symptoms for 15 days, many of my FND symptoms still not back to baseline. Ringing ears became slightly louder after second dose. Worse functionalhand/arm tremor, functional gait, ringing ears, and diarrhea for 15+ days. Worse fatigue for 8 days. Worse headache for 7 days. Worse nausea for 5 days. Worse injection site pain and body aches for 5 days. Chills for 3 days and feverish for 2 days. I messaged my neurologist about the worse FND symptoms following COVID vaccinations but we did not take further action as FND can naturally have ups and downs. I do not think the COVID vaccine itself made me sicker, but I think there may be an interesting relationship between my previous contraction of COVID-19 in early 2020, my reactivity to COVID and development of Long Covid, the triggering of my FND, and the possibility that the COVID vaccine ellicits severe symptoms in me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient has a significant past medical history of COPD (maintained on p.r.n. albuterol nebulizers with no baseline supplemental oxygen) along with chronic heart failure (EF 34% in 2019 maintained on spironolactone, Lasix, and losartan) in the setting of ischemic heart disease (12 stents), atrial fibrillation on chronic amiodarone and aspirin (previously declined anticoagulation) with pacer/defibrillator (since 2009), chronic lymphocytic leukemia with baseline anemia requiring intermittent red blood cell infusions and chronic thrombocytopenia, chronic stage IIIB kidney disease, nicotine dependence, hypothyroidism, GERD, chronic back pain, and mild cognitive impairment. Patient is confused and not able to convey an accurate history.  I spoke to a family member by phone to confirm the details of the history.  She reports she was up all night with him because he was so short of breath.  At one point he went to the bathroom when she dozed off and fell as he was walking to the bathroom onto his right side hitting the rocking chair.  He had told me he fell getting out of the car. She said he was in the car yesterday when they went for the antibody infusion but did not fall, and that she no longer lets him drive due to his confusion.  She describes his mental status as currently at baseline.  She says he has been SOB and has had a non-productive cough but doesn't know if he has had any fevers.  He has had the right-sided chest pain since the fall but not previous. He was first COVID-19 PCR + on 10/21/21 and received outpatient monoclonal antibody (Casirivimab-Imdevimab) infusion on 10/22/21.  He did receive Pfizer dose 1 and 2 in Feb/March but has not received a booster.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED ON 11/OCT/2021: This follow up information involves a patient who involves a patient whose symptoms were worsening/sometimes really aches in his ankles, knees, and shoulders [PT: rheumatoid arthritis] while receiving Enbrel, Multiple Dose Vial Kit For Reconstitution, Single Dose Prefilled Syringe. Previously reported event PT: intentional product misuse was updated to off label use. The patient's concomitant medication included COVID-19 vaccine. The patient began Enbrel on an unknown date in 2001 (20 years ago). On an unknown date, the patient switched from Multiple Dose Vial to Prefilled Syringe and felt like after switching his symptoms were worsening. Just like the Multiple Dose Vial was better, he believed it worked better. The patient was wondering if the pharmacy was handling the medication correctly and maintained product at the correct temperature range. The patient already spoke with them and they assure him they were handling the medication correctly. For many years he had no symptoms at all so his rheumatologist at the time changed his prescription to once every two weeks and at one point to once every eight weeks which was an off label use. The patient was informed since Enbrel worked for him it would work for him forever. In JAN/2021, the patient received both COVID-19 vaccine and that over the past few months when his symptoms really got bad. The patient just aches all over but sometimes really aches in his ankles, knees, and shoulders. The patient had problems with his right foot aching and some swelling which were the same symptoms he had when he was first put on Enbrel. Two months ago in AUG/2021, the symptoms got so bad he went to his physician and was given a corticoid steroid injection which helped him for a month. The patient stated that now two Advil (ibuprofen) worked better than a shot of Enbrel. The patient was now referred to a new rheumatologist. The worsening of symptoms could be related to something else possibly even the COVID-19 vaccine but felt like he did just fine until he was switched to the Prefilled Syringe and was wondering if there was a difference between the two formulations. Action taken with Single Dose Prefilled Syringe was reported as unknown for the event rheumatoid arthritis. The causal relationship between the events intentional dose omission, rheumatoid arthritis, and ingle Dose Prefilled Syringe was not provided by the consumer. No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.  Amgen comments: This individual case report does not change the safety profile of the product.   Amgen's Causality Assessment: The events Intentionally missed dose, Rheumatoid arthritis aggravated, and Off label dosing frequency were assessed as unrelated to etanercept.

Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.; Sender's Comments: The event rheumatoid arthritis aggravated, confounded by the reported inappropriate schedule of product administration and intentional misuse in dosing frequency,  is unrelated to etanercept and likely represents the natural course of underlying disease.

However, cheese and less does not affect patient.), Obesity and Pain. Concomitant products included PARACETAMOL (TYLENOL) for Pain.    On 09-May-2021 at 11:00 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-May-2021, the patient experienced PALPITATIONS (Irregular heart rate/palpitations/her heart was pounding) and FEELING ABNORMAL (the patient felt really weird when the first shot was injected into her for about 40 minutes). 09-May-2021, the patient experienced BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED (Drop in blood Pressure). In May 2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (the patient felt some pain around the injection site). On 02-Jun-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), CHEST DISCOMFORT (Chest tightness), FEELING HOT (Feeling hot), FLUSHING (Flushing) and PARAESTHESIA (Prickling/Tingling). On 03-Jun-2021, the patient experienced APPENDICITIS (Appendicitis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). In June 2021, the patient experienced PRESYNCOPE (almost passed out) and TINNITUS (ears were ringing). On an unknown date, the patient experienced DIZZINESS (felt faint) and HEADACHE (bit of a headache). The patient was hospitalized on sometime in June 2021 due to APPENDICITIS. The patient was treated with Surgery (Apendicectomy) for Appendicitis. On 09-May-2021, BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED (Drop in blood Pressure) had resolved.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-May-2021, Blood pressure measurement: drop (Low) Drop in Blood Pressure. On an unknown date, Blood pressure measurement: little low (Low) little low.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing remained unchanged.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered APPENDICITIS (Appendicitis) and BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED (Drop in blood Pressure) to be possibly related.

Treatment information was not provided. The patient's body felt like it was going into red alert mode; like it did not like what was in the shot.  She felt faint, so the pharmacist took her blood pressure (which was usually on the higher side, because of her weight) and it was super low. Again after 15 minutes, bp was checked. It was a little low, but it was okay for her to go home. She felt some pain around the injection site for the next few days and had a bit of a headache, but that was it. When the patient was taking a shower on 02-Jun-2021, her right lower abdomen started hurting bad. Then that night when she got up to use the bathroom, it hurt so bad that her ears were ringing, and she almost passed out. The morning of 03-Jun-2021, her husband took her to the emergency room, and she was informed that she had appendicitis and it was needed to perform emergency surgery to remove it.

A day after receiving the vaccine, he started having body aches and headaches. Later, his headache improved, but he progressively developed shortness of breath. He presented to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath and denied cough, fever, chest pain or palpitations, trouble with urination, and bowel movements. His hepatic function panel and renal function panel were within normal limits. At the time of admission, laboratory parameters were normal for the most part. He was initially treated with intravenous steroids, oxygen supplements, and intravenous remdesivir. When there was no clinical improvement over the next 48 hours, he was started on combination of oral baricitinib and remdesivir as this combination was proven superior to remdesivir alone in the length of stay of hospitalized patients from COVID-19. There was still no improvement after 72 hours, and two doses of tocilizumab were administered. However, he continued to deteriorate with progressive hypoxia, requiring up to 15 L oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula. Convalescent plasma was routinely administered to COVID-19 patients during that period. After much debate, it was decided not to administer convalescent plasma. Over the next 2 days, his hypoxia worsened, and the imaging showed a new pneumo- mediastinum. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit for further management and completed the ten-day course of IV remdesivir therapy. He was also given intermittent diuretics, high-dose IV steroids. His liver enzymes, renal function panel, and inflammatory markers were within normal limits. He was eventually transferred back to the medical floor and discharged home with one-liter supplemental oxygen.

In the context of COVID19 crisis, the batch number and expiration date were not requested. Therapy date: 2017 to 2017. Dupilumab was not used for the first time.

It was reported Consumer states that he has been on Dupixent almost 4 years. I had my first Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 11Jan2021. I had my second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine dose on 01Feb2021. My wife had it (Covld-19 vaccines) done the same time. Sunday we were at a wedding. Then we were notified that there was a Covid outbreak, and my wife and I got tested for Covid. I was negative and my wife was negative. Then we got instructions from our doc-tor to get the antibody test. My wife's antibody test was 18 and I have no antibodies for the Covid vaccine. So, I am wondering if I should be getting a booster shot or does DUPIXENT kill the effects of the vaccine because it stops the inflammation. I am taking DUPIXENT for dermatitis, but I think it also works for asthma because I have not had one asthma attack in this period of almost four years that I have been taking DUPIXENT. And I no longer take any asthma medication and it has cleared up my skin. So, it is working for both. So, I am wondering if DUPIXENT caused me not to have anti-bodies to the vaccine and if I am protected against Covid. My job Is that I am an x-ray technician and I take care of patients every day. I think the starter dose was 600 mg and I take 300 mg. I am using it (DUPIXENT) every 20 days. I think it was prescribed for every 14 days. I went out to 30 (every 30 days) but then my rash came back. So, now I am using it (DUPIXENT) every 20 or 21 days and It is controlling my dermatitis. That is how I am using it now. No, I do not have the lot number and expiration date. I am at work now. My doctor is with the Hospital. The lot number for my first Pfizer Covld-19 vaccine of 0.3 mL on 11Jan2021 was EK9231. The lot number for my second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine of 0.3 mL on 01Feb2021 was E then L or K then 9265 (EL9265 or EK9265). I had called Sandi before because I was having tingling in my fingers and toes and my doctor told me to do that. So, there is correspondence back and forth on that. That was back in Apr2019. I still have that tingling in my fingers and toes but that may be from my age or It may be from this (DUPIXENT). I am slit taking the drug (DUPIXENT). Consumer wants to know is this because of DUPIXENT that stops inflammation could killed the effect of the Covid-19 vaccine. Also wants to know should he get a booster vaccine.

Here is a case of severe COVID-19 infection in a patient with malignant lymphoma who completed the vaccination course.CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old male with malignant lymphoma on active Rituximab was diagnosed with COVID-19 two months after completing the Pfizer vaccination course. He presented with a worsening cough despite receiving monoclonal antibodies outpatient. On evaluation, his vitals were stable. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities. During his hospitalization, he received a full course of dexamethasone, ivermectin, remdesivir and baricitinib. However, his cough and oxygenation progressively worsened, with eventual intubation and vasopressor support. Computed Tomography (CT) Chest showed progressive worsening of COVID-19 Pneumonia. Originally on admission he had tested negative for the IgM and IgG antibodies against the Nucleocapsid (N) Protein which raised the suspicion that he had not mounted an immune response to the vaccine. On further evaluation, he was found to have positive antibody titers against Spike (S) proteins which confirmed that he had mounted a response to the vaccine despite his imnmunocompromised status. DISCUSSION: Anti-CD20 therapy is one of the primary therapies for hematological malignancies. Despite T cell function being the primary role against COVID-19, there is increasing evidence that B-cell depletion may inhibit protective immunity following infection and vaccination. A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 (Pfizer) conferred 95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years of age or older, and decreased the rate of severe infection. However, only 4% of the vaccinated patients suffered from any malignancy; 0.2% of them had metastatic solid tumors, leukemia, lymphoma and none were on chemotherapy. The efficacy of the vaccine was extrapolated to include the subset of individuals on active chemotherapy. Interestingly, despite having an active immunological response to the vaccine and normal T-cell function, the patient suffered from severe COVID pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Though widespread immunization against COVID-19 is underway, patients with hematological malignancies still remain a vulnerable population. The decision to halt immunomodulatory therapy to improve efficacy of the vaccine needs further investigation.; Sender's Comments: Efficacy of the vaccine varies from patient to patient. However, a contributory role of the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events vaccination failure and COVID-19  (two months after completing the Pfizer vaccination course) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,,,,,,,U,,,,Test Name: IgG antibodies; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: IgM antibodies; Test Result: Negative  ; Test Name: Chest x-ray; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:revealed bilateral pleural effusions with; Comments: bibasilar opacities.; Test Name: Computed Tomography (CT) Chest; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:showed progressive worsening of COVID-19 Pneumonia; Test Name: COVID-19; Test Result: Positive,UNK,,,Malignant lymphoma (on active Rituximab),,,USPFIZER INC202101381603,2,10/25/2021,,,,

A patient of unspecified age and gender received pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (diphtheria crm197 protein) (PREVENAR 13), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: DR1779; Expiration Date: Feb2023) as dose number unknown, single for immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that the neck of the vaccine snapped; defective vaccine. The patient stated, ""One of the necks, the glass neck on one of the Prevnar 13 snapped. The nurse connected a lower lock needle under the lower lock and when she went to put cover off the needle the neck of your vaccine snapped.  Investigation result from Product Quality Group: Description of Complaint:  Complaint Issue: Broken at the neck (Lot: DR1779; Batch Expiry: Feb2023). Reasonably Suggest Device Malfunction: Yes; Severity of Harm: S1. Summary of Investigation: The initial scope of the investigation is limited to the lots documented in the related lots grid.  The findings of the investigation are as follows; Batch /Process Record Review: No Findings in relation to the reported complaint. Reserve Sample Evaluation: No defects were observed related to the reported complaint. Complaint Sample Evaluation: The sample was evaluated at Pfizer and did confirm the reported complaint. Trend/Complaint History: A lot specific trend was not identified For the Fill Lot and associated syringe barrel lots. The final scope was limited to the  Fill Lot (refer to related lots grid) as no evidence was found to indicate that manufacturing activities contributed to the reported complaint. Root Cause Analysis/Identif: No evidence was found to indicate that manufacturing activities at Withheld contributed to the reported complaint. The returned sample confirmed the reported defect. Note: The most likely root cause is attributed to the failure of the glass due to residual thermal stress resulting from the syringe manufacturing process when the tips were formed, and stress was introduced as the glass cooled. Such stress is inherent to the forming process, and while subsequent annealing should mitigate this stress, it may remain present at low levels. Following investigation, no evidence was found to indicate that manufacturing activities contributed to the defect reported in this complaint. All reviewed records for the involved batch indicated that the batch met the established requirements at time of release Impact Analysis: Following review of the investigation results based on the final scope, there is no evidence that manufacturing activities contributed to the reported complaint. A lot specific trend was not identified. The reported complaint is not representative of the quality of the batch and the batch remains acceptable. Breakages of this type (broken at the tip) are catastrophic and render the syringe unusable. Consequently, the actual impact to the patient is limited to a delayed dose (S1). Corrective/Preventive Action: Following investigation, no evidence was found to indicate that manufacturing activities contributed to the reported complaint, therefore no corrective and preventative actions were identified. Complaint Sample Evaluation:(Parent) Sample_Status: Sample Availability Unknown. Site Sample Status: Not Received; Return Sample Evaluation One syringe received. No defects found on label. There was only dried up suspension inside the syringe. The rubber tip cap was missing, the needle was present, the rubber plunger was in position after ejecting part of a dose and the plunger rod was firmly attached. The tip of the syringe was broken off and inside the needle hub. There was dried up suspension at the inside of the barrel. Confirmed Complaint Sample Defect?: Yes. Impact assessment: No related quality issues were identified during the investigation. There is no impact on product quality, regulatory, validation, stability and patient safety. Withheld concludes that the reported defect is not representative of the quality of the batch and the batch remains acceptable. Corrective / Preventive Action: No corrective or preventive actions were identified as all reviewed records for the involved batch indicated that the batch met the established requirements at time of release. Conclusion: The complaint for ""glass neck snapped"" of Prevnar 13V Injectable was investigated. The investigation included reviewing the involved batch records, deviation investigation, complaint sample, evaluation of retain sample(s), an analysis of the complaint history for the reported lot and product type and Annual Product (Quality) Review. The final scope was determined to be the associated lot(s) of the reported lot DR1779. The reported defect was present on the returned complaint sample. No related quality issues were identified during the investigation. There is no impact on product quality, regulatory, validation, stability and patient safety. Site concludes that the reported defect is not representative of the quality of the batch and the batch remains acceptable. The NTM process determined that a regulatory notification (BPDR) was required. The reported defect could be confirmed on the returned complaint sample. No root cause or CAPA were identified as all reviewed records for the involved batch indicated that the batch met the established requirements at time of release.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

1817863,10/26/2021,GA,83.0,83,,F,,"On Wednesday, August 25th, 2021 my mother awoke and assumed her normal daily routine. She had a breakfast of one egg, two slices of bacon and wheat toast. She was perfectly ambulatory and needed no help in walking, dressing, her personal hygiene or assistance in going to the restroom. At 12:30 that afternoon she walked down the stairs of her home and she and I left for her COVID vaccination at the local store. We arrived at store and immediately went to the pharmacy department where she received the Moderna vaccination.  We continued shopping for grocery items for an additional 15-20 minutes, paid our bill and exited the store. As we were leaving the store she complained of soreness in her vaccinated arm and a feeling of weakness. I had to help her into our vehicle and upon arriving home had to physically carry her up the steps and into the house. I put her onto the couch where she could relax and watch television. She was alert and mentally clear but extremely weak. I researched reactions to the vaccination on line and attributed her initial weakened condition as normal reaction to the vaccination and that they could last 1-3 days with minor continuing symptoms for as long as two weeks. She continually worsened for the next three days and her mental state continually degenerated to where she seemed unaware of her surroundings and had difficulty responding to verbal stimuli. She could not walk, dress, bathe herself, lost control of her bowels and could not eat without assistance. I contacted my sister and she came over to help me care for her in regards to personal hygiene, feeding, dressing and putting her into and changing of adult diapers. After three days passed with her showing no signs of improvement, I reached out to her primary care physician and left a detailed message of her symptoms with the messaging service of what was happening and asked for advice. I was informed that it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to monitor her for any worsening signs.     On 17 September with her health showing no signs of improving we called 911 for emergency care and had her transported to hospital. A full battery of tests were performed including a CAT scan with no indications of what was causing this digression in her health. The staff stated she was exhibiting signs of dementia which we refute. Her last complete physical dated Feb 05, 2021 indicates her mental and Neurological state at baseline and her Psychiatric state as normal. She was discharged from hospital on Sept 22, 2021 and was transported home where she remained under family care pending assistance from local elderly programs. On Sept, 29th 2021 she was reclining in her armchair when she slumped over to the side and was unresponsive. 911 was called and paramedics arrived, transported her into the emergency vehicle where she went into cardiac arrest. The emergency response team administered CPR until arrival at hospital where she was pronounced dead.       My mother went from a person able to care for herself with minimum assistance to a person who seemed to be in the last stages of Alzheimer?s disease in a matter of three weeks. She did not suffer from any of the mental or physical problems until immediately after the receiving the Moderna COVID vaccination. At 83 years of age she did have normal health issues associated with someone of her age. She was a colon cancer survivor and had been diagnosed with COPD and was on oxygen but she suffered no medical condition which would have resulted in her rapid decline and subsequent death such as happened immediately following her vaccination. Based on what I personally witnessed following her vaccination, I fully believe that if she had not taken it, that she would be with us still. There has not been enough time allowed or documentation of adverse reactions to the COVID vaccination, especially with the elderly or persons with pre-existing medical conditions.",Y,09/29/2021,,,Y,6,,,N,08/25/2021,08/25/2021,0,"CAT scan at Hospital.

I went to get the prescription filled and noticed that my breathing was even worse. My husband took me back to the local HCF and two minutes after being taken back, there was a cardiac alert for me. They performed the EKG and I had congestive heart failure and a heart attack. I had pericarditis, possible pneumonia, myocarditis and pleural effusion. I was so short of breath, they had me on 10-20 liters of oxygen and it was not helping. They tried to rush me to have a triple bypass surgery, but I declined.

He told me to see my dentist, so I did that last month, in September 2021. I am now getting a night guard and a TMJ specialist and I did. The specialist's concern is that it is a bite issue, due to continued growth and my teeth have shifted out of treatment. Just today (10/26/2021) they shaved down the teeth a little bit to make the bite a little better. The cause of the TMJ is completely unknown at this time. Also, back in July I had some bacterial infection, but I work at a summer camp so who knows about that - It felt like pneumonia. It was hard to breath; I could not go to work and the medic on site at work checked me out. The day of rest did not fix it and my mother who is an RN said it was probably an infection of some kind.

Then I began to notice some very mild chest pain, a mild ache. The ache comes and goes but I am now constantly short of breath and fatigued. My arms ache also and feel tingly (pins and needles) as if they don't have enough blood flow throughout the day.  I also occasionally feel like my heart is pounding and my breathing is purposeful or forced. I have a dry cough but it is rarely noticeable. I made an effort to get plenty of sleep and stay hydrated with no resolve. I cannot take long walks, read aloud for a long period or do much of anything without wanting to sit down and rest.  Since the symptoms have not gone away and seem to even be getting worse, I decided to seek treatment. I went to the Urgent Care on Thursday, Oct. 21. I had blood work and EKG and a chest x-ray. the chest x-ray showed cloudy/ inflammation looking according to the doctor. He prescribed prednisone for the inflammation. Tomorrow is my last dose of prednisone and I can only feel minimal improvement. I plan to go back to the Urgent Care for follow up. I still need to get my 2nd vaccine and have been trying to clear this up and finish medication first.   My persisting symptoms are those of possibly pericarditis or myocarditis. The doctor told me I could get the vaccine even if I tested positive ( I did test negative at the Urgent Care visit). Or even while on Prednisone. I am still waiting to get my second vaccine as prednisone can compromise the immune system and I understand the second vaccine is stronger.",,,,,,,,,N,09/03/2021,09/10/2021,7,"Urgent care has these records from my visit on Oct. 21, 2021",UNK,,"One A Day women's multivitamin.

Patient currently resides at home under the care of her mother/DPOA. Patient was brought into the ED on 10/14 due to concerns of vomiting, cough, and possible blood coming out of her GJ tube.  Mother reported patient's symptoms started a few days prior to presentation. She stated that patient had been coughing and spiking low grade fevers. Mom also reported concerns regarding potential aspiration event at home. Patient is strict NPO with feeding tube in place. Grandson in the home recently tested positive for COVID thus mother was concerned patient may have this as well. Patient is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 however. Additionally mother reported what appeared to be blood coming out of her G tube. It appears patient has had issues with this in the past. Last EGD was noted to be in March of this year and was negative for any source of bleeding at that time. Otherwise mother reported that patient appeared fatigue and less alert/interactive then her baseline.  Upon arrival to the ED, patient was noted to be febrile/tachycardic/hypotensive. She was not hypoxic. Basic labs were obtained and notable for normal WBC, Hg of 8.8 which is patient's baseline, Na-130, AKI with Cr of 1.4, K-3.3, PCT-1.63, and positive COVID PCR. Patient underwent further evaluation with CXR which demonstrated mild left basilar atelectasis vs infiltrate. There was no evidence of significant COVID pneumonia. Patient received IVFs, Rocephin/Azithromycin, and IV protonix. IM was then asked to admit for further care. Following admission, patient was continued on Rocephin and Doxycycline due to concern for bacterial pneumonia with potential aspiration as mother reported aspiration episode at home. Azithromycin was discontinued due to prolonged Qtc. Blood cultures were obtained on admission and remained negative during hospital stay. Patient did not appear to have any significant respiratory compromise from COVID. AKI and hyponatremia resolved with IVFs. Hg was trended closely and dropped somewhat to 7.7 but overall remained stable. There was no evidence of bloody output from feeding tube. Patient was initially placed on IV Protonix. GI was consulted and given there was no evidence of ongoing bleeding, endoscopy was not recommended.  Nutrition managed tube feeds. Electrolytes including potassium and phos were low during hospitalization and were aggressively replaced. Patient otherwise improved back to baseline at time of discharge. She was noted to be alert, smiling, and interactive with mother. She will be discharged on Ceftin/Doxy to complete a total of 5 days of Abx. Mother was instructed to have patient follow up with PCP.

All scans had been normal until then and I was about 5 and 6 months pregnant respectively.  A few weeks after I received the second shot I was sent for a fetal echo based on maternal age.  The scan came back that the baby had a small pericardial effusion.  I was told not to worry but that was impossible to do.  I was told I had to wait one month and re-do the scan which I did.  Fortunately, it was gone at the second scan.  Given the timing and the fact that I had a very strong reaction to the shots, I think it?s possible this was linked to my reaction although, of course, I don?t know whether it was.  The baby was born healthy.  I had a high fever (102), body aches and a headache for several days after the vaccine. The headache lasted one week.  Having lived through this and been very early in getting vaccinated while pregnant, I highly recommend all pregnant women get vaccinated, however, I personally believe Moderna was too strong for me and maybe also for other pregnant women.    Had I known Moderna was so much stronger, I would have tried to get one of the others instead.

Patient was fully vaccinated.  Patient was admitted to the hospital due to altered mental status and generalized weakness in the setting of a scope infection.  Patient was not hypoxic but for a brief moment during admission.  The patient was globally weak and had progressive difficulty ambulating at home until the 20th brought into the ER.  In the ER he was found to have elevated LFTs, general weakness.  Neurology was consulted who recommended CT of the head which was unremarkable aside from chronic changes.  Chest x-ray was done which showed no cardiopulmonary disease.  due to his LFT elevation of the liver ultrasound was performed which showed no evidence of portal vein thrombosis.  Patient was a candidate for monoclonal antibody therapy which he received and tolerated well.  For about 20 the patient had an aspiration event, became more confused, and had 1 fever.  Chest x-ray showed aspiration pneumonitis, white blood cell count was normal, procalcitonin was normal.  Patient recovered quickly, never required oxygen.  Short of breath was consulted who recommended NPO while the patient was confused, this resolved and the patient was able to advance back to a general diet prior to discharge.  patient was evaluated by Physical therapy and Occupational therapy who recommended subacute rehab given the patient's profound weakness in the setting of his recent infection.  Patient was unable to stand without significant assistance.  The patient's wife and daughter were insistent that the patient would do better at home and wanted to set up home health nursing and were adamant that they can't care for the patient better at home than at rehab.  Patient's daughter was heavily involved in the patient's care, she was very concerned about specifically his thyroid medication and felt that missing a few doses of his thyroid medication contributed significantly to his acute decompensation in the hospital.  Given has improvement in mental status, improvement in his vitals, he was afebrile, he was tolerating a general diet, and received adequate therapy for his COVID-19 infection the patient was considered stable for discharge home with home health care with the family support.

To my knowledge he has not received a booster as the Moderna vaccine was just approved for booster consideration.  He has felt ill for the last 3 days, primarily manifested by weakness, decreased appetite, some diarrhea and some mild worsening of his chronic shortness of breath.  He has oxygen and prednisone dependent COPD.  He normally wears 3 L of oxygen during the day and wears 4 L of oxygen with his CPAP at night.  He follows in the clinic with Dr. at the pulmonology specialty clinic.    He presents to the ER with the aforementioned symptoms this evening.  His chest x-ray shows a left pleural effusion at the costophrenic angle.  He is not hypoxic worse than his usual 3 L of oxygen however at this time.  Nonetheless, due to his age and comorbid factors, I agree with the ER physician that admission to the hospital and aggressive treatment for Covid is warranted due to the high risk for further decompensation.

She had diffuse abdominal pain on exam.  Work-up in the ED included CT abdomen/pelvis, which showed no acute findings to explain her presenting symptoms.  Labs revealed INR of 2.8, lactic acid 6.2, WBC count 11.8, potassium 3.3, Cr 1.16.  COVID testing was done in the ED, and returned positive.  Chest x-ray was done, and mild residual infiltrates in both lung bases.  She was given 40 mEq of potassium in the ED, and was transferred from ED to Hospital for admission. Upon admission, she was continued on oxygen at 2 Lpm.  For COVID pneumonia, she was started on Decadron 6 mg daily.  She was treated with anti-tussives and prn Albuterol inhaler.  With supportive treatment, her lactic acid was trended, and trended down.  We were not able to wean her back to room air (she was previously using oxygen only as needed), and she will be discharged with 2 L oxygen at all times.  She will be discharged on 6 mg of Decadron daily for 5 more days. Due to evidence of AKI on presentation, her diuretics were held.  Cr trended down, and was back to baseline, so diuretics were resumed on 10/20, which she tolerated well. Her INR was therapeutic at 2.8 on admission, but did rise to 6.9 by 10/19/21.  Her COumadin was held at that time, and INR drifted back down to 4.1 by time of hospital discharge.  Patient was instructed to hold Coumadin doses on 10/21 and 10/22, and will take 2.5 mg daily on 10/23 and 10/24.  She will have an INR level checked on 10/25, with results/further instructions to be reviewed by anticoagulation clinic.  I did call and speak with anticoagulation clinic nurse today, and made them aware of these recommendations. She was felt stable for discharge home on 10/21/21.  She will be discharged home on 5 more days of Decadron.  She should follow-up with PA in 1 week.  She will hold Coumadin on 10/21 and 10/22, and will take 2.5 mg of Coumadin on 10/23 and 10/24, with a follow-up INR to be drawn on 10/25.

Pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus   This is a 67-year-old female who presents with chest pain.  She has a complicated recent medical history including discharge from the hospital 2 days ago for COVID pneumonia.  Discharge note says she was sent home on oxygen, but she arrived on room air.  She also has a history of admission a few months ago for CHF resulting in pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis.  She has a history of AFib on Coumadin, peripheral vascular disease.  The pain she describes today is sharp and pleuritic.  She does describe dyspnea as well.  On exam she is not hypoxic.  She has no lower extremity edema.  Lung sounds are clear.  Due to her pleuritic chest pain, recent hospitalization and COVID diagnosis a CT angiogram thorax was ordered which shows no pool pulmonary embolism but does show evidence of COVID pneumonia.  We also performed a cardiac workup which included 2 EKGs, showing AFib rate controlled and 2 troponins with BNP.  BNP is slightly elevated but baseline varies.  Troponins are flat.  Pain she describes does not sound anginal.  Based on the likelihood her chest pain is from COVID pneumonia I do not feel she requires further cardiac workup.  She was found have a leukocytosis of 25. Etiology for this may be partially due to Decadron use.  She has been on Decadron for approximately 8 days.  She is afebrile, non tachycardic here.  I added a urinalysis which shows no evidence of infection.  Blood cultures were added and are pending.  CT abdomen/pelvis was ordered few days ago that showed no acute abnormalities.  I added a procalcitonin level but that is a send out.  Due to the leukocytosis that seems a little high to be purely Decadron related I did order empiric antibiotics, Rocephin and doxycycline.  Prescribe Ceftin and doxycycline as well.  Her INR was also found be low but I recommended she have this rechecked as antibiotics may affect levels.  She has a pulse ox monitor at home that she is to use if she feels dyspneic.  She knows she is return to the emergency department if she feels worse, specifically if she denies any exertional chest pain or chest pain associated with radiation/nausea/diaphoresis, she develops any hypoxia.  She states she does have in-home help and I recommended she try to see if the frequency of this can be increased.

The patient's concomitant medications included nightly unspecified blood-thinning injection. It was reported that the patient felt the onset of symptoms two weeks later vaccination. He experienced strange pangs first struck after a mere 20-minute ride on the stationary bike at the gym. Then he could not sleep through the night, with a fiery, tingly feeling under the skin. His midsection and fingertips grew numb. One morning he woke up slurring with words out the left side of the mouth. Three visits to the emergency room and one spinal tap later, an astute doctor scribbled the diagnosis on the whiteboard of the hospital room as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). He was in for several more days of anguish, while fresh antibodies injected intravenously tried to call off the friendly fire. And then months of rehabilitation, taking baby steps with a walker, and otherwise spending long hours flat on the back. While at first he was pretty angry. His immune system rigorously executed what it thought were orders to take the hill. Before he was completely in tatters left unchecked, the doctors administered three treatments for what turned out to be the stubborn case. The first was the infusion of fresh antibodies through immunoglobulin therapy, known as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg); the second was plasmapheresis, a more-thorough oil change where all the rogue antibodies were sucked out through a tube in the neck and replaced with synthetic plasma. Finally, he was given steroids to tamp down the inflammation that lingered like smoldering fires after the initial bomb blast. Much damage was done, however not only to those myelin sheaths but some of the underlying nerves themselves. He was discharged to rehabilitation hospital, where he spent hours in the gym overlooking harbor, feeling like a toddler and learning to walk all over again. He was outfitted with a walker just like the 90-year-old mother used. Impossibly fit trainers guided him through a rigorous physical and occupational therapy program: up and down practice stairs, in and out of a practice car, exercises on mats, timed tests adorning racks with spring-loaded clips, to help bring back sensory function and fine motor skills, as part of the exercise he picked up small objects in a special machine that whirled shredded corn husks around inside a clear box. He would get back to the room and collapse from exhaustion and disbelief. After weeks at hospital and rehabilitation, it left him with feeling beaten up and weak. The mental challenge has been formidable. He celebrated triumphs like graduating from a walker to a cane, but also he periodically break down in tears. His hands and feet remain numb and tingly.

A 46-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Sep2021 14:00 (at the age of 46-years-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (MOTRIN SINUS HEADACHE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received ANTHRAX VACCINE in 2004, then at least 2-3 other times in 2005. The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Sep2021. He reported several side effects after receiving the vaccine (Sep2021) including arm was a little sore, he urinate a lot which was unusual, had urgency that if he does not get to the bathroom he would pee his pants, upset stomach like diarrhea, pain in the center of his back, right side hurting a lot, feet have been extremely sore (very painful like it's broken), insomnia and waking up in the middle of the night and not able to go back to sleep, pain around the left side of his chest, headache that are almost migraines, feeling like he have a nail in his foot, toes still numb and throbbing, heart rate 200 bpm and elevated resting heart rate. He was asking if this was normal. He noted that he was hesitant to get the second dose and he feels like this was not normal. He is contributing it to the vaccine as he has never felt this extreme pain. He clarified all events started about 10Sep2021 and progressed, worsened after that point. Besides arm a little sore, pretty normal; but it got to the point where he would have to pee a lot, very unusual for him.  You only get to go at certain times, so it's not uncommon for him to drink a couple of liters of water and not go to bathroom until the next morning. He was like waiting to pee for like 2 days and when he went to urinate only very little urine came out, just a few ounces; that's not normal and that was with him feeling like he was ready to pee his pants. It's like that every morning now when he wakes up, and at least 3-4 times a day now. The amount of urine output varies, but it could be the smallest or largest drink of water it doesn't matter, normally he can hold it, now if he tries to hold it too long he is going to pee his pants. He started having upset stomach almost like diarrhea like symptoms; he figured that was just part of symptoms. Probably about 4 days into it he started getting pains like in center of his back that felt like joint pains right on his spine; feels like he had to crack his back but cracking his back wouldn't do it. The right side started hurting a lot almost like he got punched in the kidneys. His feet were extremely sore for some reason which he initially chalked it up to him walking in his boots because he walks about 4-5 miles every day in his boots; but that's normal for him and prior to this was no issue. Initially he just figured it was something he was doing. He has had little bit of insomnia or waking in middle of the night not going back to sleep. He has had a dull pain right around the left side of his breast, chest. Some of these reactions have lessened a lot. Him having to go urinate was still constant. He has been getting slight headaches that almost turn into a migraine. He takes Motrin to try to beat it down, the headaches and for his foot. Motrin doesn't really make it go away. His left foot has gone about 80% away; but his right foot if he was going to say pain scale from 1-10 is probably a 9. It feels like a nail in his foot. When he goes to sleep at night it's throbbing; feels like, if he broke a bone or dropped something on his toe, like a throbbing pain, very painful; and occurs even when he is totally off his feet, could be in middle of night and it wakes him up at night. He really never had that issue; while he's walking it's really bad because feels like a nail in his foot; but he has to go to work. He took Motrin yesterday and felt a little better yesterday. Today still a very sharp pain when he's walking. The left foot is still kind of sore; but now also when he is driving his toes are throbbing. Big toe and little toes are numb and they throb every so often. Almost like got hit in the foot with a sledgehammer which he reported happened to him years ago. The pain in his right side has gone away; it's really not there. The pain in his upper back, middle upper back between shoulder blades feels tight at times. He still has a dull pain, not as sharp as it was, on front left side of chest. Yesterday he had weird migraine and he does not get those. He also has extreme tiredness, fatigue; one day not far after the Pfizer Covid-19 Shot, he does not remember exact date, he barely got home by 16:30 and was out, asleep until the next day; he went to sleep for 12.5 hours. Every so often at least 1-2 times week he still gets very fatigued. He has also had his heart rate jumping to up to over 200 beats per minute for couple minutes then go back down; date or time of onset: believe within the first 2 weeks after he got the Pfizer Covid-19 Shot. Currently his resting heart rate was way up around 90 and that was usually between 60-70. He used to keep track of that and his girlfriend was a nurse who keeps close eye on it. He asked if these reactions are common, because he was starting to get concerned. At the end of the day it was not normal to feel like this, and it really does bother him, he was ready to quit his job if it comes down to it, rather than getting another dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Shot. Right now he lives alone. He does not want to have some weird blood clot or something some kind of issue. The events does not required emergency room and/or physician office visit. The outcome of heart rate jumping to up to over 200 beats per minute was recovered; while the other events was not recovered.

At this time I took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen. At approximately 23:00 I woke-up in the night drenched in sweat, had a high-grade fever of 102.7 F, severe whole body aches, dizziness, and a feeling of being disconnected from reality. I took 1000 mg more Acetaminophen and tried to go back to sleep. However, I experienced insomnia and a tingling sensation that ran from the top of my head to the small of my back every time I shifted in bed trying to get comfortable. I again took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 05:00 to keep the fever under control. I managed to get out of bed and tried light walking to help with circulation to offer some relief to the persistent headache that did not abate with the Acetaminophen. The body aches, fever, dizziness, chills, , and tingling sensation - from crown of head to small of back - upon moving head side to side persisted throughout the day; the severity of symptoms was abated approximately 30 min - 45 min post Acetaminophen administration. The night of the 22nd I experienced terrifyingly vivid nightmares, fever -- 101.9, body aches, and chills throughout the night; however, I did not experience any night sweats.

It had spread to the other side of my neck and all over my stomach. On October 5th, it started spreading from my thighs down to my kneecaps. I was taking over the counter Benadryl for it. The spots didn't itch, but they felt like a burning sensation. That whole week I was down in the dumps with flu like symptoms. I visited the ER on October 10th, because I had woken up and felt extremely sick. I couldn't breathe so the EMS came and took me to that hospital. They ran some tests, and they diagnosed me with an unspecified rash. My oxygen level was low, so they gave me oxygen before I left the hospital. Then they sent me home with steroids to take for the rash. I went to the ER about 5 times within a 3-week span because of the rash I had that continued to spread up my back and in my hairline. My hair was coming out. They had given me steroids, a steroid injection, Atarax, Zyrtec, and Cipro for the rash to help clear it up, but none of the medications, or injections worked. On 10/25/2021, I was able to see my PCP. He said that he wants me to see an allergist since the medicines have not helped the rash. He thought it was an allergic reaction due to the vaccine. I haven't changed anything with my body or hair products except only taking the shot. I have been sick ever since taking that shot. I keep losing train of thought. I have been off work because of this. I am so exhausted and tired. I sleep for 12 hours a day. I am off work until 11/3/2021 or it may be continued if I am still sick.

Myeloproliferative neoplasm, usually manifesting as essential thrombocythemia (excessive platelets) once as polycythemia vera (excessive red blood cells), no sign so far of other forms of the disease such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia/hypereosinophilic syndrome. Did test positive for the mutation in the JAK2 gene. Treatment: Hydroxyurea 500mg 1 x day 5 days per week. Status: Stable for months since initial diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera in Jan-Feb 2017. ? Proteinuria. Status: Stable, monitored periodically by blood tests to watch for multiple myeloma since about 2017. No treatment. Doctor says - I think - that this is a monoclonal gammopathy which may or may not be related to the Myeloproliferative neoplasm and/or renal insufficiency. ? Stage 3b renal insufficiency. No treatment. Status: Stable. ? Hypertension. Generally around 152/67 on current meds. Treatment: Atenolol 25mg 1 x day, Amlodipine 10mg 1 x day, Losartan/HCTZ 100/25 1 x day. Status: Stable subject to med changes. ? Gout?/metatarsalgia (right foot). Looking for explanation for pain in right foot, found increased uric acid in blood. Started Allopurinol 100mg 1 x day. Pain in foot determined by x-ray/CT scan (or MRI, can't remember which) to be deterioration and inflammation of metatarsal joints, treated by Meloxicam for about a year. No pain after Meloxicam discontinued, but Allopurinol has been continued. ? Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (2014). Restriction: Extreme caution on taking Nsaids. ? Mild indigestion due to rebound from pantoprazole. Pantoprazole was taken with the Meloxicam mentioned above due to the gastic sleeve restriction on nsaids. When the Meloxicam was discontinued, tried to discontinue the Pantoprazole as well and got significant indigestion. Restarted it and tapered it off, but still have mild indigestion. Famotidine 20mg 1x day. ? Arterial blockage in right inner thigh diagnosed 2018. Body has formed alternate pathways around the blockage so that the blood supply, though low, is sufficient such that there are no symptoms except under exercise (e.g. walking more than 5-10 minutes); pain results in right calf, goes away after exercise continues (presumably as increased heart rate provides greater blood supply, but that's just my guess). Treatment: Examination and testing by vascular surgeon annually to monitor; Simvastatin 10mg 1 x day as preventative against additional blockage, though my cholesterol numbers are uniformly normal. Status: Stable. ? Lower extremity edema, probably due to medication, different meds would likely have worse side effects,  ? Spot on tail of pancreas. Unchanged after several annual CT scans, almost certainly benign, probably result of ""bump"" during gastric sleeve surgery. Now CT every 2 years. ? Type II Diabetes. Controlled by gastric sleeve, no current treatment or diet. ? Ongoing skin conditions: Multiple repeated actinic keratosis, 6-7 squamous cell carcinoma (1 remaining to be removed; others removed without recurrence), mild eczema, rosacea (face). ? Amblyopia due to insufficiently corrected crossed eyes after surgery at age 4 (left eye mostly ignored except for peripheral vision). Cataracts not yet ripe for treatment. ?
