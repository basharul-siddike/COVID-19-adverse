In the midst of everything he instructed another pharmacy technician to call 911 for the paramedics. As she was in the process of drinking water I saw her other hand go to the region of the neck, thinking it was also an allergic reaction and administered a dose of Epi-Pen. He administered the Epi-Pen on the upper side of her thigh, directly to the skin not through clothing. There was a very brief moment where the patient began to convulse but gradually regain consciousness. The patient became lucid and was conversing with him, apologizing for the incident. He assured her there was nothing to apologize for and to which she told me she had similar incidents from vaccinations as a child. She did not mention this prior to administration of the vaccine and through conversation we believe the incident may be caused from high anxiety of needles / vaccinations.

However, at approximately 3am on Friday (4/9), I woke up with a fair amount of discomfort in all of the fingers in my left (dominant) hand. It felt like what I would imagine someone suffering from arthritis might feel; I got up to take some ibuprofen and I had difficulty grasping the doorknob, for example. The pain mostly subsided by the time I woke back up, although there was some very minor continued stiffness in my left index finger, which also eventually seemed to go away after a few days.  Fast forward to this morning (4/13) and I woke up around 5am with renewed discomfort and stiffness in my left index finger, requiring ibuprofen.

This was completed on 2/26/21 - 4 days after the 1st shot. My doctor reviewed the results on 3/5/21. TSH levels for me are typicall between a range of .3 to .6.  This labwork showed the TSH level to be 24.58. This is off the charts, Dr.  increased my Levothyroxine 2 levels from 75 mg to 100  mg.  An ultrasound was also scheduled since Hashimotos Disease means a goiter is present on the thyroid gland. I was diagnosed in 1994. Up to this time, I have NEVER had a TSH level of 24.58. My level has been consistent in the range required or varied slightly. I will be having the TSH level tested again on 4/29/21. Results should be available a couple of days after that. I received the 2nd Covid vaccination on 3/17/21.  The ultrasound on my throat was scheduled on 3/22/21. The results showed significant changes in size of the lymph nods and more importantly the nodule on the right side of the goiter has now increased in size. Prior ultrasounds have shown no change in growth and one test showed a decrease in size of the goiter. The recommndation was to have a CT scan for further evaluation. The CT scan was scheduled on 4/6/21. The results showed the lymph nodes to be reactive which is not a concern. However, the right side nodule on the goiter now requires a fine needle aspiration to send for a biopsy. The fine needle aspiration is scheduled on 4/19/21. The results should be available in approx 5 days (4/23 or 4/26) I have an appointment scheduled with an Endocrinologist to review all test results. This issue can result in necessary surgery to remove the Thyroid gland. I now have difficulty swallow whole food unless chewed thoroughly.  This whole situation has become unsettling and scary.

A low procalcitonin should prompt the  investigation of non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of patient clinical status.  Repeat low  or declining procalcitonin (>80% from peak) may indicate an opportunity for antibiotic  de-escalation or discontinuation. Low procalcitonin levels in the presence of acute bronchitis,  COPD exacerbations, and other related conditions generally indicates the absence of clinically  significant bacterial infections.

1203934,04/13/2021,KY,36.0,36,,F,,"On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well.

My symptoms lasted 21 days and started with major gastrointestinal issues, headache, and cough.  - Had a negative COVID-19 PCR test on February 25, 2021  - this negative PCR was needed to travel back. - Landed on February 28, 2021 and completed my quarantine at my parents house.  - I returned to work on the 15th of March, 2021.  - Over the weekend I traveled and flew back on April 5, 2021. Because I had flown, I was doing a courtesy and went to the local store to get a rapid antigen test.  APRIL 8, 2021 - left work at 12:30 and went to the store to get the rapid antigen test which came back positive. I was told by the nurses that it only came back positive because it has been less than 90 days since I initially tested positive. I was told I did not need to self-isolate and could go about as normal. I had my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on this day at 2:00 p.m. I went to get my second jab. Just to be safe, after my jab I went to the local urgent care where they took a nasal swab for a PCR test. The results of the PCR test came back Saturday, April 10 about 7:30 that evening and the result was ""NOT DETECTED"".  SYMPTOMS: Thursday, April 8th  about 8:00 pm I started to have difficulty breathing and taking a deep breath was difficult. I put it down to anxiety about the initial positive test. Saturday, the difficulty breathing continued, along with new pressure in my chest. I was unable to sleep Saturday night - as soon as I was nearly sleep, I would wake up gasping for a breath. Sunday, the pressure in my chest continued and so did the difficulty breathing. I went to the Emergency Room on Sunday, April 11 about 4:15 pm - they took a chest x-ray, ran blood tests, and did an EKG which all came back completely normal - no pneumonia, heart attack, or blood clots.

I took 2 Tylenol and went back to sleep.  Woke up about 8:00am on 3/28/21 with a fever of 102.6, stiff neck, chills, nausea, headache.  Continued with Tylenol throughout day.  For 3 days I had all of those symptoms plus diarrhea. I assumed this was normal but was getting concerned because I had no symptoms from the first vaccine on 3/5/21.  I never got a stiff or painful arm but I did get a rash on my arm face and neck starting on 3/31/21.  The rash continues on my neck, face and shoulder intermittently to date, more than 2 weeks later.  On 3/31/21 about 12 noon my fever had gone down to 99.0.  Every time I would get out of bed my fever would spike immediately to 101 or 102.  On 4/1/21 I called the nurse through my insurance company and she said to stop taking the Tylenol and if the fever continued to go to Urgent Care on 4/2/21, which is what I did.  They performed a rapid Covid test which was negative and my fever was normal but my blood pressure was quite high which is not normal for me.  I had nausea, headache, fatigue, sore muscles.  They really didn't tell me what to do and said my reaction to the vaccine was ""normal"" and they didn't know how long it would last.  It is now more than 2 weeks after the vaccine and I do not feel great.  Although the fever has gone away I still have the intermittent rash, nausea, diarrhea, stiff neck.  The soonest I could get an appointment with my Primary Care doctor is 3/27/21.  I am concerned because I have the gene mutation Prothombin 20210A (Factor 2) which is  a clotting disorder.  In 2010 I was hospitalized and almost died from a massive DVT and PE in both lungs.  I did not know until I was admitted to hospital that I had this clotting disorder.

My symptoms began around 3 am (~13 hours after injection, early Saturday morning) with joint and muscle aches and pains along with injection site pain and slight nausea.  I took  tylenol 2-500 mg capsules at ~4:30 am.   Severe chills started around 8 am.  I took tylenol 2-500 mg capsules at 10 am and went to  sleep covered in blankets to try to keep warm.  I woke up around 1:45pm sweating and very warm.  I took my temperature and it was 101.8F.  My ""normal"" is around 97.7F.  This worried me very much since I was on tylenol. I made sure to drink plenty of water (iced).   The fever dropped to 100F around 6 pm and stayed there.  I could not take more tylenol due to stomach upset.   The fever continued into the second day (Sunday)post-injection staying around 99-100F without tylenol.     By later Sunday, the aches and pains had subsided significantly.  Sunday night I had more bouts of chills with fever off and on all night.  This continued into Monday all day.  By Monday night, i was feeling more normal.   Had I not been feeling better I would have sought medical care.  I am left with slight nausea and an acid-y feeling stomach today, Tuesday. I am a DVM who has worked in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry and wanted to express my concern with this type of reaction to a vaccine.  In my humble opinion having a vaccine that causes a person to be sick for nearly 3 days after is unacceptable!  If it weren't for the pandemic, I don't think this would be approved due to the severity of the reaction.

Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain.

Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 �F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.

A headache started in mid afternoon and kept increasing throughout the rest of day.  I have not had a headache in years.  Around 7:00 PM on Thursday, I had to sleep.  I was extremely tired.  My body had chills and I had to wear a sweatshirt and full set of clothes to bed just to stay warm.  That is very unusual.  I am usually throwing off covers every night throughout the entire year.    I did not eat dinner because there was no appetite.  I slept in bed for at least 12 hours.  Typical night sleep = 8 hours.  The next morning was no issue and therefore I did not go seek medical help because there are supposed to be side effects to vaccines.  Now, I am reporting it because headache and the stiff muscles were identified on the news.  However, it was around 24-36 hours and not the 6 days on the news.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/07/2021,04/08/2021,1,N/A,UNK,,None,None,None,,,2,04/13/2021,,,,None

I decided to take 2 extra strength tylenol to aid in the fever/chills and severe headache.  Unfortunately, two days prior to vaccine, I was diagnosed by CT scan that I had a kidney stone.  It was being treated with Toradol, which I only took at bedtime with the also, prescribed Flomax.  The Toradol did little to assuage my body aches, incidentally  My fever only came down to 101.4 .  It remained between 101.4 and 102 until 48 hours post vaccination, when it finally went down to 99.2.  I could only get out of bed to use the bathroom.

When she has the next dose of Mavenclad, the B and T cells will be depleted again and when the B and T cells come back they are ""tricked"" so they won't attack her body. Her hair fell out in clumps with the Mavenclad and her throat swelled too. She would really like a haircut to fix her hair. She premedicated prior to receiving the Mavenclad.

The patient's medical history included gastric bypass and rheumatoid arthritis.

It is unknown if the patient has history of fillers or toxins. Almost exactly 4 weeks prior to the injection, the patient had the COVID-19 vaccine, but the healthcare professional is not sure which one the patient received (pending clarification).

The lady cleaning the patient's house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient's son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her.

The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient's potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021.

A 56-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 24Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER2613) as a single dose for to prevent COVID (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included having blood clot from 2019 to Mar2021 which the patient stated a couple of weeks ago (Mar2021), she had an ultrascan in her leg and the blood clot was not there, but she is on medication. The patient has recovered completely from blood clot (not ongoing). Concomitant medication included warfarin (WARFARIN) to prevent from having blood clot ongoing since Jun2019. The patient previously took gabapentin for pain but had throat started closing, allergic reaction, coughing and was intubated until she was released from hospital; and albuterol [salbutamol] for dyspnoea but had nebulizer to open up her airways and prevent closing and did not work (drug ineffective). The reporter mentioned that the patient ended up in the ICU because of the COVID vaccine. As soon as the vaccine was administered within seconds, the patient experienced a reaction and was given an epi pen, another epi pen even an epinephrine drip and was sedated and intubated. The reporter mentioned that they gave the patient the first shot of epi pen and it did not work, and she was given a second one and a third one plus steroids. By the time the ambulance people arrived, they hooked the patient up to an IV and gave her additional epinephrine and administered another epinephrine. The ambulance guy told her; she does not need to keep up with them because they needed to go to the hospital ASAP because the patient is not getting better but getting worse. Once the patient got to hospital, she was intubated because her throat was closing. The reporter stated that the patient has allergies to begin with and this was worse than the first time she had to be intubated. The epi pens did not work, the patient was intubated and then had to be sedated. The patient was on Propofol in order to sedate her and later on in the evening was given Fentanyl to relax her then the epinephrine drip was removed at 6 pm on 24Mar2021. The epinephrine drip was started in the emergency room and the patient could not be moved to the intensive care unit until she was somewhat stable. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit and was there overnight and by the time next morning she was able to be extubated where they removed the tube from her around 9:30 to 10:00 25Mar2021. Of course, the patient was taken off Propofol, but she went through a lot and her legs are sore, throat is sore, and is coughing on 25Mar2021 because of the side effects from being intubated and that she went through a lot. The intensive care unit doctor said that the patient can no longer have the vaccine and she would only be 70% protected till whenever they are not sure how long the vaccine will last. The adverse events almost took the patient's life which made the reporter angry at that. The reporter is not sure what the contents in the vaccine that it in the other drugs and vaccines since there is something that is contained in all of them and the patient was not allowed to have any whether it is the Pfizer or Moderna and it is even up for discussion for even the flu shot because of the reaction and there does not want to be any chances and that everything should be proceeded with caution. The reporter wanted to know what is in the COVID 19 vaccine to see about what could have caused the allergic anaphylactic reaction. The reporter stated and the fact that the epi pen did not work, she was taken aback. The reporter added that the doctor had a hard time intubating because of her throat but they were able to intubate from the second time. The reporter stated that it is taking a while but her wife is recovering and feeling it is taking a while taking a little bit longer. The reporter also stated that they kept the patient in the intensive care unit overnight and after the tube was removed in the morning, by the late afternoon she was moved to a different floor to continue to be observed and the intensive care doctor said 2 days out her wife would be safe to go. The patient stood up but it was hard for her to walk on 25Mar2021 because it could have been from the epi pen, but she is not sure. The patient stated the side effect came out of the allergic reaction and it was on Thursday 25Mar2021. Patient stated the main trouble is her breathing, she is out of breath still and really sore throat on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that the leg sore is still ongoing and is about the same. It was mentioned that the throat sore was still ongoing but some days are worse and some days are better. The patient stated that when she has a problem trying to swallow a tablet and digest it and it gets stuck on Mar2021. It was stated that the cough was not going away. The cough comes and goes away. She will cough for five minutes constantly and then it disappears then she will fall asleep and wake up coughing. It's as if she is choking (Mar2021). When she is talking, she coughs more. With regards to the allergic anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated she is experiencing the aftereffects of the allergic reaction and being intubated like being out of breath. The patient stated that will come in time and that's what happens when she gets intubated. Her breathing was heavy and comes back fully with rest on Mar2021. This has taken a lot out of her. She was feeling tired which was still ongoing it is about the same but comes and goes on 25Mar2021. The patient is experiencing lingering side effects and the patient does not feel as if she has recovered completely. It was also mentioned that the patient was intubated on 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021. It was reported that treatment of the patient included Epi Pen, Epinephrine Autoinjector USP 0.3 mg (Epinephrine injection manufacturer was Mylan) which the patient was given at least three injections (two in the right leg and 1 on the left) then received another in the ambulance (unknown site). Patient received an Epinephrine drip and it was like 0.1 mg all the way up until 6 pm (only on 24Mar2021). The epinephrine drip was started when patient was intubated at the hospital. It was given for patient's allergic reaction through IV. The patient's lungs were filling up with fluid so her airway was restricting her from breathing and to prevent damage of the lungs that is when the intubation came in. The patient also received Prednisone which the reporter does not recall when this medication was started it may have been after the epinephrine drip was removed but she is not sure if they started the prednisone after or if it was the same evening which the reporter kind of thinks it was. The reporter stated that the patient took Propofol 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 which was given through the patient's IV and was given to help her airways being intubated, they sedate their patients. The patient also received fentanyl which must have been added either right before Epinephrine drip was removed or after but reporter does not recall. Patient was given Fentanyl 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 through her IV. Patient received this medication to relax because sometimes it is like some patients tend to want to sit up and kind of hear you, hear what people are saying and to relax patient sometimes because they can get scared and not exactly sure what is going on.

Initially pt was advised to pretreat before her second dose, but a web-based consult was done in the interim with the following advice: This doesn?t appear to be an immediate type allergic reaction. Benadryl would not be expected to prevent a reaction. I do have some concern about a second dose having the potential to induce a much more intense reaction. This one is very atypical but doesn?t appear to be insignificant. Unless the patient has very significant risk factors for a severe case of COVID, I would refrain from a second dose. There is nothing wrong in continuing cetirizine if it helps with current itching. A second opinion on the web-based eConsult service yielded the following: Having a delayed reaction is not a contraindication toward getting the 2nd dose. However, I see 1 vesicular/bullous lesion on her rash, which is concerning as the next dose may develop into bullous dermatitis or SJS. In this case, I would definitely encourage patient getting the J&J vaccine given that patient had reaction towards mRNA one. If patient does get the 2nd dose of mRNA vaccine, I would recommend it on the other arm. I would tell her to start taking cetirizine 1 tablet twice daily for 1-2 weeks, and I would also prescribe her topical Triamcinolone twice daily to put on when rash erupts. Having anaphylaxis would be unlikely, but I would still prescribe her an epinephrine autoinjector to be on the cautious side since some people have mixed drug reactions (both type 1 and type 4). I would wait until her symptoms fully resolve before she gets the J&J vaccine. Given that she had a reaction to a prior COVID vaccine, I would prescribe epipen just in case even if she gets J&J. Again, highly unlikely she would react with anaphylaxis but it's always good to be safe. will send pt epipen and give counseling as above.  Allergist #1 response: I think above is reasonable. Reasonable regarding giving J&J.

I wasn't expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week's time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the ""normal"" side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense ""zings"" that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful ""zings"" reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn't feel comfortable driving and didn't want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn't feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn't get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor's appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn't get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin' ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.

In fact, I went on a hard 7 mile run the next day as part of my normal training routine (currently training for a half Marathon.)  This past Thursday, April 8, at 6:00 pm EST, I had my 2nd shot (Lot EW0161).  For about the next 18 hours, I was fine other than the arm being a little sore in the morning. Late in the morning I noticed my back was getting very stiff and a bit sore when I moved around.  I have a desk job and spend a lot of time in front of the computer, but I normally stretch and move throughout most days, so I don?t have many back issues.  This was a bit worse than normal.  Usually, when I feel something like this, my go to remedy is an easy run.  I had a 5 mile easy run planned for that day, so later in the afternoon, after some dynamic stretching, I went for a run.  As I started, I felt some of the worse back pain I could remember and stopped running after about 50 yards.  I stretched a little more, questioning if I should continue, but decided that movement would be better than doing nothing.  I started running again and although the first mile was much more uncomfortable and painful than normal, I continued on for the 5 miles with everything eventually loosening up as the blood starting flowing.  I felt pretty good the rest of the day and into the evening.  In the middle of the night, I awoke numerous times with a bad ache in my back, which is very unusual for me. I tossed and turned all night from side to side, from front to back but could not stop the burn and pain in my lower back.  I took 2 Advil, but that did little to help.  I got out of bed about an hour earlier than normal and after a little light stretching, my back felt fine again.  I went for my weekly long 14 mile run an hour later and everything was good again and for the rest of the day.  The next 3 days / nights have been similar.  I continue waking each night with a burning and aching in my lower back and it continues all night long.  Once I stand up, get out of bed and start moving around, the pain and burning go away almost immediately.  I?ve never felt anything like this before.  I?m 57, male, am very healthy and fit (aiming for a 1:30 half marathon in 10 days.)  Never had issues with sleeping before this and haven?t experienced any back pain in a very long time.

Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like ""rash"" along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior.

My injection was given by a nurse at the Hospital and while I did not watch the needle enter into my shoulder, I quickly developed the symptoms of adhesive capsulitis to my right shoulder within a few hours. Initially I did not realize why I was in such extreme pain but did notice that the injection site and bandage placed over top seemed very high. The next day I could not move my shoulder in any direction without severe pain. Regardless of this I still presented to work as I had no one to cover my shift but wasn't able to continue working due to the amount of pain and inability to use my right arm. My coworker is a family medicine Doctor who reached out to a local orthopedic surgeon and fortunately I was able to get a same day visit with the orthopedist. He diagnosed frozen shoulder on January 26, 2021 citing improper placement of the vaccine and I was prescribed a variety of medications including muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory medicine. He offered to give me a shoulder joint injection however I was concerned about a corticosteroid affecting the efficacy of the Covid vaccine that I had just received. After only minimal relief with the medications that were prescribed hi was in directed by the orthopedic surgeon to start physical therapy which I did. Physical therapy sessions were only partially helpful, and I was still having limitations with my work duties as well as activities of daily living in my home (Such as being able to trust myself, wash my hair, use a blow dryer, doing light housework with my right arm well-being right hand dominant etc.). Finally, after eight weeks of conservative treatment not helping and daily pain I opted for a right shoulder joint corticosteroid injection at orthopedic office. Just a day after the steroid joint injection in my right shoulder I was significantly improved and for a few weeks I was actually pain-free. Unfortunately, a few days ago my shoulder pain started to recur and I have been advised by my orthopedic surgeon that the next step is an MRI and potentially more invasive treatments. I have no way of knowing the name of the nurse at the Hospital who administered my vaccine, and no reporting channels as I am not an employee of that facility. I was able to get the vaccine without being an employee because of my company's relationship with that facility. I have reported this to my employer however, as well as through the V-safe check ins.

I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn't as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It's now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body.

I was ill that night and still feeling tired the following day and feverish. My left knee, which I had previously had a lateral meniscus transplant with a cadaver graft, starting swelling up and becoming increasingly uncomfortable. By Wednesday the 17th, I could barely put weight on the leg and the pain level had increased to 6/10, with 10 being the worst pain. This knee had previously been on a positive healing trajectory since my surgery. By Wednesday night, I couldnt put weight on it and pulled out the crutches to walk (I had been off of them since early February). I was dealing with a family emergency so did not have the capacity to deal with it at the time. Thursday morning, the 18th, all of my joints started becoming painful. I chalked this up to vaccine reaction. I was still fatigued and the knee was still extremely sensitive and couldn't bear weight. Friday and Friday night my joints became visible swollen and were so painful I was crying trying to find a comfortable sleeping position. I couldn't put any pressure on my shoulders for sleeping, the neck was stiff and tight, my hands and feet were visibly swollen with fluid and I couldnt even lift a cup due to the painful, enlarged finger joints. Every joint in my body seemed effected. Saturday morning I called my doctor who determined it was due to the vaccine and it seemed my immune system was attacking my joints. I was prescribed 40mg of predinsone in a 8 day taper. By 24 hours, the pain had receeded to a normal level of ache and I could put some pressure on my left leg again.

On an unknown date, four days before onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA) dosing, the patient was hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia. Her sputum culture grew Proteus and Acinetobacter species. On an unknown date, the patient received onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA), one-time intravenous infusion administered concomitantly with corticosteroid (prednisolone 1 day prior to the infusion, and for a minimum of 30 days following treatment). On an unknown date, three days after onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA) dosing, the patient developed second event of pneumonia. On an unknown date, six days after onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA) dosing, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate) (manufacturer unknown) (exact dose, dose#, route of administration, lot# and expiration date were not reported), concomitantly with an unspecified influenza virus vaccine live (exact dose, dose#, route of administration, lot# and expiration date were not reported) and pneumococcal 4 6b 9v 14 18c 19f 23f conj vaccine (crm197) (PREVNAR) (exact dose, dose#, route of administration, lot# and expiration date were not reported), all for prophylaxis. On an unknown date, seven days after onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA) dosing, the patient developed hypertension and decreased urine output as first symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA developed with hemolytic anemia, hematuria, proteinuria, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and severe hypertension. Renal ultrasound scan indicated diffuse increase in cortical echogenicity bilaterally. Functional TMA panel indicated evidence of complement pathway activation with no autoantibodies or abnormal complement components (low complement C4 (0.07 g/L), and normal complement C3 (1.1 g/L), complement Factor H (CFH) (369 mg/L), complement Factor I (34 mg/L), negative complement factor H autoantibody (CFHAb) (less than 50 AU), complement total (CH50) (160 U eq/mL), high soluble complex C3b-9 (0.9 mg/L)). Genetic evaluation was not performed. Other laboratory evidence of TMA included: hemoglobin 7 g/dL (Nadir) (on day 7 after onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA) dosing; baseline: 10.3 g/dL); platelet count 17 k/micro-l (Nadir) (baseline: 503 k/micro-l); creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (peak) (baseline: 0.1 mg/dL); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 4208 U/L (peak). There was protein and blood present in the urine. Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR) were normal. Stool and urine cultures were negative. ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) assay was normal. The patient was treated with packed red blood cell (PRBC) and platelets transfusions, glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, diuretic for fluid overload, antihypertensives. The features of TMA resolved within 2 weeks, except hypertension, which continued to persist 1 year later. The authors of the article considered TMA to be drug-induced by onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA), resulting from immune-mediated etiology. Additionally, TMA was related to concurrent infection with encapsulated bacteria and vaccine exposure to haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate) (manufacturer unknown), unspecified influenza virus vaccine live and pneumococcal 4 6b 9v 14 18c 19f 23f conj vaccine (crm197) (PREVNAR).

Many of the delay had been 48 to 72 hours.  I didn't feel like going to the Farmer's Market and by 2 pm started getting a migraine headache which had be concerned.   I had not had any fever but had had arm pain that I had used a heating pad for.  I ate Saturday.  I started noticing neck stiffness and some difficulty moving my head right and left.  I had migraine headaches from age 13 - 50 with an increase during pregnancy so I knew what they were and  what I had started to experience as the night went on into Sunday was more than I had ever  experienced in my life.  Flat on my back, ice, no intake, tylenol/codeine, nothing did anything and and the intensity kept coming.  I vomited some Sunday evening which usually helps release the pressure, but nothing helped.  I continued to have more difficulty turning my neck from side to side, visual difficulties and excruciating pain.  I had a virtual appointment with my endocrinologist and she was concerned about what was going on and gave me some guidelines lines about managing my blood sugars and suggesting that I be on the Farxiga if I went in the hospital.  I made it through another virtual meeting basically holding my head in my hands.  I canceled all my dental and doctor appointments because of the unrelenting pain and my concern for my driving. I began having some spastic jerking of the head and neck, which with the mask on forced my teeth into my front gums and lacerated the wholes front inside of my mouth. On 3/23 my husband died unexpectedly, I canceled Wednesday's Funeral Home visit because of my concern regarding driving and the extreme degree of pain.  I could barely move my neck past center.  I was also having mobility issues and my right side was working as well as it should.  Typing and writing were difficult.  My pain level was off the chart.  I had spoken with the doctor and once I did the required things at the funeral home, I took myself to the emergency room.  My pain was coming off the right lower part of my neck, affecting my vision, my appetite, my balance--basically neurologically going downhill on a fast slide since Saturday night. I told the nurse that my pain level was 20+. The Spinal Tap in the ER was negative across the board and the fluid was clear.  IV's were hung to help with hydration.  Solumedrol and methacarbornol were given IV to deal with the inflammation around the vertebrae and the pain muscle spasms. Ice packs were applied to the front and pack of the neck to not only help with swelling, but with to relieve pain and help with neck alignment.  Blood sugars were a real struggle with all the prednisone on board but were helped some with the arrival of my Frixiga from home. It was the new Neurologist in the practice that looked at my posture, listened to my history and said, I am going to get some X-rays which took all day to do.  The X-rays showed that there had been swelling and shifting to make CI and C2 put pressure on the nerve. There was also a problem with L3.  A second neurologist added a morning dose of Topomax (50mg) which began to show some effect on Tuesday after being in the hospital for 5 days.  These 2 neurologist, along with the one in the ER could not rule out that what I experienced was a delayed reaction to the Moderna Vaccination, particularly as I have had delayed reactions to allergy shots in the past. It was suggested by the radiologist that a MRI be  one for a more definitive brain study as well as a spine study but the doctor on originally was doing much and didn't pick up on that. I have had to wean off of the prednisone at home which has meant wonderful monitoring of blood sugars. I have had to continue to wear the neck collar and slowly ween out of it.  I have been exhausted--the doctors think some of that may be from the muscle spasms and the fact that it took 4 days before there was a significant decrease in the intensity in the headache.  I still have to focus on posture and my right had gets very tired of the board.

I said to myself, these are normal reactions following the vaccine.  The headache did not go away, although I took a Ibuprofen rapid tablet of 400 mg.  In the afternoon I checked my blood pressure and it was 171/90 and the pulse 86.  I took immediately additional blood pressure medicine (Captopril and Tertensif) to lower it.  In 2 hours it lowered it to 166/89 P81, at the advice of my physician, whom I called, I took the medicine I take for blood pressure Atacand and a pill to eliminate the water in the body.  Finally at 9:00 pm the blood pressure measured 149/81 P71.   On March 26 I came to work, with my blood pressure device, and at noon it was 198/94 P95.

On March 27, Saturday the blood pressure ranged between 132/74 P72 in the morning and 104/60 P 65 in the evening, taking only my usual medication for blood pressure.  And since then my blood pressure returned to normal taking only my usual treatment.      On March 29 I went to my cardiologist who examined me and did not find anything out of the ordinary, told me to continue with the same treatment, and monitor the blood pressure twice a day.

Due to the timeline of the events and the fact that his reaction progressed over the course of a couple of weeks, it seems likely that this could be a reaction from my breastmilk that contains antibodies. There is some primary literature available that describes IgA and IgE levels in breast milk over time after COVID-19 vaccination.

Precautions were taken, masks were worn, safe social distance was maintained and I have no reason to believe any of the symptoms I experienced upon returning home were related to anything other than the vaccine, particularly since first that is how vaccines work and second one of my friends who was vaccinated at the same time as me at the clinic was going through similar pains.  It started as a discomfort in my intestines or possibly just below my stomach in general. I thought my pants were too tight but just in case I let my mom take over driving the rest of the way home. When I got to the house, I had about an hour of usable time left before I went into a complete state of delirium. We're not sure how high my fever actually got before my mom woke up and checked in on me at 9:00 PM, but after having pulled the covers away I registered at 102.5� F. I was screaming in a half-awake and half-asleep nightmare, trying to get someone to come help me and unable to get anyone's attention. I would, as a result, like to insist that it be added to recommendations to not be alone after getting the vaccine! For the whole first night! I believe that I genuinely could have died. My brain was melting for lack of more proper medical terminology, and I stopped being able to understand and speak my own first language in an incredibly confused state. This was entirely a result of two simultaneous factors: Fever and Chills. First, the fever made my skin ache. Wearing any clothing hurt. But once I took off my pants in exchange for some breezy shorts, I was covered in goosebumps and feeling frozen even though it was solidly in the 70s. I claimed under blankets and still couldn't get warm enough.

I had him sit several times because I didn't know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn't breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day.

AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don't think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don't usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues.

I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can't remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn't think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn't want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I'm not sure if I had a fever, I couldn't think clearly my head felt hot). I haven't had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80�F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn't drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother & father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/10/2021,04/11/2021,1,,OTH,,,,,,,2,04/14/2021,,,,
