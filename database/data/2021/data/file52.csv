Patient endorses intermittent chest pressure over the last week in the center of the chest which is non-radiating, not worsened by inspiration.  However today patient was attempting to grab something from his fridge and had return of his pain as well as the other symptoms as noted above.  Patient has no recent periods of immobilization or recent surgeries or history of leg swelling.  No infectious symptoms reported.  We will obtain cardiopulmonary labs for further evaluation, D-dimer, TSH.  Will obtain EKG and chest x-ray.  EKG as noted above, chest x-ray is noncontributory. Patient has no leukocytosis, not anemic.  Patient has a mildly elevated creatinine of 1.4 which appears to be patient's baseline with last recorded of 1.2 on 4/8/2021.  Troponin was found to be elevated at 0.046 though with non-ischemic changes on EKG and D-dimer was found to be elevated at 21,173.  CTA was added.  BNP is negative and TSH is within normal limits. ED Course: I have assumed care of the patient from the previous provider who has discussed the clinical presentation, work-up, and ED course thus far.  I have reviewed the patient?s medical record and ED course and agree with all aspects of care thus far.  At the time of sign-out, patient had a markedly elevated D-dimer and was pending results of his CTA. Patient did have mildly elevated first troponin, mildly elevated creatinine 1.4, potassium 5.7 without hyperacute T waves or EKG changes.  Labs were otherwise fairly unremarkable.  Patient CTA ultimately returned showing a saddle embolism.  Given this finding, I will start the patient on heparin.  He is currently hemodynamically stable and does not have any hypoxia.  He is only mildly tachycardic in the low 100s.  On exam, patient does appear comfortable, does not appear short of breath or in acute distress.  I was also able to perform a bedside echocardiogram and did note that he had very mild right heart strain, but still had good squeeze.  Second troponin did come back elevated 0.866.  I contacted the inpatient hospitalist doctor and discussed the patient's presentation with him.  He does accept patient for admission to the stepdown, but is requesting that I speak with ICU.

The hives worsened and by day 3 my arms and hands were covered in huge hives. I went to a CSV Minute Clinic and was prescribed Prednisone 10mg tablets (54 of them).

It should have been up in my arm muscle and it was too low in the arm. He said it looked like it might be infected. He prescribed something but said I could wait a day or two first to see if it went away.  I waited for two days first before starting the prescription and I started using the prescription on Wednesday the 14th. My arm is starting to feel a little better today but it's itchy around the bump. He also  said that my diarrhea might have been from a flu virus - he didn't know if it was from the vaccine. The diarrhea went away on Monday, the 12th, if the afternoon.  (Note - They ran out of the vaccine and a new dose of the vaccine was needed to be obtained from Walgreens while I was waiting in line. - when the new batch came they said that this new dose was the same lot number.

Two days later, I had a severe headache, especially above my right eye, which was not much reduced with pain reliever (Tylenol). The pain persisted and I saw my long time ophthalmologist on Friday, March 26.  He noted that pressure in my right eye was 44 (approximately 3x normal) and that my cornea in that eye was swollen.  Pressure and vision test for my left eye were normal. I was already taking Latanoprost eye drops, so I was told to continue that.  In addition, he added Brimonidine Tartrate drops and Timolol Laleate drops to my treatment.  I seemed to experience some fatigue after starting drops, which improved after a few days.  However, because Dr. office did not respond to questions I submitted to office about various issues, I decided to seek a second opinion. I first saw second Dr. (information provided above) on March 31.  He agreed with first Dr.'s diagnosis and generally with the treatment, but added a diuretic and substituted Rocklatan for the latanoprost drops I had been on. When I visited Dr., the pressure in my eye had reduced to 34.  I continue on the treatment schedule and do feel much improved.  I am next scheduled to see Dr. on April 27 for follow-up.  Both Drs. do not think the vaccine caused the cornea swelling.  Dr. stated that if it were the vaccine, it would have affected both eyes.

I originally had covid 19 in December and did lose my taste and smell but it had come back 100% after 2 weeks. I had my taste and smell back and then went to go get vaccinated on 2/17/21. Friday 2/26/21 when I had ate my lunch the chicken tasted old and like it had gone bad. I thought that I had just had bad food. Turns out that was the first time that my taste seemed off. The next time I ate chicken a couple days later it tasted rancid and I had to spit it out. This started with chicken and then progressed to beef, pork, any meat. A week later it progressed to where garlic started to taste bad. Meat and Garlic have the same rancid smell to them. It then progressed to my bowel movements smelling the same way. Then progressed to always having the bad taste in the back of my mouth. About 2-3 weeks ago tap water started to smell very strongly of chemicals.  Now it has progressed to Meat, Garlic, onions, or anything in garlic family, strawberries, zucchini, peanut butter, chemical smell of water, coffee, and then just foods here and there that do not taste terrible but do not taste good either. The only foods that taste completely normal are sweets like icecream or cake. My diet is now consisting of protein bars, protein shakes, salads, chips, cheese, and sweets. It?s been challenging especially since garlic is put in 90% of all food products it feels like. If I open the container of garlic powder it can make me gag until I vomit if I smell it long enough. I did mention this to my Primary Care Doctor. She stated that she would be willing to refer me to a specialist if my symptoms persist into June or so. Right now not only are my symptoms persisting but worsening every week. I?m concerned that I will eventually run out of foods I can eat. These symptoms are still ongoing.

According to her, I was flopping around, spitting wildly and drooling all over my face, my eyes wide and glazed staring into nothing, lips turning blue.

Would barely touch food or liquids. Again slept more than usual for naps. Threw up around 5pm the small amount of food he had eaten. Overnight he had diarrhea.. he woke up in middle of night upset and I changed him, his clothes, and bedding. By morning he had more diarrhea in diaper.  Wednesday still no change in appetite. Still diarrhea that I was having to either bathe him after or change entire clothes and sheets. Was up in middle of night upset again with diarrhea.

I leave a message for nurse on call to help me diagnose symptoms of dehydration. I ask if this could be vaccine related and she said no most likely not - because it had lasted. (Side note: we have a toddler and two adults in the household as well who have still yet to get the said virus). His lips have been cherry red I guess from either not drinking enough or not feeling well.  Thursday night he woke up inconsolable. When I picked him up it was as if he didn?t realize I was there to comfort him and was just crying nearly inconsolably. I realized more diarrhea and changed everything. Got him some milk and got him calm and down.  Friday still no change. A little more appetite at dinner but then quickly out of blue was inconsolably crying for over 30 mins.

When I got up in the morning, both symptoms were gone and I assumed I made it through any side affects.  That whole day I felt great.  I had delayed my daily 7 mile run, which I normally do in the morning, to make sure the symptoms were really over.  So by 4 pm, still feeling great, I decided to go for that run.  I didn't run particularly hard or fast,  It was a relaxing, enjoyable run.  No issues.  When I got back home around 5:30 pm, I went straight back to my office to keep working.  I was feeling hot, as you would expect after a run, so I turned on the ceiling fan.  after about 15 minutes I started to feel like I was shivering from the cold, so I turned off the fan.  Within less than 5 minutes, I was shacking and my muscles were spasming uncontrollably.  It was similar to the couple of times in my life where I have gone into shock from an injury.  So I dropped everything and made my way as quick as I could to a very hot shower.  I was scared enough to ask my 17 year old daughter to check on me to make sure I don't pass out.  A couple time I thought about calling 911, but I didn't have my phone and I was afraid to leave the shower.  After about 20 minutes in the near scolding shower, I stopped shaking enough to where I decided to wrap up and get under a bunch of covers laying on the bed.  The shacking  completely stopped after 5 or 10 minutes in bed, but the fever shot up and I developed a debilitating headache.  I took Tylenol and eventually Excedrin Migraine to ease the pain.  The fevered stayed over 100 F most of the night (my normal temperature is a little above 97), and the headache remained but gradually declined.  By 7 am the this morning I was fine and I've been fine all day.  The only reasons I'm reporting this is because the shaking was very severe, at times I wondered if I was heading for a seizure, and, being a runner, I want to make sure there is not a link between severe reactions and distance running shortly after the vaccination.",,,,,,,,,Y,04/14/2021,04/15/2021,1,,PUB,,Flovent pseudoephedrine Advil,None,Exercise induced asthma (at very high levels of effort - patient is a distance runner),,,2,04/16/2021,,,,Corn Dairy

Blood came back normal and likelihood of clot very low, so was released but referred to my primary doctor and a neurologist for follow up over the next week.

After vaccination from that day until now (11Feb2021), patient still has pain on the injection site. She wanted to know if that is usual. She is concerned because she had heard that the AEs from the second dose are worse than from the first dose. Patient family doctor didn't want to entertain her concern. Her doctor said that she should refer to the one who gave the vaccine which is from the County in (State). Patient couldn't believe her doctor wouldn't want to take care of me since he said my AE is related to the vaccine. This was the weirdest thing she had from her doctor.Patient called and stated that she was am a person who received the Pfizer vaccine 16 days ago and she was experiencing still sore muscles in the arm where it was given she could not bend my arm as far as she use to be able to she cannot flex it toward her shoulders and its she just talked to her doctor's office where she told them sahe was having some adverse effects from the shot. Patient was calling to see if got any same reports of peoples whose arms got stiff, muscles are stiff, can't flex, sore, even like she say she was now 16 days after the injection she think that's a little bit long to still be feeling something. Patient also mentioned she was beginning to wonder if she going to get rid of this soreness in her arm or is that something permanent. Patient explained further when she first got it she did experience localized pain, I did not experience fever, did experience though shivering or chills but kind of thought that was because it was chilly but it might have been from the vaccine now that she think about it but she was not sure mostly it was the soreness in my arm that's her main concern is this lingering soreness in the arm after 16 days she had the injection on the 27Jan. At end of call mentioned she had seen the general side effects and may have experienced a few more other than this one but this is the one that's still with her not being able to utilize my left arm like she was used to be able to do even just reaching up to a cabinet for something in a higher cabinet or something she can't do that without feeling she was going to drop what she was reaching for and its sore its sore to do it. Reaching for a skillet down below in a lower cabinet it's like no it's not going to work or getting a gallon of milk out of the refrigerator I almost dropped it. So she feel like what was going on here I should be over this by now she can't, with both arm she use to be able to bend at the elbow and touch my shoulder well she cannot still can with my right arm but with the left arm she can't do that. She like 2 inches from being able to touch my shoulder. Fixing her hair she can't reach back behind my head very easily its with pain and effort to brush and she was left handed so maybe I shouldn't have gotten it in my left arm here I am 16 days later and she still feel like I can't utilize my arm like she use to be able to not totally disabled but know its disability in it and its annoying the pain was annoying even taking Ibuprofen.Patient really didn't have much effects, a little bit of chills but they were having cold weather, she was from (State) so she might get a chill if she opens up the windows. She really had no significant adverse effects at first except soreness in the arm, she says of the things recanted on the internet, she didn't have fever, she may have had some chills but she was lethargic, she didn't feel like doing anything, so she guesses she would say tiredness for the first day or so but what bothers her is that was 27Jan and she still does not have full use of the arm in movement. The arm used to be able to, without hesitation, reach behind her head to brush her hair or reach to fix her necklaces those things she couldn't do and she would say oh goodness what is going on. She has pain if she tries to force it and she thought well she will exercise to limber it up. She is not having continual pain like if she leaves her arm down comfortably but trying to do activity like reaching up to her shoulder or her neck or behind her head. She couldn't do that she would say the last few days it has been a little bit better but there is still pain there. Her vaccine card is in her purse she is going to be going go to the appointment in a couple of days and it scares her because she don't want to have her arm on the other side hurt, if she gets she was going to ask them to put it on the other side but she doesn't want to go through this again and what if it is permanent and both arms are then disabled she would rather have one of them working than both of them. Prior to the injection, her arm had no problem. She states she cannot touch her shoulder anymore and is unable to reach behind her neck to latch a necklace. She states now, she feels discomfort in her forearm and not as much in the upper arm. She states sometimes the pain goes into her hand; she states while she is quietly watching tv, she notices some throbbing going into her hand. She's not affected by arthritis and things like that and she's had pretty good health. She has gotten the flu and pneumonia shot and any other injections with no problem. She had a comfortable initial stick when she received the COVID vaccine with no particular pain at the time of injection. She stated she did not want to do anything for 2 days and was really tired with a stiff and sore arm. She called the doctor after 2 weeks and was not able to get ahold of a doctor.

1221406,04/16/2021,MN,36.0,36,,F,,"On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson & Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn't walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don't know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn't have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn't working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I'm feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I'm in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.",,,,,,,,,N,03/13/2021,03/13/2021,0,Mris Xrays Blood work,PVT,,Gabapentin,No,Multiple sclerosis,,,2,04/16/2021,,Y,Y,Ceclor Cyclosporins Wellbutrin Amoxicillin Naproxen

She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.

Overnight, despite the fatigue, I had trouble sleeping due to heart palpitations and intermittently feeling too hot or too cold, and eventually I had a headache. All night, I was falling asleep and waking up a little while later.  At around 6:30am on 4/15, after sleeping poorly, my headache had gotten bad enough that I decided to take acetaminophen. I had not previously taken any medicine leading up to the vaccine or after getting the shot. I got out of bed and walked across the house, and that's when the presyncope came. Feeling very faint, I sat down, took the acetaminophen, and waited for the feeling to pass.   Once the feeling did pass, I started to feel better pretty quickly, which may have been the medicine working, and then I was able to sleep for a few hours.

The shivering quickly changed to more of a convulsing and temp got up to 104.7F.  When I woke the next morning, temp was back down to 101-102F and most of shakes were subsiding.  But I noticed that I had a deep, cutaneous pain reaction from head to toe when I awoke on 3-5-21.  I could not brush my hair because my scalp was too tender.  I couldn't let anything touch me and put pressure against any part of my body.  Then at 3:30 that afternoon, I went to bathroom and had a bowel movement.  It was so excruciating that I truly though my colon might have come partially out.  I was in too much pain to flush, so I crawled across the house to my bed and laid on my side for an hour, crying.  When I was finally able to go back to the bathroom to flush, I was expecting a large BM.  It was not.  It was about 2"" x 1"" and soft.  There was no blood.  It just felt like it tore me up.   ****Then at 7:30 PM on 3-5-21 was when things got very serious.  I was sitting down watching TV after a light meal.  Suddenly, I started noticing discomfort deep in my upper back, between my shoulder blades.  Within 5 minutes, it was at its worst....I was have rated it 11/10 pain.  The pain was just very deep, behind the spine, about palm sized radius and unrelenting.  My first thought was ""maybe this is musculoskeletal since I've been in bed a lot because of the pain today.""  So I looked in my medicine cabinet for what I had and took 5 mg of Oxycodone and 10 mg of Cyclobenzaprine.  An hour later, these meds hadn't touched it.  I was beginning to really worry about an MI, or aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism (though I had no SOB).  Lying flat on my back on a hard surface seemed to provide the only relief (though minimal relief, 9/10 pain).  I called another provider who was on call and told her.  She said that I could try taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen, but if I wasn't relieved in 1 hour, I needed to call 911 or have someone take me to the ER.  I was asleep in an hour.

Then, she used the walker to back up in the bed (19Feb2021), and she seemed to be okay. It seemed like the sweats would go away and she would get the cold chills. The patient just put a heating pad on her stomach, and this occurred all day long until Saturday morning. She mentions she does have constipation problems, but this was explosive.

A Flutter in 2012, Caller also had PVCs and Bigeminy on EKG around this time and caller had a Cardiac Ablation for treatment. Caller stated that she had a history of A. Flutter, related to Pneumonia that she had back in 2012, because some of the medications for the Pneumonia threw her heart out of sync. Caller states that she did have a cardiac ablation because the A. Flutter was proximal. Caller states that it took a while for the doctor's to diagnose her because it would only occur every once in a while, and just for a few seconds. Caller states that on EKG she was having PVCs and Bigeminy, but it never really picked up the A. Flutter, but of course the caller could feel the PVCs.

She had chronic allergies. Caller stated that if her normal allergy medicines work, then she knew she was just having sinus allergies, but right now, caller stated her allergies are acting up. Caller reports that her symptoms started two to three days ago. Caller states that yesterday (25Feb2021), she had trouble breathing, but caller does have a history of allergy induced asthma. Caller states that she just had her windows replaced and she is allergic to pollen so she thought the dust being kicked up by her windows being replaced may have been the culprit of her symptoms, but she went to the doctor because she knew she had a sinus infection, and she also had some symptoms that are not typical of her sinus infections, including chills and body aches. Caller states that she told her doctor to test her for COVID, even though she has had both doses of the vaccine. Caller's COVID test came back positive. Caller states that she is a nurse herself, and she works in a hospital that is considered a COVID hospital. Caller does not work bedside but she does see some outpatient patients, as she is an anesthesia coordinator, and they do COVID testing on patients prior to their procedures. Caller reports that she had the COVID-19 Rapid test today, with the nasal swab. Caller states that it was a gut instinct on her part to ask for the test because she didn't think her symptoms felt real different from her normal chronic allergies and sinus issues, but she is sleepy and tired, she is having muscle aches and chills and a slight fever. Caller states that yesterday, she had a hard time breathing, and even though she does have allergy induced asthma, it seemed that even with inhalers, she was not able to breath normally. Caller states that the worst day of her symptoms was yesterday (26Feb2021), and today she feels a little bit better with her breathing.

The extreme pain lasted until my second shot (about a week). When going for my second shot, I reported a rash with hives on my lower abdomen that had appeared within five hours of my first shot, so they requested I stay a little longer for observation. That night I began having some breathing difficulties, but assumed they were to be expected. The breathing difficulties continued to get worse until my nurse practitioner told me to go directly to the nearest ER (2/16/21), where I was officially diagnosed with multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms. I was admitted to healthcare facility for 24-48 hours, until an EKG revealed heart abnormalities that caused them to use a physician's transport to move me to another unit. I was discharged from the hospital on 2/2/21 after I stabilized from heparin shots, avoiding more invasive procedures. I have been in ongoing recovery since then, receiving ongoing care from a hematologist and pulmonologist.

It would seem there was no mention of migraines as a side affect. So figured it best to report just in case it was a sign of something more. The floaters and flashes were similar to those I have gotten prior to migraine headaches. This was unusual as normally they normally  do not interrupt my vision greatly and are simply in my vision and usually only in one eye. In this case it wasn't limited to one eye or one spot.. there were multiple and made it hard to focus and see. Usually when I get visual migraines, a headache comes shortly after. So far as of this writing, I only feel a tinge of a migraine coming on, but it is seeming to fade already.  Should note, I do not get migraines often (maybe once every other year or so.. ) and when I do it is usually after extended exposure to the sun and not on a chilly morning when I first wake up.

I talked with my physician prior to getting the vaccine due to medical conditions and medications that I am taking. I was taking Xarelto due to chronic DVT/Blood clots in my left leg.   After 2.5 weeks I noted my left leg was swelling and I started to have discomfort in my leg. No noticeable changes to my leg at this time that made me concerned about getting the second vaccine.   3/30 - I received my second vaccination in the morning. I ended up going into the hospital at 4 pm due to numbness and pain in my left leg. I ended up being admitted to the hospital due to a DVT behind my L knee and in my femoral/iliac veins. I was also diagnosed with May-Thurbers syndrome. All the physicians, hematologists, and surgeons were surprised that I ended up with a severe blood clot as I was on Xarelto for over two years without an incident or problem. I did not have a fall or any change in my life that would have caused this issue to happen and they were all stumped.  I was switched to a heparin drip while Xarelto was clearing out of my system and in two days I had two stints put in my femoral/iliac vein on my left leg.  I was changed over to Lovenox and Coumadin 5-7.5 mg before leaving the hospital. There were no concerns and I was in the hospital from 3/30 to 4/3/21.  After I was discharged from the hospital I went to my primary care follow up on Tuesday 4/6/21. I was having increased pain behind my knee and overall not feeling well. I ended up having more labs completed and another ultrasound to indicate I had a small DVT behind my knee from my procedure.   On Friday 4/9/21 I went in for my INR and found my coumadin was within therapeutic range. When I got home I changed into comfy clothing and noted that I had a red/purplish rash looking dots/bumps from my toes to my knees on both LE, my Left was more significant than my right. I went back into the doctor and I was prescribed a topical steroid to help decrease the edema, pain and redness.   Saturday 4/10/21 - my legs became painful to the touch, they felt like they were going to burst due to pressure, and the rash/reddness was looking worse and spreading. I was sent back to the ER and was admitted back to the hospital. They diagnosed me with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, removed me off of coumadin, and started me on Arixtra. The hematologist, physicians and staff did not know what to do and I was now deemed medically complex and had to be monitored for a few days and gave me prednisone. Once removed from coumadin the rash/pain/swelling subsided and started to diminish. I was discharged from the hospital.  I returned to work on Tuesday 4/13 and after returning home I had increased pain, pressure and rash that now was visible from my knees to my hips and this was not present in the hospital. My physician is asking for a biopsy and increased my prednisone to stay at 20 mg a day.  At night I have to elevate my legs or they become swollen and will become painful.   4/16/21 I wore compression tights per physician guidelines and when I came home from work I had new spots and rashes on my feet, they were swollen and had increased pain. My left ankle had a rash on it as well. After elevation and a nights rest the rash started to diminish and the rest of my legs have started to diminish or disappear.",,,Y,,Y,8,,Y,N,03/02/2021,03/30/2021,28,"March 30th Potassium, Troponin I, COVID 19, Magnesium, Protime, Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC with Auto Differential, Nucleated red blood cells, APTT, US venous lower extremity left,  EKG 12 lead, CT chest PE Study, Scan-cardiac strip March 31 Basic Metabolic panel, APTT, CBC with auto differential, Nucleated red blood cells, Troponin April 6 Protime, S Venous Lower Extremity Left, CBC with auto differential April 10 Nucleated red blood cells, CBC with auto differential, basic metabolic panel, reticulocytes, protime, IGG specific Heparin antibodies, urinalysis, UA w/sediment exam, US Arterial BLE, US venous BLE April 11 Staclot LA, DRVVT confirm,  beta 2 glycoprotein 1 ABY IGA IGM IGG, Cardiolipin antibody, Hepatic Function panel, Sedimentation rate, ANA test, Lupus anticoagulant",WRK,,"Lexapro, Wellbutrin XL, Xarelto,  Magnesium, Prevacid",None,Chronic DVT - protein S deficiency and Factor 5.

However, the vaccinator neglected to check his date of birth in the system to confirm it.  The patient's mother was in the room but was not present at the vaccination station where he was seated.  Believing the patient was an adult, the vaccinator walked two tables away to retrieve a dose of Moderna and vaccinated the patient with it.  Within minutes our team recognized that we had one dose too many of Pfizer and one too few of Moderna and we realized what had happened.   The patient had absolutely no adverse reaction whatsoever but this error was quite disconcerting to my entire team.  This incident was fully discussed afterwards with the patient's mother who, interestingly, appeared pleased that he had received the Moderna vaccine as his whole family already had as well.

My upper back and my left underarm area on my torso towards my back began to hurt and become extremely sensitive to touch.

I initially went to the doctor on April 14th, 2021 after dealing with this pain that was getting progressively worse. I feared that I was having a pulmonary embolism or a cardiac event, and maybe even a problem with my spleen.

Over the course of the next 3 days, the rash became a cluster of blisters, I developed severe shooting pains from my left breast into my under arm area and around my back along the left side. My spine in my upper back began to feel bruised, along with my sternum which feels bruised and inflamed internally. I've been so uncomfortable that I've been having trouble sleeping. The pain also worsens after I eat, which makes eating really difficult. I made a second doctor's appointment for today, April 17th, 2021 (I was unable to get a sooner appointment) .

I?d had a similar wheal on my arm a few days after the first shot (given 3/19), so seeing another one now makes me believe it may be connected to the vaccine. The wheal is below the injection site (about 7 o?clock if you?re standing looking at the injection site) and seems to be raised like a bump and is both hot and tender to the touch . It is unlike my normal wheals in location (more commonly I get them on the underside of my forearm), size, and characteristics, and because it is NOT itchy like they usually are. The wheal on my face was darker than usual, more a wine than bright red, and not in a typical location (it was high on the cheekbone just under my right eye; I most often get one on the left cheekbone near my nose).

It was reported that the patient vision wasn't as good. She also had glasses to read (eyeglass wearer and ongoing) and behind her eyes they were dry one (left) mostly. Concomitant medications included unspecified beta blockers. On 11Mar2021, she got chills on the same day. Right as she got the shot, she wanted to vomit also and got shaky. On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn't as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn't as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn't even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn't know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn't get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that's happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There's pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn't. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that's weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced.

I was walking and felt a bit odd just because I almost immediately tasted a metal taste in my mouth and commented on it and something seemed ""off."" As I kept walking it off, the pharmacist came to check up on me but I was still trying to figure out what was wrong. Over the next 15 minutes, I had a ""heavy knee"" feeling under both knee caps at the same time, tingling on the bottom of both feet at the same time like they were placed against a jet and both jaws tightened in one location...not at the TMJ but lower....like where my jaws misaligned from the accident. And then heavy eye brows would hit. And they wouldn't stay like this. It would come and go. Come and go. Not in seconds but 10 minute intervals or something? But I definitely was starting to feel more ""nervy."" Not prickly. Not pain. Just random sharp here and there or feeling like I could feel a nerve ""wake up"" here and there. Also, my hips/pelvis. On both sides at the same time they would not ache but get tight or say HI in a weird way but more towards the glute/pelvis region; it was an odd location. Also. My lower back was tight. It got really tight. That was the most annoying thing. It stayed tight. Also, my right shoulder/neck that had been locked up and inflammed from a flare-up...the pain disappeared just like my head pain. (The nerve issues sometimes felt like when I took rizaptriptan the first few times and I could feel the nerve then too.   Due to being used to weird nerve issues since the accident, I was concerned but not enough to go to the hospital and just wanted to wait it out. I had plans of going home and working out and doing my therapy and stretches.   I got home and within 45 minutes of the vaccine my face was starting to feel cold. I was feeling nervy all over. And then my spinal cord lit up, just once, like electrifying....not painful....but like electricity....like nerve. A large section of it just lit up and then that was it. I didn't have any odd movements with it. It just lit up.   Also, my head. There was a spot on the top of my head near the ""soft spot"" that I kept feeling a nerve burst. Like, as if I could feel the tendrils of the end of a nerve. It would just light up once and stop. Then light up and stop. It had stopped by the time I went to bed.   I worked out and had no issues. I haven't had any more spinal cord issues. I went to my scheduled accupuncture appointment today and it settled some of what was still in my hands. I worked all day as well in retail with no issues. I haven't had any more issues with the ""heavy feeling"" and my lumbar region was fine by bedtime. My feet are fine now. I am having nerve issues now but it's hard to say if it's my normal issues or still aggravated by the vaccine.   I'm having zero flu symptoms or anything from the vaccine they reported I may have. My arm at the injection site has no welt, redness, I can't find it, and is sore but it's like being hit by a softball. On the pain scale I'm used to: it's a 1/10.

Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case.

The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting.

Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient's A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital.

The patient stated it was like she couldn't even make that stress come up. She felt like she was high on 12Mar2021. She's not the type of person to do drugs, she just states if she was a person that was high. It was reported that her door is looking further away from her.

Her teeth felt weak; tooth actually broke on 12Mar2021:  actually in the front, she stated it felt like if she's biting something, but when she says her teeth felt weak, her tooth actually broke that day in the back, just like that, when she was eating a tortilla chip. The patient stated her eyes were dry and mucousy on 12Mar2021. Her reading vision was less on 12Mar2021, her eyes, were weak to watch TV, the doors were far away and wavy, dense-like.

The patient stated she started having dry skin, itching. The patient stated she also was expecting to drop some weight because she was watching what she ate and she was definite that she was going to lose weight.

The patient stated her tooth is still broken, but it doesn't bother her, it just has a sharp edge. The patient stated no mucus is in the way of her reading vision anymore, it's improved. The patient stated she had mucus in her eye, had problems watching TV, her reading vision at times is clear. The patient stated she is trying to remember what she read, she does remember the reading being bothersome, or maybe that was with the high. The patient stated she was just so zoned into her reading. The patient stated the high has gone away, but the calm, that part is the only thing that has not gone away. The patient stated she's still very calm.

The patient's medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn't remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn't even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn't take any types of ""cillins"" medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she's noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn't feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it's going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she's not even doing anything. She hasn't even worked out yet. She doesn't like to take medicine. Medications don't work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she's fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it's been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She's been reporting online. Clarified she's reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She's been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband's cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She's also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband's heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn't messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she's standing completely still. Then she'll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she's been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it's going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she's never had her heartrate go down that far, it's really really weird. She thinks maybe she'll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s. Now the device says possible atrial fibrillation. It was further reported that she received the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm because she has bursitis in her right.

She stated that the muscles would be across the top shelf of her breast above the start of cleavage and under her arms on the outer sides of her breast, underneath her shoulder blades and to her spine things are getting better but she was not perfect and is still hurting and now is lucky if she can reach to grab her diet soda; overweight from an unknown date, and tooth infection from Mar2021 (probably about 6 days before getting the vaccine and is taking Clindamycin 300mg capsules and takes it three times per day).

The fever was last night and she got paracetamol (TYLENOL) for that and brought it down. It did respond. The patient stated she can't breathe through her nose and she has upper respiratory problems. The problem was when they went to the hospital, they didn't find signs of infections, all normal across the board. The patient doesn't fake it, she was a feisty elderly lady.

She wasn't feeling good on Saturday night, but not too bad on Friday night. Reporter asked her mom how she felt on Friday. Reporter told her mom to put in her hearing aids, that would probably help. Reporter further explained that patient had a sore arm around the injection site and that she might not have been feeling that great.

A 66 -year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. She provided a brief history from 2017. She was walking her dog and she fell and suffered a concussion, she had a seizure, then she developed bipolar disorder. She's been taking sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) for her seizures since 2017. She reports she's very active. She's not an old lady. She can run circles around some 22 year old's. In September of 2017, she had a concussion and had seizures. She's been on sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) since that time. She's not mentally ill, the concussion she got in 2017 caused her brain to turn bipolar. It's hard for people to understand that. Sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) was 500mg. She takes 1 tablet in the morning and 2 tablets at night because it can make you sleepy. She reports she was recently hospitalized in Feb2021 for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). Her heartrate was 181 beats per minute, her blood pressure was dropping, she tested positive for rhinovirus and the doctor thinks the atrial fibrillation with RVR was caused from the rhinovirus. She was allergic to bee venom and carries an EPI PEN. Medical history also included ongoing high blood pressure from an unspecified date (controlled with medication). Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) taken for blood pressure; ongoing lisinopril; ongoing valproate semisodium (DEPAKOTE) taken for seizure from 2017; ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL HCTZ) taken for blood pressure; paracetamol (TYLENOL) from an unspecified date in 2021. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9810; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021). The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions or any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported; or any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient reported that with the second Covid 19 vaccine she had two seizures on 27Mar2021. The seizures were back to back. The seizures resolved within 2 minutes. She had fatigue from an unspecified date, sore muscles and a wrap around headache on 26Mar2021. The wrap around headache felt like she was going to have a stroke even though her blood pressure was fine. She monitored her blood pressure at her home. She feels it's weird that they publish that the second Covid 19 vaccine is going to be worse. She thought she'd have muscle soreness and fatigue but not seizures. She looked it up and the wrap around headache and seizure are the rarest things that can happen after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She stayed in bed from Friday afternoon after she received the second Covid 19 vaccine on 26Mar2021 and started to feel better Sunday afternoon, 28Mar2021. Her blood pressure and pulse were both fine with her wrap around headache. She had fatigue with both Covid 19 vaccines. She also developed hives, which she still has. She has a rash from her head to her toes. It looked like she rolled around in an ant bed. The hives were clearing up. She was using an anti-itch cream. The hives and the rash started midday on Saturday, 27Mar2021. She only has around 5 hives now on her chest. She hasn't taken Benadryl. She doesn't like to take it. Her doctor didn't want her to open the hives and cause impetigo. She never had any soreness in her arm. She doesn't think the headache was serious because she had a blood pressure cuff at home. She just knew the hives and the rash were a reaction to the Covid 19 vaccine. She didn't go to the hospital for her seizures. She was not seen in the Emergency Department, hospitalized, or admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. She tries to do holistic medicines and treatments. She doesn't run to the hospital every time something happens. She tries to stay out of the hospital. She's fine now and she loves Pfizer. If she can get a medicine she needs that Pfizer makes she tries to get it. She tries to see every side of things. Outcome of seizures was recovered on 27Mar2021 and sore muscles was recovered on 28Mar2021; of remaining events was recovering.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

This 84-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2019 and ongoing, when she would sleep her oxygen would drop, and shrunk from 5 feet 5 1/4 inches to now 5 feet 2 inches. She never found out why her oxygen saturations dropped at night but she does not have sleep apnea. Her saturations would drop down to the 80s and she would still be sleeping. Concomitant medications included ongoing albuterol [salbutamol] taken for asthma and oxygen taken for ""when she would sleep her oxygen would drop"" from 2012 and ongoing. Patient previously took Anoro and Qvar in Aug2019. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 25Feb2021 (lot number: EN6206, NDC:59267-1000-01, Expiry date unknown) in the left arm. With the first vaccine she did not have any symptoms, she thought she got saline. Only symptoms she felt were when they told her to wait 15 minutes and she sat there and when she got up and she was driving and had her window down her nose felt like it was swelling. She lost her sense of smell due to an injury and she had an acute sense of smell of tobacco from the car next to her. That is the only symptom she had. The acute sense of smell was about 30 minutes after she got her injection, about 5-7 minutes after that. She left about 10:30 am and it happened around 10:35-10:37 am. The acute sense of smell was short lived, it happened for a minute or two. Several years ago she had shoulder surgery and had her great granddaughter and she was playing with her and her foot got caught in the coffee table and she fell and her nose got cut and lost her sense of smell. When asked for seriousness criteria, patient stated it was significant because she had not been able to smell since 2011 and she had the sensation of her nose swelling. She felt like that but she was driving and could not look at her nose. She didn't have the feeling 15 minutes after the vaccine, she had been driving for 5-7 minutes and had the feeling and it was exactly when she got in the car. It was significant because she was able to smell something. Patient had her second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Mar2021 and had shortness of breath. She suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she's had now. She did not seem to be getting better and the slightest movement, she's short of breath. She is taking the medicine that she normally takes but never had to take it this much. She was short of breath and not paying that much attention to it, when she goes out she wears a mask, since last year, and she went to put the trash out and had shortness of breath stepping out the back door. She was talking to a friend long distance and she told her she was so short of breath. To get out of bed and turn in bed she's more short of breath. The shortness of breath may have started before Friday 26Mar2021 but that's when she noticed it. She would have her mask on, park her car and go to the post office and when she would walk to her PO box, which is the first of the boxes, she was exhausted and not getting enough air and she noticed it. But then when she went outside to put the trash out, just a step outside she was short of breath, that's when she began to notice. She has never been this short of breath and her breathing and exchange of air has never been this bad. She thought she would maybe get her smell back and in all the years she's been diagnosed with asthma she's never had the wheezing and shortness of breath that she's had now. She's never heard herself wheeze. Monday night she was up at 3 am and got up to go to the bathroom and she was so short of breath. She had to take it at 3:30 am and that had never happened to her. She never had wheezing until the second vaccine. She doesn't need a stethoscope to hear the wheezing and that most people have asthma with wheezing but she did not. Patient was not taking the Qvar until after the second dose of the vaccine and was only using the albuterol before. She would take two puffs in her car and then put two masks before getting out. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No AE required a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was scheduled to see her primary doctor on 13Apr2021 but could not get in earlier and attempted to see her pulmonary doctor and the earliest she can is 07Apr2021 and she has that appointment. Patient was also very hoarse. From time to time medications like her inhaler for her asthma sometimes makes her hoarse. This time she has the hoarseness even when she doesn't take her inhaler. She has audible wheezing. She would not consider the shortness of breath life threatening but it is concerning because she is not able to do what she needs to do because she doesn't have the energy. Hoarseness is worsening because she is taking more of the medications she's normally taking and now she is taking the inhaler twice a day because she is more short of breath. The one inhaler she is using is Qvar. She has been taking the albuterol more also. Hoarseness is not life threatening, it is effective but it is not disabling. The more she talks, the more hoarse she gets. Relatedness of drug to reactions shortness of breath, very hoarse, by primary source reporter (Method of assessment: Global Introspection) was related. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender's Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Asthma aggravated and Shortness of breath cannot be excluded.

Caller states after the shot she has torn meniscus in her knees and her knees were so tight and she has heel spurs, and they were burning and hurt. Caller states she hurt her hand previously and her hand was tight, and it felt like it was going to explode. Caller states every injury she has ever had it felt like it was exacerbated and got worse. Caller states she was instructed by the Clinic to take Tylenol every 6 hours and these symptoms lasted for 12 days.

The caller would like to know if there have been any reports of low blood sugar associated with receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The caller wants to know if anyone has reported seizures as a side effect from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Responded per page 23 of the attached EUA Prescribing Information LAB-1457-6.0 Revised: 25Feb2021: ""Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuroinflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. 6.2 Post Authorization Experience: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Immune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema)"". The caller has her best friend on the line with her  in case the caller forgets something. The caller's is calling on behalf of her mother who had both doses of the covid vaccine. The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit. The patient was supposed to go home from a rehabilitation facility on 27Mar2021 and staff found the patient on 26Feb2021 unresponsive but breathing on her bi-pap. Prior to the patient being found like this she was tired at noon and asked the staff to hold her lunch for her because she was tired and wanted to lay down because she had been up late the previous night. When physical therapy and occupational therapy came in a couple of hours later to do therapy they found the patient unresponsive and the patient's blood sugar was 35 so they gave her glucose and the blood sugar came up to 111. Emergency medical services came and took the patient to the emergency room and then she was put in the Intensive Care Unit, this was all within 30 minutes. The glucose dropped one more time and she started having seizures. The medical staff stabilized the patient with Keppra and another seizure medicine that starts with a V on a drip. The patient has been off her sedatives since Tuesday and she has eye movement under the eyes, she withdraws from pain, and when (name withheld) was talking to the patient on speakerphone the patient moved her head towards the phone. The caller mentions that the patient was not protecting her airway when the emergency medical service showed up and so the staff placed a king airway and then the patient moved to a normal ventilator. Wednesday the patient was being weaned on the ventilator and was able to breathe on her own for 7 hours. The caller was only able to breathe on her own on the ventilator for 2 hours yesterday, split up into 2 different trials. The medical team is pressuring the caller talking about tracheostomy and peg tubes and the medical staff wants to talk about that next week if the patient is not coming around. Investigations: MRI showed basically an assault from something that happened with the brain from having a low blood sugar. The patient has no history with diabetes or low blood sugars. Maybe the patient had a seizure prior? The patient had signs of infections, her white blood cell count is nothing crazy. The patient's lumbar puncture showed proteins and white blood cells present. The caller is trying to figure out what may have caused this incident. The patient had 4 strokes on her left side and has come back from that and has been driving and fine after. The patient's outpatient neuro person said it is from the seizures. The caller is trying to rule out if there is anything weird with this vaccine that may have caused this or been reported? PRESS is a rare complication after back surgery and the patient had that. If something is super weird and rare then the patient usually has it, she usually gets weird things. Is this related to the vaccine? The caller knows it may not be likely but it was the only thing she hadn't looked into yet.

The vaccination facility type was a warehouse. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and no following prior vaccinations. Medical history included covid-19 in Nov2020. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 on 31Mar2021 and 12 hours later (on 01Apr2021), sore arm, fever, chills and headache. Got a swollen lymph node in armpit, same arm as injection left side, today tip of left ring finger turned white and numb. She thinks it was Reynauds phenomenon. The patient called and told nurse in her doctor's office and they said if it was painful, it could be a pain clot. It was painful at first, that lymph node started 24 hours later with a sharp pain, and then she just assumed it could be a lymph node. Swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and it was very sore. The nurse told the patient to call Pfizer. The patient was fine until the tip of her finger happened. The patient said If it was painful it could be a blood clot, would need an x ray and asked if did the shot cause this. The complete ring finger left hand, the patient looked it up and it said it could happen to her feet and she looked, and her feet were modeled red, blue it was bizarre. Never happened before. The patient was not happy about getting the vaccine, she already had covid in November of last year (2020). The patient wouldn't have called if it wasn't for her finger. Not just her feet, her hands got like this too. The patient didn't want to get the second shot. The patient asked if there was any information or mandate on timing information for the second dose, should she needed to postpone it. The patient asked if what was the efficacy after first dose as she felt like she was immune because she had the virus and now the vaccine. She was very hesitant to get the Covid 19 vaccine. She thinks her body created Covid 19 antibodies. A couple days ago she was very sick. The swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and could be a blood clot as far as she knows (in 2021). Even putting on deodorant she can tell it's there, it was very sore and there's a lump. Today (on 01Apr2021), she noticed the tip of her finger got white it was numb. She looked it up online and she thinks it was Reynaud's phenomenon. She has a picture if Pfizer needed it. The finger was on the same arm that she received her vaccine in. It was the ring finger on left hand. Once it started happening her finger felt funny and felt numb. She put her finger under warm water. She reported that the white color was maybe a third of the way down towards her knuckle. She was asking if this was normal or has this been reported. She had called her doctor today and spoke with the nurse who told her to call the CDC and report her symptoms. She needed her glasses trying to give her primary care doctor's phone number. The patient wanted to add that she has something like gout in her foot and on that side too, the left foot, it was pulsing and throbbing all night. She's had this pain in her left foot, she thinks its gout because it was all the symptoms of gout and she had it for a while, it hurts off and on but that night it was hurting and throbbing. She has not been diagnosed with gout in that left foot. She still has a headache but today she felt good except for her finger turning white and going numb. The lymph node in her armpit hurts. Her doctor's nurse told her if its painful to the touch it could be a blood clot so she was nervous about that. The tip of her finger was completely white and the rest of her hands were blue and red and white and yellow. She reported that her finger was back to normal now. She didn't want to get too inoculated since she also had the Covid 19 virus. The events did not require visit to emergency room nor physician office.

She thinks that the hypersensitivity to light has improved a little  bit but it's still a problem. The hypersensitivity to light was the absolute worst on 20Mar2021. She doesn't know how much she is still dizzy when asked if it was still ongoing. She added she has been taking Benadryl and ginger for the dizziness and nausea and it helps a lot.She has been taking ginger for the nausea, and if she still has a little, it's not as much.Today is an overcast day and that it's an easy day for her.  Caller reported that  bright, sunny days are the worst.She was unsure of when the vision loss occurred but stated that she knew by 20Mar2021 that she had lost vision. She didn't know if she was continuing to lose vision but she can tell she lost vision. She did have a headache in the evening on 16Mar2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. She thinks the headache occurred in the evening on 16Mar2021.She may have had some headaches between 16Mar2021 and 20Mar2021, but that the headache she had on 20Mar2021 was a horrible headache.She is still getting headaches.  She would say the headaches are a little better but she is still having them.She is having headaches that she doesn't think she would normally have.  She wasn't having headaches before receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.She thinks she did have headaches between 16Mar2021 and 20Mar2021, but 20Mar2021 is when the headaches really hit her.The chest pain is intermittent and that the chest pain coincides with when the light is affecting her.  When it's UV light, more so in the afternoon on sunny days, but technically the artificial light in the evening some days bothers her too.She doesn't think her lymph nodes were bothering her before 29Mar2021. Her lymph nodes are ok this morning, 31Mar2021.Different organs have hurt at different times. The effect on organs started within minutes of  getting the Covid-19 vaccine.She could feel her eyes and that her eyes felt different within minutes of getting the Covid-19 vaccine. It felt like the Covid-19 vaccine was hydrating her eyes on 16Mar2021 but at the time it felt good. Afterward she was freaking out because she was concerned about her eyes.In the evening of 16Mar2021, it seemed like there was a film on her eyes and she had a headache.On 17Mar2021, 18Mar2021, and 19Mar 2021 she had headaches that she wouldn't have normally had.On 20Mar2021 different organs started hurting.Her biggest concern was the chest pain. After looking back on it, the chest pain may have started between 17Mar2021 and 19Mar2021 also.The effect on her organs from the Covid-19 vaccine occurs on different organs at different times on different days. The effect today isn't bad because it overcast outside and that her organs are really affected when she is exposed to a lot of light.She had 2 blood tests yesterday at her primary care doctor. The doctor ordered labs for VEGF and Leptin. She doesn't get vaccines.No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event Photophobia, Nausea, Headache, Lymph node disorder was recovering; other events was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed.

If she moves, her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 drops with the slightest little movement. Her oxygen has been dropping into the 70s and she has to do the pursed lips breathing to recover. It's taking a while to recover. She has to really work to get her oxygen back into the 90s. That started last week some time. She did call her doctor and her doctor prescribed prednisone and doxycycline (Prednisone 4, 10 mg tablets for 3 days, then 3 tablets for 3 days, then 2 tablets for 3 days, then 1 tablet for 3 days and Doxycline Hyclate 100mg 1 capsule twice daily for 7 days). She forgot to mention that her left leg hurts from her knee to her hip on unspecified date in 2021. That started a couple days ago. She didn't have any problems with her hip before. She's scared because the second vaccine is more potent, it's worse. She doesn't know if she's going to get that second Covid 19 vaccine.

The patient's medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy's Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor's. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn't go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn't looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it's a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor's office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn't really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn't take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work.

This healthcare professional reported information for both mother and fetus/baby. This is a mother (patient) report.  A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), first dose (batch: EL9262) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 29-years-old) then second dose (lot: EN6201) on 18Feb2021 (at the age of 29-years-old); both via an unspecified route of administration as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included blood clot (during her previous pregnancy); pulmonary embolism (during her previous pregnancy) and pregnancies (previous pregnancies were kind of close together). Concomitant medication included enoxaparin sodium (LOVENOX) for blood clot prophylaxis/pulmonary embolism prophylaxis (patient had a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism, during her previous pregnancy and so they make her prophylactically take it, always has been on it. The patient had a blood clot and was breastfeeding so she did enoxaparin sodium and she got pregnant again and was still on enoxaparin sodium). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 on 22Jan2021, and the second dose on 18Feb2021. She was pregnant at the time, subsequently developed pre-eclampsia on 22Mar2021, and delivered on 25Mar2021, 7 weeks before her due date. The patient's seriousness for preeclampsia was hospitalization from 22Mar2021 to 28Mar2021 and life threatening. The patient stated that they delivered the baby and the overall preeclampsia has resolved. The patient's blood pressure remains somewhat elevated and heart rate was severe, intermittently in Mar2021 with seriousness of medically significant and hospitalization from 22Mar2021 to 28Mar2021. The patient had a doctor appointment at a maternal fetal medicine on 22Mar2021 then from there she was delivered because her blood pressure and heart rates continued to worsen. The patient still has increased blood pressure, but she never had any blood pressure issues, just mild. The patient's blood pressure remained somewhat elevated and heart rate remained very elevated, but she couldn't say there was still protein in the urine (in 2021). The patient stated that her heart rate and blood pressure improved, and were medically significant. The patient remained on the dose and then her heart rate went up, not her blood pressure, just her heart rate went up really high starting in February, beginning of March and they increased her dose to, maybe in March, beginning of March, her heart rate went up, had her on enoxaparin sodium at 100mg once daily as her prophylactic dose and changed and went up from that to 100mg twice daily by injection. The patient stated that she may have weighed a little more (in 2021). The last weight was with pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. The patient weighed 205 (unspecified date). The patient was pregnant so she was seeing more of her maternal/fetal medicine and OB, but had seen her primary care throughout, maybe once. The patient stated that they didn't have enough data on pregnancy and neonatal and she wanted to contribute and advance knowledge in her area by providing information. The patient got the vaccination just on her own, just wanted to protect herself and her baby, the benefits outweighed the risks so she proceeded to get the vaccine. The outcome of the events blood pressure increased and heart rate abnormal was recovered in 2021; for pre-eclampsia was recovered with sequel on 25Mar2021 while for the remaining events was unknown. The patient did not believe the pre eclampsia had anything to do with the vaccine. The patient was not indicating that the vaccination led to the pre-eclampsia, that's for Pfizer to determine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: Based on the current available information, the events Pre-eclampsia, Blood pressure increased, and Heart rate increased are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination may provide a plausible explanation for the events. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

The patient received the vaccine on 13Mar2021 in the afternoon and within 24 to 30 hours, the next day (14Mar2021), her right arm, where the vaccine was administered turned all red and swollen and her elbow also hurt. She went to the emergency room because she felt it was a reaction to the vaccine. They told her that it was a bacterial skin infection, an adverse effect of an initial encounter to the vaccine, arm swelling and bursitis caused by that, muscle pain and join pain in elbow and then she guessed it was like cellulitis. They gave her ROCEPHIN at the emergency room and then a couple days later, it wasn't getting any better and it was all the way down to her wrist. She went to immediate care center and received an antibiotic. She was also given 2 more prescription of antibiotics and told that it had to be administered with the antibiotics to get rid of the reactions. It has finally pretty much cleared up with the antibiotics if they hadn't put her in an immediate care and put her on intravenous medications. They were really concerned because it was going to get into sepsis or something. At first, the patient thought that it was just inflamed, then it was skin infection and then adverse effect from the initial encounter of the vaccine. She had been on the antibiotics for 10 days when it finally cleared, but the elbow was still sore and it hurts a lot, but the fluid was drained by an orthopedic doctor. She was given 2 different types of antibiotics plus a shot into her buttocks. It's a little sore because she was informed that ""the bruise have been flamed"" on Mar2021. When she went to emergency, first they give her 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched antibiotic to DURICEF and to BACTRIM DS, and advised to continue monitoring and if swelling and redness was progressive or worse, then go to emergency room again. She went to emergency room on 16Mar2021, the medicine given was doxycycline and then she was seen by an orthopedic physician today where the fluid was drained from her elbow but swelling and redness was progressively getting worst and she was feeling hot on Mar2021. So, she went to the immediate care. Overall, consistent to cellulitis of right upper arm strongly includes to go to the ER but the patient had something else and had to go right then. And then, she was given 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched to DURACEF and BACTRIM. She came back to the ER on the same day. It was kind of 2 things, like the redness and skin infection which currently was cellulitis. Doxycycline was what they told her to get, that's what they gave her at the emergency room, doxycycline hyclate. And then said to follow-up with her primary care which she did and that was on 17Mar2021. She looked at it and then they told her to see an orthopedic surgeon and she saw him on the 18Mar2021. They just thought that the antibiotics, that's why he gave her 2 different prescriptions plus the shot in the buttocks because he said if this will not be cured with the antibiotics, she'll end up in a hospital. And then it was raft and it took her 10 days to recover. And he marked little black dots to show where wasn't and if it goes beyond that then call us because it was spreading.
