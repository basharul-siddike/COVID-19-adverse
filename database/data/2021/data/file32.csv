Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient's pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge > To call if any return of symptoms > To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load > Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   > To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram > Follow up in clinic when return from break > Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion",,,,,Y,1,,,Y,03/10/2021,03/10/2021,0,,OTH,,"acyclovir, cetirizine, chloecalciferol, eliquis, everolimus, fluconazole, magnesium oxide, metformin-XR, pantoprazole, pravastatin, predniSONE, MVI, Bactrim, tacrolimus, tamsulosin",,"Lung Cancer (adenocarcinoma L Lung, lung nodules, bronchoalveolar carcinoma); S/P Lung transplant; GERD; high cholesterol; history antineoplastic therapy, hemoptysis, hydropneumothorax, steroid induced hyperglycemia, DVT, abnormal thyroid",,,2,03/15/2021,,,,NKDA

I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021.

At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen.

At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.

On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21.

Like I said it was going up and down. I considered calling 911 but a nurse suggested I just monitor it as they would not do anything at the hospital but monitor me.  On Monday I stayed in contact with my cardiologist and these symptoms lasted till Wednesday morning. Since then everything has been great.

Patient has presumed epilepsy and nonepileptic psychogenic seizures.  He started to have a cluster of seizures after getting COVID19 vaccine.

Additional electrodes used included T1, T2, and extraocular electrodes, and ECG, along with video recording. The EEG was recorded with the patient awake, drowsy, and asleep state. This study was intermittently monitored by a monitoring technologist.  The physician interpreting the study had access to the data throughout the recording.  The recording was technically satisfactory.     Findings:  Background Activity:  The background is grossly symmetric with respect to voltages and activities. During wakefulness, the background is extremely low voltage, but appears to be organized with diffuse extremely low amplitude beta and alpha activity.  There is a symmetric very low voltage 8-8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.    Drowsiness is characterized by attentuation of the alpha rhythm, prominent anterior beta activity, central theta activity, roving eye movements, positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS) and vertex waves. Stage 2 sleep is characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and K-complexes.   Other findings: The single lead ECG shows a regular and sinus rhythm.   Events:  Event 1 - nonepileptic 10:07 - patient was receiving routine nursing care.  He is looking for the event button.  Then he asked the nurse if she could push the event button because he feels that he is about to have a seizure.  (he has a child-like prosody.)  He leans back on his left side, becomes very stiff, hands go into a ""claw-like"" position and rigid with rapid low amplitude shaking of his arms.  There is shaking in his legs but to a lesser extent.  He unable to speak.  He is in a stiff rigid posture with hands shaking for about 30 seconds, he relaxes and stiffens and relaxes for a couple of cycles.  Then he is unresponsive until 10:08:25. There is tremor artifact on the EEG but no evolving ictal activity or epileptiform discharges.   Interpretation:  This is a normal more than 15 hours continuous video EEG recording. The episode of arms and hands clenching and extremity rigidity and shaking is a psychogenic nonepileptic event.

Used ice for the first 24 hours and then switched to heat per advice of patient advisory nurse I called on Thursday night.  By Monday, I still was not better.

I use a heating pad throughout the day and especially at night to go to sleep.  Thursday will be 30 days since I received the shot.

I had someone who looked up ""canned information"" that had been provided and said I could have pain up to 30 days as has been reported.  This is not normal pain.  When your lymph nodes were as hard as rocks on the left side and pain is shooting down into your hand for the first two weeks, that is not normal.  This is also just occurring on my left arm.

She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.

1104214,03/16/2021,MA,31.0,31,,F,,"I was 9 weeks and 2 days pregnant with my first pregnancy (no history of miscarriages) when I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/9/2021. I had a routine appointment with my OB-GYN the day prior, 1/8/2021, during which they completed a routine ultrasound. At that time, the ultra sound was completely normal with a healthy fetus and heart rate, and my due date was estimated to be 8/13/2021. Also at that time, I was advised by my OB-GYN to get the COVID vaccine, when offered to me, given my higher risk of contracting COVID due to my job as a healthcare worker with direct patient contact, and my higher risk for more severe illness if I contracted COVID due to pregnancy. I received the vaccine the next day with no immediate adverse reactions/events aside from some considerable arm soreness at the site of the vaccine and fatigue. Then 2 weeks and 6 days later I had another routine appointment with my OB-GYN (1/29/2021) at which point in time I was 12 weeks and 1 day pregnant. During this visit they conducted a second routine ultrasound. From this ultra sound they identified multiple abnormalities including an increased nuchal translucency of 3.5 mm, absent nasal bone, and presence of fluid around the fetus?s abdomen. These abnormalities were concerning for a chromosomal/genetic abnormality. Given these concerns I had labs drawn for maternal carrier screening (the Panorama and the Horizon 274), and I was referred to maternal fetal medicine for further imaging and testing. The results of the lab work took approximately 2 weeks to receive, but they came back normal without increased risk identified for any of the chromosomal/genetic conditions tested. I was seen by a high risk doctor and a genetic counselor within the maternal fetal medicine department on 2/2/2021. At this appointment I had a third ultrasound completed which confirmed the presence of an increased nuchal translucency now 4.3mm, and also found the presence of a cystic hygroma. These findings were again consistent with concerns for a chromosomal, genetic or other anatomical/structural condition and as such I had a chorionic villus sampling done that same day to assess the DNA of the fetus. These results also came back all normal without concern for any of the chromosomal or genetic conditions tested. I then had a follow up appointment and ultrasound with the maternal fetal medicine department on 2/19/2021, at which point I was 15 weeks and 1 day pregnant. This early anatomical scan revealed even more concerning findings with the fetus?s humerus measuring in the 1st percentile for gestational age and the fetus?s femur measuring in the 3rd percentile for gestational age. Per consultation with our genetic counselor this was indicative or some severe condition; however, it was not clear exactly what condition. Given the severity of the findings it was recommended to terminate the pregnancy. As such I had to undergo a dilation and evacuation procedure on 2/24/2021. We are currently still awaiting results of further genetic testing (exome testing), the results of which can take 2-3 months from the time of sending out the labs (sent out around 2/24/2021).",,,,,,,,,Y,01/09/2021,01/29/2021,20,"Ultrasound 1/29/2021: increased nuchal translucency of 3.55mm, absent nasal bone, fluid around fetus?s abdomen.

Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.

I went to bed and by morning I felt so sick I could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I slept for most of 14 hours, plus off and on all the next day. then all the next night. I tried not to take any over the counter medication because I had heard or read conflicting information as to the effect of these medications on the vaccine. However by 11:00 AM (just over 20 hours after vaccination) I couldn't stand it any more. I took 1 Tylenol. I began to feel slightly better such that I was able to get to the bathroom and get something to drink. However, I knew exactly when the Tylenol wore off 4 hours later. I took another Tylenol with a similar result. After sleeping all night, I didn't feel much better by the next morning. At 8:00 AM (just over 41 hours after vaccination) I took 1 ibuprofen. Within an hour, I started to sweat. Within an hour after that I started to improve. Buy the end of that day, I was feeling much better, however still fatigued. The fatigue lasted most of the next week. Please note, I returned to work (online teaching from home) the next day. This didn't help the fatigue situation.  Other symptoms I noticed included a second round of Covid Arm. The 2nd vaccine was injected into the opposite arm because I experienced Covid Arm in my left arm after my first injection - see Vaers Report Temporary Number dated 2/14/21. I received  my 2nd injection in the opposite arm. This time, the rash appeared much sooner - 3 days after injection, and went away much more quickly (2 days later). This rash was not as itchy, but was also not identical to the first rash. The first time the rash was blotchy and bumpy. The second time it was more of a slightly raised red square blotch. Pictures are available if needed.  Another significant symptom was an increase in congestion and nasal drainage prominent the night after the injection and lasting through the time I began to feel better.

I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks.

She felt fine right after her vaccination but as she drove to her destination where she was going to take a walk, she started to develop left-sided facial burning and swelling.  That prompted her to call her PCP in that office recommended she come back to the vaccination clinic to be evaluated.   I evaluated her at approximately 2 PM.. She was feeling well for the most part with the exception of left-sided facial burning and swelling and a little bit of redness over her left cheek.  She denied fevers, chills, itching, other areas of rash, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, tongue swelling, lip swelling, wheezing, chest pain, or difficulty breathing.   She recalls a penicillin allergy at age 5 or 6 but cannot remember the reaction. She has never reacted to a vaccine before.   Initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 134/73, a pulse that was 70 and regular, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She had normal mental status and her lungs were clear. The left side of her face was slightly swollen over her left cheek as compared to the right with some slight increased flushing on the left side. There was no stridor, she was speaking comfortably, and her lungs were clear with good airflow. Her heart demonstrated S1 and S2 with regular rate and rhythm.   I administered 2 doses of Benadryl, 25 mg with each dose about 15 minutes apart with her last dose at approximately 2:25 PM.   I rechecked her vital signs at 2:50 PM and her blood pressure was 138/79 with a pulse of 70 and regular and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her lungs were clear and she was moving good air. I did take a relook at her face which was improved with decreased swelling.   At 3 PM, because she was doing much better, I discharged her to home with instructions to use Benadryl 50 mg when she got home and then 25 to 50 mg every 4 hours today. If she develops any respiratory symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, cough, breathing difficulty, swollen tongue or swollen lips, as well as increased facial swelling, she will call 911 to be evaluated.

This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.

I had difficulty sleeping and vivid dreams.  I have had thyroiditis twice in my life after giving birth to my 2 children with similar dizziness and throat fullness.  I decided to contact my doctors and had my thyroid levels checked.  My TSH was abnormal and my doctor thinks I could be having another episode of thyroiditis.  My menstrual cycle arrived a week early.  Following this, I continued to have dizziness, throat fullness, and intense headaches.  I developed sore breasts and breast discharge as well as in increase in frequency of urination.  I decided to postpone the second shot until I was feeling better as past episodes of thryoiditis took about 2 months to resolve.  My next menstrual period was a week late, also accompanied by mood swings, breast tenderness and intense headaches.  SIx weeks later, I continue to experience occasional dizziness and throat fullness and increased urination.  Prior to the vaccine, I was feeling fine and it seems like the vaccine triggered some kind of hormone/endocrine response in my body.  I have not had reactions to any vaccines prior to this.

Two days after that (about the 7th or so), I noticed that I had a rash on my right arm - elbow height (not injection site) - upper forearm. Not the bulls eye rash but just a rash and it itched super bad. I called the on-staff doctor because it was after hours. He said I could use cortisone cream on it to help with the itching. I also took some ibuprofen because I had the fever. The cream helped get rid of the rash within a couple of days. I still had the overall skin itchiness on my legs and stuff that I still had from the first vaccine - that overall itchiness had never gone away and I still had it. February 25, I woke up and I had some mild hives on my face and my eyelids were puffy and swollen and itchy (face was kind of itchy). I kept using the anti-itch lotion (from the first dose) and I quit taking my supplements to see if that would help. By the 26th, it was pretty bad. She prescribed me some steriods - methylprednisolone. She said if the hives left don't start it yet because she didn't want me to start it that night. So next morning, it wasn't horrible, so I didn't start taking them until March 1st and they are six day ones. It got pretty red and hived out and rashy  for a few days and the steriods seems to clear that by the six days. So by the 7th it was almost gone and by the 8th was all gone.

(I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn't have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/12/2021,03/12/2021,0,N/A,SCH,,NA,NA,NA,,,2,03/16/2021,,,,NA

I did not get sick the next day, I just had the regular big red sore bump at the injection site. However, slightly more than a week after my 2nd dose, I started to experience double vision. Not blurry vision, but double vision, with one image on top of the other, both clear. At first it didn't bother me much, it was mostly happening in the mornings and in the evenings. Then suddenly, between the dates of 2/25 and 3/1, I started experiencing the double vision much more intensely and earlier in the day. It was not safe for me to drive, and it bothered me a lot, causing headaches and extreme nausea, I found myself going to bed at 6pm because I didn't want to be awake and deal with the side effects. I saw an Ophthalmologist (Dr.)  about the problem (not realizing it was a COVID-19 vaccine side effect) who diagnosed me with cranial nerve 4 palsy in the left eye.  I had to notify my job that I was unable to drive and that effected my work.

See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.",,,Y,,Y,4,,,N,03/05/2021,03/06/2021,1,"EKG, Chest X-ray, CT Scan, ECG, Cardiac Catherization, CBC, Troponin significantly elevated",OTH,,"atorvastatin 20 mg, Vitamin D 1000 IU",None,"Mixed hyperlipidemia, Palpitations",,,2,03/16/2021,,,Y,"Sulfa, Cipro"

Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept 'blowing up' my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn't take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.

My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine.

COMPARISON:          None.          TECHNIQUE:          Serial sagittal, axial, and coronal images were obtained in various T1      and T2 weighted sequences through the level of the brain without iv      contrast.  Diffusion weighted imaging was included.          FINDINGS:          No restricted diffusion is seen to suggest an acute infarct.      Ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are normal for patient's age.      Normal-appearing flow-voids are seen for the major intracranial vessels.      There is moderate supratentorial white matter disease suggestive of      chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  There is a normal appearance of      the 7th and 8th cranial nerve complexes.  There is no cerebellar      tonsillar ectopia.  Midline structures are normal.  There is mild fluid      in the bilateral mastoid air cells.  Paranasal sinuses are clear.

INDICATION: Left lower quadrant pain.   COMPARISON: CT chest with contrast 5/15/2020.   FINDINGS: Centrilobular emphysematous changes in the included lower lungs. Resolution of  previously seen groundglass opacity in the posterior right lower lobe since 5/15/2020. No  pleural or pericardial effusions. Heart size is normal.   Innumerable hepatic cysts throughout the liver, the largest in the medial segment of left lobe  measuring up to 3.9 cm. Fatty replacement of the pancreas. Gallbladder is partially contracted  but otherwise unremarkable head CT. Small accessory splenule near the pancreatic tail with  spleen otherwise unremarkable. Bilateral adrenals are normal. Small bilateral renal cysts.  Hypertrophy of the median lobe of the prostate with dystrophic calcifications in the prostate  with extrinsic mass effect on the posterior bladder base. Concentric thickening of the bladder  wall, likely related to bladder outlet obstruction, but evaluation is limited as the bladder is   incompletely distended.   Acute diverticulitis of the proximal sigmoid colon with diverticula, wall thickening and mild  adjacent mesenteric soft tissue stranding. Scattered colonic diverticulosis elsewhere in the  colon with no other areas of diverticulitis. Tiny hiatal hernia. No other areas of significant  bowel wall thickening and no bowel obstruction. The appendix is not visualized . Tiny miniscule   fat-containing ventral periumbilical and bilateral inguinal hernias, also doubtful clinical  significance. No ascites or adenopathy. Atherosclerotic calcifications in the abdominal aorta  and its distal branches without aneurysm. Grade 1 degenerative anterolisthesis L4 on L5 and  retrolisthesis L2 on L3 and slightly of L1 on L2 and L3 on L4. Mild chronic compression  deformity of anterior L1 vertebral body. No acute osseous abnormality.   IMPRESSION:  1. Sigmoid diverticulitis.  2. Resolution of previously seen groundglass opacity in the right lower lobe since CT chest of  5/15/2020.  3. Concentric thickening of the bladder wall, suboptimally evaluated but likely due to bladder  outlet obstruction from median lobe hypertrophy of the prostate. Suggest correlate with PSA  levels if not recently done.  4. Mild chronic compression deformity of anterior vertebral body and chronic spondylosis in the   included spine.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I'm wondering if I don't need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I'm due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I'm trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it's been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25.

Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.

TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging and 2-D reformatting performed from the level of the lung bases  through the pelvis without IV and  without oral contrast.  This exam was performed according to   our departmental dose-optimization program, which includes automated exposure control,  adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction   technique.   FINDINGS:  Linear atelectasis is seen at the right lung base. There is trace right pleural effusion. The  left lung base is clear. Degenerative changes are seen in the lower lumbar spine.   Hyperintense elliptical nodular areas are seen along the liver with indentation of the  underlying liver surface. The largest area measures 4 x 1.3 cm in the axial dimension, image 32   of series 2, and 4.5 cm in the craniocaudal dimension.   A 7 mm hypodense lesion is seen in the left hepatic lobe on image 16 is indeterminant and could   represent a cyst. Remainder of the liver parenchyma appears unremarkable. Trace fluid is seen  adjacent to the tip of the liver.   The biliary tree, gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The abdominal aorta   is normal in caliber. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.   The patient is status post hysterectomy. Suture material is seen in the right lower quadrant in   the small and large bowels compatible with prior bowel surgery. Scattered surgical clips are  seen in the mid abdomen. There is subcutaneous fluid collection in the midline anterior pelvic  wall with fluid fluid level measuring 9.3 x 3.8 cm in the cross-section and 7.8 cm in the  craniocaudal dimension. It could represent a focal postoperative fluid collection. A smaller  right lower quadrant abdominal wall fluid collection is seen measuring 3.5 x 1.9 cm in the  axial dimension and 5.4 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. A third even smaller abdominal fluid  collection is seen in the left lower quadrant on image 56.   Slightly hyperdense nodules are seen scattered in the upper abdomen at the porta hepatis (image   30), pancreatic head region ( image 37), left abdomen mesentery (image 44), left upper  quadrant (images 39-44). Evaluation is limited due to lack of intravenous and oral contrast.   Large fecal retention is seen throughout the colon. At the rectosigmoid junction, there is  focal narrowing with soft tissue prominence and associated calcifications measuring  approximately 2.1 x 1.9 cm, image 85 of series 2, and 1.8 cm in length, image 105 of series  801. This could be due to underlying lesion or postoperative changes.   There is bilateral severe hydronephrosis. There is severe hydroureter of the visualized  proximal and mid ureters. The course of the ureter is difficult to follow in the pelvic region.   The urinary bladder appears unremarkable.   The small bowel is normal in caliber without dilatation. There is no abdominal or pelvic  ascites. No bulky pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen.   IMPRESSION:  1. Evidence of prior bowel surgery and hysterectomy. Subcutaneous pelvic wall fluid collections   in the midline and bilaterally with fluid fluid level suggesting recent surgery and  postoperative seromas. Correlation with clinical history is recommended.  2. Multiple findings including nodular densities along the liver surface, multiple hyperdense  mesenteric nodules in the upper abdomen, hyperdense nodule in the region of the pancreatic head   raising possibility of metastatic disease. Correlation with history of primary neoplasm is  recommended.  3. Focal narrowing at the junction of the rectosigmoid colon with solid tissue and  calcifications could be due to prior surgery or additional metastatic disease.  4. Severe bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter could be due to distal fibrosis. Distal  ureters in the pelvis are not visualized.  5. Trace right pleural effusion. Trace ascites at the tip of the liver.  6. 7 mm hypodense hepatic lesion is indeterminate.

Mild degenerative changes are  seen in the sacroiliac joints bilaterally.   Evaluation of individual axial levels demonstrates the following:   T12/L1: Unremarkable.   L1/2: Mild bilateral facet arthropathy is seen. There is mild diffuse disc bulge. No focal disc   herniation, central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is seen.   L2/3: Mild bilateral facet arthropathy is seen. There is mild diffuse disc bulge. No focal disc   herniation, central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is seen.   L3/4: There is decreased disc height. Severe bilateral facet arthropathy is present causing  grade 1 anterolisthesis measuring approximately 4 mm. There is moderate central canal stenosis  and mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.   L4/5: There is diffuse disc bulge. Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy is seen. There is mild  central canal stenosis. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is seen, more prominent on  the left.   L5/S1: Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy is present. There is decreased disc height. Diffuse   disc osteophyte complex is seen. There is 2 mm retrolisthesis of L5 on S1. There is no central   canal stenosis. Severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is seen, more prominent on the  right.   IMPRESSION:  No focal disc herniation or acute fracture. Chronic degenerative changes, more prominent in the   lower lumbar spine as detailed above.

This exam was performed according to  our departmental dose-optimization program, which includes automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction  technique. FINDINGS: Degenerative changes are seen in the visualized spine. The visualized osseous structures are osteopenic. The patient is status post left total hip arthroplasty. Mild atelectasis is seen at  the lung bases. There is a large hiatal hernia which is not fully visualized at its proximal aspect. The distal  esophagus appears fluid-filled. The GE junction is not well visualized. On the prior examination, the GE junction appears to be in normal location. This is suggestive of a paraesophageal hiatal hernia. There is significant distention of the herniated portion of the hernia in the lower thorax and a portion in the left upper quadrant. The gastric outlet tract is not fully delineated but could be located in the hiatus. The duodenum is normal in caliber. The small bowel is not dilated. Large amount of fecal matter  is seen throughout the colon with the largest amount in the rectum. There is no abdominal or pelvic ascites. The noncontrast appearance of the liver, biliary tree, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Nonobstructive bilateral renal calculi are seen. Right renal cysts are also visualized. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. The fetus vascular calcifications are seen along the abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The urinary bladder, uterus and adnexa appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Large hiatal hernia whose superior aspect is not visualized. Significantly distended herniated portion of the stomach and the portion in the left upper quadrant compatible with gastric outlet obstruction.

She immediately became unresponsive and her eyes rolled back into her head but she came to. She was responding somewhat to questions but she was also slightly mentally impaired at baseline due to her co-morbidities.

All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure +/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient's response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.

Culture   Pending            Report Status   Pending              Medical Decision Making:  Patient is an 89-year-old male who presents emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath and cough.  Differential diagnosis includes, but is not limited to, acute coronary syndrome, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, reaction from recent COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 infection, other viral upper respiratory infection, pleural effusion, or CHF. The patient denies any discrete chest pain at this time, though he has had some chest pain with exertion for the past 6 months.  He has had shortness of breath along with his cough, increasing my suspicion for possible infectious process.  Upon his arrival, the patient is known to be tachypneic, with normal oxygen saturation rates.  He is not tachycardic or febrile, therefore does not meet SIRS criteria at this time. Plan at this time to obtain laboratory evaluations, chest x-ray, and EKG.  Low threshold to broaden evaluations to include infectious workup.     Please reference the remaining ED Course for further assessment, plan, and disposition documentation.              ED Course as of Feb 14 1916    Sun Feb 14, 2021    1230   EKG reveals sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute.  QRS duration 100 milliseconds.  QTC slightly prolonged at 460 milliseconds.  There is somewhat concerning peaked T-waves in leads V2 and V3 along with with possible ST elevation in lead V1 this does represent a change from the patient's previous study in November, 2020.    EKG (Hospital)    1315   No leukocytosis.  Hemoglobin and hematocrit within normal limits for the patient.  No thrombocytopenia.  Slight elevation in absolute neutrophil count.   CBC (Complete Blood Count) With Differential(!)    1330   Elevated at 176. As the patient has been having pain for the past 2 days, I am uncertain if this is catching the increase in his troponin, or the downtrend.  He continues to deny chest pain and has reported that his shortness of breath has resolved.   TROPONIN T, HIGH SENSITIVITY(!!)     1419   Electrolytes within normal limits.  Creatinine elevated at 1.41, though this is not significantly elevated in comparison to study obtained approximately 3 weeks ago at 1.2.  Liver function tests within normal limits.  No anion gap.   Comprehensive Metabolic Panel(!)     1420   By my interpretation, multifocal bilateral infiltrates, most consistent with COVID-19.  Also possible right middle lobe infiltrate, concerning for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia.  This is interesting as the patient did just receive his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.     Plan at this time to broaden infectious work up and order for the patient to receive empiric antibiotics.   XR Chest 1V Portable    1437   Elevated at 2.5.

Significant and concerning patchy airspace opacities of the right upper, right lower and left mid lung, concerning for a pneumonic process. Less likely, viral upper is for infection, including Covid 19, could be present.     2.

She agrees that he is likely DNR DNI, but does think that he would like to have the cardiac catheterization completed.  I will confirm this with the patient.      1617   Patient noted to become hypoxic to 76%. Borderline hypotensive at 91/55. No associated tachycardia. Slightly tachypneic at 26 br/min. Oxygen increased to 15 L/min and RT paged for BiPAP.     After a discussion with the patient, he endorses that he understands what DNR/DNI status means, as his wife recently passed away approximately five months ago. He does share that he wishes to be DNR/DNI, which he believes he has paperwork reflecting. I believe at this time that he is of sound mind to make this decision as well, should we not have paperwork available to us reinforce this. He does request that I contact his daughter.      1621   Bedside cardiac ultrasound does not reveal pericardial effusion.  IVC appears flat.  Will order for the patient receive a 2nd 500 cubic centimeters bolus.  RT is present at the bedside Redding to place NIPPV.      1704   D-dimer does age adjust within normal limit.   D-DIMER(!)     1705   Patient with acute primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic acidosis. Continues to be hypoxic on 100% FiO2 with saturation rates at 89%.      At this point in time, I favor the patient's NSTEMI is secondary to demand ischemia given his ongoing hypoxia.  However, given his previous reported history of exertional chest discomfort and dyspnea on exertion, I will at least discuss the patient with another Hospital.   ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS(!)     1805   Patient did have a significant desaturation event that resulted after he disconnected himself from NIPPV.  Upon my arrival into the room, he was noted to be setting 8% with good waveform.  He was cyanotic with agonal respirations.  He was noted to have a pulse that corresponded with the monitor at a tachycardic rate.  He was rapidly placed in a supine position and of bagged with a non-rebreather to increase his oxygen saturation rates.  His oxygen saturation rate did increase, but has not completely recovered.  We did bag him for several minutes and his oxygen level is now in the low 80s.  He is currently on non-rebreather at 15 liters/minute.  He is not following commands.  His daughter is present and I did advise her of this recent update.  I did speak to another Hospital and inform them that the patient would not be transferred at this time.  Patient's blood pressure is noted to be 124/73 mmHg, therefore I will order him some morphine for air hunger.  I did brief the patient's daughter on his current status and we will have her be present in the room with him.      1851   Patient continued to deteriorate, ultimately coughing up bloody secretions. He was suctioned, but continued to be tachypneic and have increased work of breathing. He became bradycardic with heart rates in the 30s. After a discussion with the patient's daughter, the decision was made to silence alarms. Patient was accompanied by his daughter, ultimately noted to lose pulses and time of death was called at 1830, confirmed by loss of palpable pulses and lose of auscultated pulses.      Time was spent discussing the patient with his daughter. We did expedite his PCR COVID swab so as to ultimately know his COVID-19 status. We did offer to contact additionally family members on the behalf of the patient's family.",PVT,,"Rivaroxaban 15 and 20 MG,   Tylenol, Meclizine 25 MG; Aspirin 18 MG daily, Pravastatin 20 MG daily, Multivitamins, BP formulation, Norvasc 5mg tablet daily . atenolol 25MG tablet daily",none,"Abdominal Aortic Anuerysm, Atypical chest pain, Benign essential Hypertension, Pure hypercholesterolemia",,,2,03/16/2021,,,Y,none

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 01Mar2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a literature report.  A 22-year-old healthy male with no medication use received the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT16B2b2 mRNA vaccine through his work as an emergency department employee. On day three, post-vaccination, he experienced widespread petechiae and gum bleeding, which prompted his presentation. He was current on his vaccines, including yearly influenza, with no history of adverse reactions. He denied respiratory and gastrointestinal complaints or a history of infection. He had no personal or family history of bleeding or autoimmune dis-ease. Vital signs and the remainder of his exam were normal. Laboratory tests revealed normal white-cell count, hemoglobin, and severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 2 x 109/L. Two months prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient was evaluated at an outpatient clinic for upper respiratory symptoms. His PCR assay returned negative for SARS-CoV-2, and complete blood count was unremarkable with a normal platelet count of 145 x 109/L (reference range, 140-400 x 109/L). The upper respiratory symptoms resolved within a few days, and the patient had no further complaints. However, as a precautionary measure, one-week post outpatient evaluation, he was again tested for SARS-CoV-2, which returned negative. At the emergency department on day 3, post-vaccination, the following labs were normal or negative: prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, blood urea nitrogen, creatine, electrolytes, bilirubin, Lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, globulin, total protein, and haptoglobin. The aspartate aminotransferase (42) and alanine aminotransferase (90) were mildly elevated; however, they normalized the next day. Additionally, he tested negative for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C anti-body, and Epstein-Barr Virus serology. A nasopharyngeal swab also returned negative for SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The patient was then admitted and given dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days, a platelet transfusion, and intravenous immunoglobulin at 1 g/kg for 2 days. Immunologic studies performed on day 6 for Rheumatoid factor, antibodies for Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide, Anti Centromere, Chroma-tin IgG, dsDNA, Jo1, Ribosomal P Protein, Ribonucleoprotein, Scleroderma, Smith, Sjogren's Syndrome B, Sm/Rnp IgG, AntinuclearAntibody (<1:80, normal <1:80) were normal. However, Sjogren's Syndrome A antibody (2.8) was elevated (normal <1 AI). On day six, post-vaccination, petechiae and oral bleeding decreased, and the patient was discharged with a platelet count of 28 x 109/L. Based on the presentation, a platelet count <100 x 109/L, and the exclusion of alternative causes, a diagnosis of ITP wasmade. At follow up, on day 11, the patient's platelet count normalized to173 x 109/L, and the patient tested positive for plasma IIb/IIIa and Ia/IIa platelet autoantibodies. Sjogren's Syndrome A antibody decreased from 2.8 on day 6 to 1.5 (normal <1 AI). Moreover, complement C3 (94) was normal (reference range, 79-152 mg/dL), while complement C4(10.9 mg/dL) was low (reference range, 16-38 mg/dL). On day 34 a repeat of the patient's abnormal immunologic studies showed a normal value of both Sjogren's syndrome A antibody (SSAAB: <0.2) and Complement C4 (27.6 mg/dL). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing was performed to rule out that a previous COVID-19 infection elicited the ITP experienced on day 3. However, SARS- CoV-2 IgG was negative. As of 16Feb2021, and since the patient's discharge on day6, he remains healthy without any evidence or symptoms of autoimmune disease. This is the first case published in the medical literature of an individual, with no other cause identified and no associated illness, experiencing ITP after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The temporal relationship of the patient's presentation 3 days post-vaccine administration suggests, but does not prove, the vaccine may be linked to the patient's ITP. Additionally, the rapid and severe drop in platelet count to 2 x 109/L is reminiscent of the abrupt onset observed in drug-induced thrombocytopenia, which further suggests a recent etiology. However, it must be noted that the incidence of ITP is about 3.3 per 100 000 adults/year. Therefore, it is also plausible that this patient's diagnosis was purely coincidental, given that the country has administered over 12 million vaccines to date. Addition-ally, 43 448 participants were included in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial, and no ITP was reported. Moreover, considering the low complement C4 (10.9 mg/dL), mildly elevated SSA Ab (1.5), and 2 months prior, the platelet count (145 x 109/L) was near the lower limit, it is difficult to exclude alternative causes, such as an underlying autoimmune condition with pre-existing ITP. In this scenario, the ITP became clinically apparent following the vaccine, though this patient never manifested symptoms suggestive of autoimmune disease. This case was reported to the FDA's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and is valuable both for post-approval pharmacovigilance and as a foundation for clinicians to evaluate future patients with suspected ITP. Rare vaccination events are important, but do not diminish the enormous utility of vaccination and the well-documented safety profile 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT16B2b2 mRNA vaccine.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender's Comments: The young adult having extremely low platelet 3 days presented with skin/subcutaneous bleeding following vaccination, a contributory role of the vaccine use therefore cannot be fully excluded in triggering the event onset.

Joint aches, fatigue but couldn't sleep due to the pain, loss of taste and smell, nausea, felt real cold, shakes, congestion, gassy, hurt to breath, headache, shallow breathing, slightly elevated heart rate.

Second day was miserable; I still had a fever that gradually went down. Finally was able to sleep end of second day. I continued to drink a lot of water and hot Green Tea. Third day, still fatigued, mild heachach. Mild sore arm for three days.  Third through  nine days I have a below normal temperature, hoarseness, mild headache, and fatigue.  the medical center gave me annual flu vaccinations. I've never had a side effect from them. While I was in the medical center, before I was deployed overseas, the medical center gave me some dozen vaccinations. Again, no side effects from them.  I have never been around anyone who turned out later to have Covid 19 or tested positive for it.  I have never had the flu. I have had some four cases of a cold. Worst illness was after my exposure to norovirus. I was gravely ill, had to be admitted to the hospital here. Norovirus worse than the two cases of food poisoning I had.  I figure with those awful side effects I now have an immune system better able to handle Covid 19 if I do get exposed.

She was told to breath deeply and she quickly started feeling ""a little better"" so she was helped to a chair with arm rests in the room.  She said she had an orange in her bag, so she started eating her orange.  Just a minute later she said she was going to pass out, so the pharmacist caught her.  He held her up in the chair and tried to revive her for a few moments but noticed that the blood was draining from her face and her lips were turning blue so yelled for one of his technicians to call 911 and the other to grab an epi pen.  He then lowered her to the floor in case he needed to begin to resuscitate while the technician brought him the epipen.  While lowering her she urinated on herself.  As the pharmacist went to check her vitals before administering the epipen and beginning cpr if necessary the patient suddenly gasped once and her eyes opened widely, but not continue to breath.  Upon inspection in her mouth there was a piece of orange near the bottom of the throat.  The pharmacist asked if she was choking and she did not response at all, but did not start visibly breathing either.  So the pharmacist swiped the piece of orange out quickly, in case it was either previously lodged or patient would have to be resuscitated.  She did not seem to enjoy this and this seemed to wake her up and she quietly gasped not choking.  She started to quickly improve and admitted that she was feeling better, and had passed out before after getting blood drawn but never after a shot so didn't mention this.  While this was happening a police office was going through the drive through so the technician called him in for assistance and he arrived around this time.  He asked her a few questions like ""what's her name, who's president, how many quarters are in a dollar"" which she was able to answer.  She said she was mostly embarrassed and was feeling much better.  She sat up in the chair again about the time the emts came in.  The checked her out, but she didn't want to go to the Emergency Room.  She was driven home by her father.

She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can't get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine.

After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn't allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can't afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I'm still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness.

A rapid investigation was completed, and it was determined that the first patient who visited that booth today had received a dose from a vial that was potentially left-over from the clinic last night. An immediate conference with site leadership was conducted. The patient was identified via computer database by encounter time stamp and confirmed by the vaccinator team. Extensive research and consultation were conducted by Dr., including contacting Pfizer for consultation, and reviewing information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) including Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations.  Per the Pfizer document entitled Storage and Handling of DILUTED VIALS Outside of Recommendations in the EUA Prescribing Information DURING and AFTER DILUTION?: Pfizer has conducted physical and chemical stability studies which have shown that the vaccine maintains all its measured quality attributes when diluted vaccine is stored in the vial at 2ï¿½C to 30ï¿½C for up to a cumulative period of 18 hours, in addition to the routine/labelled in-use period [of 6 hours]. It was determined that immediate administration of another dose was not required based on this information. In addition, clinical studies had not been performed that examined reissuing an initial vaccine after receiving one handled outside of the Emergency Use Authorization recommendations. The patient is scheduled to return in three weeks for their second dose. The patient was contacted and advised of the situation, and questions and concerns addressed. Immediate changes were implemented to avoid exhausted vials from being near the pharmacy.   Background:  Vaccinators in the clinic are from multiple agencies and are providing support to Community Vaccination Center Programs. Vaccine is reconstituted in the pharmacy. This is a controlled booth. Vaccinators enter the pharmacy booth at a defined entrance location where they receive a pre-filled plastic bin containing syringes, needles, vaccine record cards, and vaccine. The vaccine they receive is a multi-dose vial containing six doses, which are drawn-up individually in front of the patient in the vaccination booths due to community trust issues previously identified. When the supplies/vaccine is exhausted, the vaccinator returns to the pharmacy booth with their bin containing just the empty vial. This vial is stored in a plastic bag on the pharmacy table based off of inherited practices. The bin is replenished, and the vaccinator returns to their respective vaccination booth.   Incident:  Around 08:45hrs on 15 March 2021 vaccinators in Booth 1 reported to the joint on-site Pharmacy and indicated that upon draw-up for their second patient there was no vaccine in the multi-dose vial.  Investigation:  Dr. immediately convened a conference with the pharmacists present in the pharmacy booth. They included a Pharmacist, and Commanders.  It was determined that the vial likely originated from the bag of empty vials contained in a bag which had overflowed onto the pharmacy table. The vial in question likely contained an extra dose that was not administered last night due to appointment no-shows. This yielded the concern that the dose that was administered had become inactivated due to time after reconstitution and temperature. The vaccine was reconstituted at approximately 19:00hrs last evening (14 Mar 2021) and was no longer temperature controlled after that time.  Dr. contacted the manufacturer, Pfizer, who identified that their research indicates the vaccine to be chemically intact over 18 hours after reconstitution if stored in the vial between 2-30 degrees Celsius; this being the case for this vial. Dr. conferenced with the pharmacists, compared information with the CDC guidelines, and developed consensus that readministering the first dose was not required given that all quality attributes were likely maintained per the Pfizer stability studies. Dr. then notified the patient of the conclusion and provided instruction to return at their scheduled appointment date in three weeks for their second dose. Patient reported no symptoms at the time.     Immediate Actions Taken:  Department of Health utilized their Database to determine the patient who received the inactivated dose.   Dr. contacted the vaccine manufacturer Pfizer   Dr. then contacted the patient,   Controls were altered to remove the exhausted vials from the pharmacy table.   Vaccinators were instructed to verify their vials for appropriate volume/dosages.  Notifications made to site.  Patient advised to return to clinic at scheduled appointment time in three weeks to receive second dose.  Conclusion: The new safety controls in place in the pharmacy will prevent future similar occurrences. This information will be pushed to all clinic personnel in the form of a safety briefing to acknowledge the misstep and create awareness to decrease chances of future events. The patient was not harmed in this event and has received guidance from Dr. after review of manufacturer and CDC information.",,,,,,,,,,03/15/2021,03/15/2021,0,,PUB,,,,,,NYSDOHCDMSRegistrationID7,2,03/17/2021,,,,
