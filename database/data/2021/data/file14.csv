My oxygen saturation was 93 and they wanted to admit me but I am a single mom with a new diabetic 14-year-old at home so they let me go home with a pulse oximeter and a prescription for doxycycline For 10 days.  They called me the next day from the emergency room to follow up with a pulmonologist and cardiologist. On January 28 I saw the pulmonologist who did an ultrasound in his office and saw the fluid on my left lung. He said that most likely because the technique of the injection was so high in my shoulder that they probably had a nerve and I did have the swelling in the lymphadenopathy and all the pain and it hurt when I breathe so I wasn?t breathing correctly and I was splitting my arm against me and that?s how I probably developed plural effusion and pneumonia.

By 3:45am I was able to sleep until 7am. 7am on Thursday morning my temperature was normal (98.6) but my head was hurting. I had some weakness but was able to stand long enough to shower. The biggest symptom I had all day Thursday was a lot of body aches. Mostly in my hips and back, but all over. My right arm was also extremely red and swollen. Wednesday and Thursday I stayed home from work. Friday I returned to work, but I had a headache, would get over heated easily and had body aches. This is when the injection site and surrounding area began itching. Saturday I had a stomach ache and head ache and continued to feel sluggish. I did not move around much and was exacerbated trying to grocery shop. Sunday I had pressure in my head (top of the head) especially when I would bend down.  It is now Monday. My headache has cleared but my arm remains itchy, though there is no sign of swelling or redness.

It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours.

Historical vaccine included flu shot (Most of the time with the flu shot she has muscle pain) for immunization and had muscle pain. Concomitant medications were not reported. She got the Prevnar 13 shot two years ago and had a bad reaction. It was a week later she had a reaction. She experienced a swollen shoulder to her elbow on an unspecified date in 2018. She went to the doctor for the check up and was provided with two antibiotics. The doctor said that it could be an infection, but not at the injection site. She went to her doctor recently to see if she can take the COVID vaccine. She was asking if it was safe and if she was able to take the COVID vaccine. She was 65 years of age. She was a pharmacist. Caller states in Oct2018 she received Prevnar 13 shot and it was made by Pfizer. She had the shot on Monday. Most of the time with the flu shot she has muscle pain. When she got the Prevnar shot on Monday, on Tuesday she had a slight fever and it was a little red on an unspecified date in 2018. Like palm size redness on an unspecified date in 2018. She let it go because previously some other shots would have the same thing. On Friday, she had concern because her doctor wasn't going to be available, so he ordered a CBC and everything was ok. She went to the ER on Saturday because the swelling got bigger. The white count was elevated a little bit on an unspecified date in 2018. They said to wait and see. They drew the line and she went home. On Sunday, it was still there and the area was quite big. She went back to the ER. They gave her Septra DS, two BID (twice a day). She was still concerned and she called doctor. He added Keflex, 1 gram QID (four times a day). He advised her if it wasn't better to go see him on Wednesday. By Tuesday it had gone down. Her dad was sick and she rushed back to (address). With COVID she was concerned. Her doctor thinks she could have just been getting an infection and he doesn't think it is an allergy reaction. She was still concerned. Were there any documentation of issues with allergies to Prevnar 13 with COVID vaccine? Lot of people have skin reactions with Prevnar 13, she googled it and from chatting with friends and family. It depends on the degree. This kind of skin reaction was the first time for her on an unspecified date in 2018. Normally it would stay there for a couple of days. It just happened to be a Pfizer vaccine. She doesn't think there are any components that are similar to that. She wants to know if she can get the COVID vaccine. Are there any precautions she should watch for or wait? Apparently it was not an allergy to use Epipen or things like. Caller states her reaction to Prevnar 13 was two years and three months ago. She feels lots of people have skin reactions. She wants to be transferred to Medical Information. Caller declined to report. Should she wait for more safety report to come out? It was mRNA, lipid, and PEG. She doesn't have problems with Miralax. Caller was a pharmacist, retired 2 months ago, who asks should she get the vaccine? Caller reports that she was 67 yo who has a history of a skin reaction on her left arm after receiving the Prevnar 13 vaccine. She reports that this occurred 27 months ago. She reports that her doctor said it looked like an infection from the injection, she states that she ""was prescribed Septra DS 2 BID (twice a day) and it got better"".

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (""two"" Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for ""her rheumatoid""). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn't know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn't think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn't want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine.

Pain, blood cholesterol abnormal.  Pain in both of her arms, she said her left arm hurt more than her right arm from time to time, and when the left started hurting she took all the pills, but she didn't take Hydrocodone though it is prescribed, she didn't take that unless she was in a lot more pain than usual. She said her doctors said different things about her arm pain, one said she had a torn rotator cuff, another said arthritis, someone else said it was something in her neck but it was a big word that she didn't know, she just knew she had pain. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN, manufacturer: Bayer, UPC number: 349483 48150) from Aug2019 for TIA; carbamazepine from Jan2021 for pain in both of her arms; metoprolol succinate, had been taking it a couple years; zolpidem; hydrocodone for pain (she only takes if she is dying of pain, clarified to being in a lot of pain); atorvastatin for cholesterol.

She said 5 minutes into her drive she felt blood on her arm and put her hand in her shirt, and wiped it, saw blood. She said the bleeding was weird so she pulled over to look at her arm, and blood was coming from the top of the band aid where normally it would seep down from the bottom. She used five baby wipe, and wiped a lot of blood, until finally she thought it stopped bleeding. She was not light headed or in pain, it was a 45 minute drive and she got home and was still bleeding so she took her shirt off and put a towel around it to stop the bleeding and it finally stopped. She said she didn't think to report it until her doctor said to when she told him, he had said maybe the girl who gave her the shot hit a vein, but she should tell them. She said maybe she did hit a vein, because she had never had problems when getting a shot or more than a spot of blood in the past. She said one thing that may be important was that she had a couple of TIAs, many series (unable to clarify) her doctor friend assessed that with three MRIs and MRAs. She said she just refilled one of her medications, Clopidogrel, and was reading the instructions for it and it says it can cause excessive bleeding. She said that she was not bleeding so she didn't worry about it, that maybe that caused excessive bleeding.  She had not had a second dose, but she didn't want to go through this again with the bleeding, though if it was just a vein or air that may not happen. She said she was very healthy, no underlying conditions at all, never had a problem before, her arm was not painful, she was not light headed. She said the baby wipe she had on her arm after the car ride was full of blood, and she still couldn't get the band aid off, so she wrapped her arm towel kept sopping up blood until finally it quit. She put another band aid over the bloody band aid, and it quit and she was fine. She had no injection site pain, no tiredness, no headache.

Shortly after the shot in the medical observation area I experienced mild nausea that went away for the rest of the day.  About an hour after the injection, I experienced nasal drainage in the back of my throat that lasted about 30 minutes.  3 hours after my shot, the arm pain at injection site began, followed by 6 hours later moderate to extreme fatigue that did not cause me to be sleepy or drowsy--simply fatigued.  I had enhanced sense of taste and smell.  On Wednesday, 1/27 I woke up seeming okay and tried to work at my computer from home.  I experienced light-headed and dizziness, and a headache that feels like pressure, and sinus pressure at the bridge of my nose.  I had to disengage from work.  After lunch around 2 PM I had extreme fatigue and had to lie down in bed the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I have moderate nausea that comes in goes in waves.  This morning, Wednesday, 1/28 I woke up with nausea and ate breakfast with a heightened sense of smell and taste.  I logged into work and the lightheadedness and dizziness began again (also sort of in waves, though the headache is more pervasive and less wave-like than the nausea), along with waves of moderate nausea and headache.  The arm pain at the sight of injection has significantly abated from a punch to mild pain.  The ""sinus"" or sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose seems only a fraction improved.  The headache or pressure has moved from the back of my head to the right side of my head.  I had no body aches, but this morning has mild to moderate body aches this morning in my legs and hip bones.   1/29 I woke up with 20%-30% reduced symptoms of nausea and headache, but the dizziness and sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose remain the same.  I still have enhanced taste and smell (a sensory plus it's not a distorted or odd enhancement, simply the same flavors and tastes enhanced).  The ache that began yesterday in my lower body, my legs still ache, though it feels more like numbness than an ache.  I tried doing some stretches which felt good, but my legs still feel the same after stretching.  Pain at the site of injection is reduced 90%. There are some strawberries sitting next to me, and I can smell them acutely. Yesterday, 1/30, I woke up with mild nausea and fatigue.  This nausea dissipated in the morning, but I felt too fatigued to do Pilates.  The waves of dizziness and waves of nausea returned mid-day and I had a low-grade fever of 99.4 (my temp. Tends to run slightly lower than 98.6, as I take it regularly).  The pain/pressure in the bridge of my nose has reduced 30%, but still remains.  The ache or numbness in my thighs remains the same. This morning, 1/31, my temp is normal at 98.6, but I have mild waves of nausea and moderate waves of dizziness.  The pain/pressure on my nose remains the same as yesterday.  I have some mild ear pressure.  My thigh weakness remains the same.  I am too fatigued to attempt Pilates.  Acute sense of smell and taste remains the same.  The headaches or pressure also seem improved since Saturday 1/30. Monday, 02/01 - ah back to work I woke up with moderate nausea and pretty intense body fatigue and muscle aches in my lower body.  I had to work, and I just wanted to crawl back into bed.  I worked anyway, also the fatigue tends to worsen mid-day.  The dizziness is moderate in waves, and the headache is still mild, along with that mild sinus pressure on my nose.  I was in bed after dinner but could have rested all day.  02/02 I awoke with a very mild nausea! The intense fatigue (which worsened several days past my vaccine) was mild. I was ready to attempt my regular Pilates routine, and I did it!  My muscle aches are mild to moderate (also, why are my muscle aches mostly confined to my thighs and hips I do have vague pain at the injection site, but its vague, and I use my whole body in Pilates) dizziness waves are back as I sit here typing and get ready to login online to my job staring at the computer screen is jarring to the dizziness waves and reminds me of the mild headache.  This is the best I've felt since 1/27 through mid-day I tend to worsen and dizziness that is moderate is disturbing.  The heightened sense of taste and smell also seems to have waned a bit in the past two days, back to what I was per usual? I tend to have an acute sense of smell and taste.  *I would like it noted in light of new evidence that many people that have had COVID are experiencing intense reactions to the first dose that it is quite likely that I had COVID back in March when my learning center (I work with students age 4-adult, some of which are learning disabled and have autism) emergency closed because a client called to say she was positive for COVID.  I had taken her sons temperature the day before.  Me, and my two co-workers on my management team were also feeling sick.  I had a sore throat and chest pains for approx. a month, but at the time COVID testing was not widely available.  Since then, My co-worker has tested positive twice for the antibodies, and her husband, who was also sick at the same time, has tested negative twice.  I tested negative once for the antibodies, though given my job, my commute on the subway during rush hour my co-workers positivity, and my intense reaction to the first dose I most likely had COVID.  My boyfriend's roommate recently also revealed that he is positive to the antibodies, and he was literally sneezing and coughing in the same room with us this past summer and spring.    I think a 2nd dose of the same vaccine will cause fainting and vomiting, and the need for two weeks off of my work. This dizziness is alarming.  I'm also thinking not having antibodies means nothing in terms of my body and immune system recognizing the vaccine and the virus, making me more ill than when and if I actually had COVID in March or last year.",,,,,,,,,N,01/26/2021,01/27/2021,1,None,PUB,,None,None,Teenage Asthma I grew out of years ago.,,,2,02/02/2021,,Y,,"Penicillin, mango skin, dust mites"

At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain.

But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test.

She took Aleve and went back to bed. When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. I immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks.

I immediately noticed that the medication felt stuck in my esophagus and it was hard to swallow them down.  Being a nurse I began to monitor more closely my breathing.  I was able to take air into my lungs easily.  Next I noticed that my nose became very stuffy and was difficulty to breath through but my airway continued to seem ok and I was breathing without difficulty through my nose.  By about 210pm I had noticed that my face felt strange. As another few minutes progress my entire face felt numb like when your dental lidocaine is wearing off.  It was a very disturbing feeling.  I never had difficulty breathing but the throat and nasal swelling lasted about 1 1/2 hours.  The facial numbness lasted at least 4 hours and my nose and tongue still feel a little strange even at this moment.  I stayed in the observation area for about 35 minutes just to make sure I was not going to lose my airway before leaving.  I am a nurse and I didn't want to get sent to the ER for hours just to be given benadryl since my airway was ok so I didn't report it at the time of incident.  I had preloaded with zyrtec, pepcid and ibuprofen the morning prior to injection to try and avoid reaction or side effects that others were reporting.  I think if I had not had antihistamine in my system I would have had anaphylaxis for sure.  I went straight home and took more antihistamine.  Contacted my doctor so she knew of the symptoms.  She told me to continue the antihistamines for a few days and to go to the ER if severe issue happened.  This was a VERY VERY scary incident.   For a little history: after my first vaccine I noticed itching on my chest but couldn't see any rash.  About day 3-4 a rash appeared.

Shortly thereafter ambulance arrived on scene at which time it was determined that I would be transported to the hospital. Once there, a series of tests were conducted, one of which was a D-Dimer blood test to rule out blood clots. That resulted in an elevated count to which a CT scan was ordered.   The result of the CT scan revealed that I had 2 Pulmonary Embolisms, one in the upper lobe of my right lung and one in the middle lobe of my right lung.   Due to me being what the doctors said was a healthy 45 year old with no underlying conditions or signs of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) they deemed me low risk at that time and advised I was at low risk of dying in the next 30days. However, they advised that at any time, the clot could possibly become dislodged and cause worse problems, possibly death if time is not given to the body to dissolve the clots. Ultimately it was determined that I be discharged and prescribed blood thinning medications to help thin the blood to prevent further clotting should I have a clotting issue (undetermined at this time).",,,Y,,,,,,N,01/12/2021,01/28/2021,16,1/28/2021---CT Scan of chest and D-Dimer test,OTH,,None,None,None,,,2,02/02/2021,,,Y,None

Monday January 25th: I was at work and started developing a sore throat, chest tightness with some shortness of breath, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and minor chills, although I never had a fever.   Tuesday: symptoms were slightly worse  Wednesday January 27th: I went to work thinking all these symptoms were still just from the vaccine as I hadn't felt any sickness symptoms before getting the vaccine and hadn't had an exposure I was aware of. While at work, I asked other coworkers if they had any similar symptoms to the vaccine and was told I should call employee health since I was still having such bad symptoms and really didn't feel too great. I called the employee health line and told them all my current symptoms which were all the same still. They told me that the sore throat and chest tightness with shortness of breath were definitely not from the vaccine and to leave work and get tested. I did this and my test came back negative. Because I was still having bothersome chest tightness, the employee health line also told me to go to the ER, thinking it could be something else significant.   I went to the ER the night of January 27th to get my symptoms all checked out as told to. Everything came back ok and the ER doctor wanted me tested for COVID again Friday around the 48 hour mark to verify it wasn't the virus. She also told me that if it came back negative, she was sure it must be my reaction to the vaccine.  Thursday January 28th: I stayed home per guidelines from employee health and still had all the symptoms listed on Monday. After a two hour afternoon nap, I finally felt like I was turning the corner. My sore throat felt better besides a huge lump still in my throat and my chest tightness with shortness of breath subsided. I still had bad myalgias, fatigue, headaches and a general sense of not feeling so great.

She calmed down and stopped crying for about five minutes, then started crying again. Her father took her out of the room. When he returned with her 20 minutes later, he said she had stopped crying almost immediately and was fine. I observed her walking, talking, and not in any apparent distress.

She had fallen asleep on the couch about 9:00 pm on 14Jan2021. She woke up about 9:30 pm on 14Jan2021 and had an elevated pulse with chest tightness. She had to go to the emergency room in response to elevated pulse with chest tightness. In the emergency room they were not able to do anything other than hydrate her and all of that but it took about 12-13 more hours for her elevated pulse to come down (15Jan2021). Her biggest question was that she saw where some reactions are fast heart beat but she was kind of surprised at how long after the dose was administered that she had onset of the elevated pulse. She saw Cardiologist 18Jan2021 related to this event and the Cardiologist was a little baffled by the event. She reported event as improved, although she still has a little bit of tightness in her chest which goes in a little bit of phases. The Cardiologist told her to still take the second dose as scheduled of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She did not see her family doctor, she saw the Cardiologist only as referred after emergency room visit. She was not admitted to the hospital; she was treated and kept under observation in the emergency room for about 5.5 hours. She has a stress test scheduled for next week. She is planning to still get the second dose as scheduled of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine but she is a little scared to get it due to this adverse event. She thought the events were related with the vaccine, she had no problem prior to getting the vaccine. On 14Jan2021, pulse was 146 beats per minute which she checked with a pulse oximeter machine she has at home so she knows it is accurate; Chest x-ray: She reported that result of a little atelectasis in lower left lung was a little weird. On 18Jan2021, the EKG result was Normal sinus rhythm but throwing PVCs. She reported she knows her thyroid lab is normal because it was checked in the emergency room during visit starting 14Jan2021. The outcome of the events elevated pulse with chest tightness was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender's Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

I have had complications from Flu shots on multiple occasions for as long as I can remember which lead to fever, diarrhea, upset stomach and other flu like symptoms. I told all my doctors for years about this problem and they blew it off as unimportant. My wife, her friends etc. who are nurses constantly reminded me that I couldn't get the flu from the shot. What I always get may not be the flu but just as severe and this time much worse. There are problems related to this flu vaccine that are not being spoken about, that I know exist and I am an example of it.

Couldn't use CPAP, Nasal congestion aches, Flu symptoms all covered before. 5 days to 7 symptoms continued but lessened. Nasal congestion and chest congestion continued, CPAP couldn't be used. Tried but could only use a short time then woke up not being able to breathe through my nose. No fever noted after day 5 until early 2020 after Holidays.

Start Second Section: 7/25/2020 10:33AM Mainly all conditions remain some better but some worse. Night sweats occur randomly sometime severely with no indication of fever. Breathing with CPAP is helped with the aid of a Cepacol lozenge after putting the CPAP on at night. Works( most )of the time. Legs ache and throb in what seems to upper to lower motion. Worse at night and continuous. Legs hurt at times especially at night changing from location to location. Knees swollen both legs with muscle weakness and loss directly above Knee. This weakness has been getting as time goes on and has led to falls and partial falls. Getting up from a chair and off of the bed has become very uncomfortable and shoe lace tying and putting on shoes and socks is painful in upper leg close to hips. Diarrhea is common place now even though diet is good and I'm taking fiber regularly. No more than 2 normal bowel movements since before Christmas in 2019. Sounds and vibrations in ears and head are constant, stuffy feeling in and around my head and ears, especially the right ear were it was infected this year. Note: infection may have had something to do with rupture in the right ear. I was never notified of rupture before this infection although I was aware of damage to my left ear drum back in the 60s. Walking has become more difficult and always associated with discomfort and at times minor pain . I have heavier Breathing and more rapid Heartbeat when exerting myself but no pain other symptoms. I still cannot sense temperature differences hot or cold on my skin in normal surroundings. Finger tips did show extended pain during colder spring days much like frostbite but it wasn't a freezing day. These ad-on remarks are consistent with my previous remarks in section 1. Some in section 1 that aren't mentioned here Still remain although not mentioned.

I received my second Covid vaccination a few days ago and perhaps the following is related, but I?m not sure.  I think I felt fine yesterday morning, and decided to scrub my tub. I was mostly finished when I felt dizzy and went to lie down around 1pm.  A friend texted me asking if I was free for a chat, but I wanted to rest a little and did so, texting her when I awoke.  I did feel out of sorts when I awoke, and was aware that I had had some dreams, but texted her anyway.  We agreed to have a call at 2pm.  While on the call, I felt I was struggling with the conversation.  I was trying to tell her of my experiences with a recent part-time job (which I quit) and couldn?t remember names of people I worked with or certain events that I wished to convey.  I still can?t remember names of people with whom I worked, and it was just one week ago that I left.  I suddenly felt really out of it and nauseous, and struggled to tell my friend I needed to get off the phone.  I could not remember her name, to tell her this (and I've known her for 40 years)!   The next few hours are a total fog.  I know I was having dreams of a sort, but I was not asleep.  There are maybe 2 hours that I can?t account for. It is most troubling to me that I can?t account for this time, but I know something was happening with my brain and while I was having these dreams or hallucinations, I was not asleep. I remember having to think really hard about what my son-in-law?s name was ? note that I live with this person.  I did not seek medical care, but feel like this information could be related to the Covid vaccine, and may be important to you.  It was my night to cook, and I had a really hard time keeping up.  I did manage to pull most of a meal together, but right before I was done, I needed to call my daughter to finish it.  I was unable to eat anything myself, and only wanted a drink.  I felt really nauseous and unsteady, although my thinking was a bit more clear by this time.  I?m not sure when the numbness in my toes and fingers on one side of my body (right side) started, but as of this afternoon, both are still numb and weak.  It is 1:00pm and I am still having trouble remembering some things, and that few hours of the afternoon from yesterday are completely lost to me.  I have like a shadow hanging above one eye. I am seriously thinking I have had some sort of a neurological event.

She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn't feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn't experiencing any anaphylaxis that I've experienced in past allergic episodes.

It was constant and every time I got up to walk around my BPM (on my Fitbit) went up to about 120. I am normally around  70 and even when sitting still it was 80-95. I went to urgent care around 1 and saw Dr. They checked my blood pressure several times and it was between 118-126/84 (normal for me is about 105/70).  They did a PCR test for COVID but later called to tell me the sample was mislabeled. In the meantime I went to a rapid testing site and got an antigen test that was negative.  Dr opinion was that the reaction was most likely an immune response to the vaccine.  He said I should go in if symptoms last longer than 1-2 more days or if they get worse.  They said I could repeat the PCR test if I needed to be seen again but felt pretty confident about the antigen test results. I am still having the same symptoms tonight, the same severity.  I have no other symptoms of COVID and did not have any other vaccine side effects besides expected/mild ones. I had  a little shortness of breath last night before bed but the chest pain didn?t start until today.

The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.

Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller's grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5'5-1/2"". Reported her mother couldn't walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother's brain wanted her to move, but her mother's legs wouldn't move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn't need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn't able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother's lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn't keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother's cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother's cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother's cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother's cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother's cough was not constant, but her mother's cough was congested. She said she didn't know when her mother's cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn't even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn't anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother's side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn't that her mother was not walking, but that her mother's foot wouldn't move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother's lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn't have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn't move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn't walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn't move. The caller said her mother said she couldn't move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother's brain said ""go"", and her body said ""not now"".

This literature marketed report has been received from the authors of a published literature article, titled as stated above and refers to a 3-year-old, male patient (boy), with a history of infections: recurrent acute otitis media and one occurrence of pneumonia, that required hospitalization.  Complement factor I (CFI) deficiency was a rare disorder with 38 reported cases worldwide. The immune system had adaptive and innate pathways. The complement system was part of the innate pathway, which, through proteolytic reactions, cleared immune complexes and opsonized and kills microbial pathogens. The deficiency of CFI led to complement dysregulation through C3 convertase overactivation and low C3 levels, resulting in decreased bacterial opsonization, phagocytosis, and macrophage activation complex killing. In addition, CFI deficiency caused increased susceptibility to autoimmune/autoinflammatory ailments such as systemic lupus erythematosus, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), glomerulonephritis, encephalitis, and macular degeneration.  On an unknown date before the presentation, the patient was vaccinated with Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) (manufacturer unknown) (dose, strength, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis.  On an unspecified date, the patient presented to the immunology clinic for decreased complement component 3 (C3) levels with glomerulonephritis. Previously, during evaluation for chronic constipation, he was found to have microscopic hematuria. He had normal kidney function, complete blood cell count, and blood pressure. A pediatric nephrology evaluation revealed, that he had low levels of C3 at 28 to 36 mg/dL on 3 different laboratory samples. Notably, antinuclear (ANA) antibody, antistreptolysin O, and C4 were normal. Renal biopsy result was also normal, thus excluding glomerulopathy or C3 nephritic factor as diagnoses. It was reported, that the patient's mother had ulcerative colitis and asthma. There was no other family history of atopic disease, immunodeficiencies, or autoimmune disorders.   At the presentation time, immunologic evaluation revealed normal serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin M. He had normal IgG antibody titers to diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid. He exhibited nonprotective IgG titers to Hemophilus influenzae type B (antibody test abnormal) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Flow cytometry revealed normal memory and class-switched B cells. The patient had a decreased C3 level of 36 mg/dL and undetectable levels in total hemolytic complement (CH50) and serum complement, alternate pathway (AH50) assays. The C4 level was normal. An evaluation performed at the laboratory revealed decreased complement components 5, 8, and 9 (C5, C8, and C9) and complement factors B, H, and I, indicating a likelihood of alternative pathway overactivation. The results were as followed (microgram/mL): C1q of 111, C1r of 73, C1s of 117, C2 of 21.5, C5 of below 17 (low (L)), C6 of 31, C7 of 97.8, C8 of 36 (L), C9 of 17 (L), factor B of below 114 (L), factor D of 2.32, factor H of 75 (L), factor I of below 13 (L). Other results included: C3 of 36 (mg/dL) (L), C4 of 20 (mg/dL), CH50 of below 17 (U/mL) (L) and AH50 of 0 (U/mL) (L).   Subsequently, genetic studies of C5 and factors I, B, and H, identified compound heterozygous mutations of complement factor 1 (CFI), c1253A >T (p.his418leu) and c.772G >A (p.ala258thr), which have been previously reported as pathogenic. The c.1253A >T mutation in exon 11 caused reduced protein expression, whereas the c.772G4A mutation of exon 5 led to erroneous mRNA. Thus, the patient's clinical, laboratory, and genetic manifestations confirmed a CFI deficiency. On an unknown date, the patient was prescribed daily amoxicillin, as prophylaxis for infection.  On an unspecified date, he also received a repeat immunization to Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) type B with Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) (manufacturer unknown) (dose, strength, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not reported) (inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered). The patient also received his first pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (reported as PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE, POLYVALENT (23-VALENT) (Injection,  , ) (PNEUMOVAX23) or ""PPSV23"") and unspecified ""meningococcal conjugate vaccine"".  After immunizations, he exhibited protective antibody titers to H. influenzae type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae. He had regular follow-ups with the pediatric immunology and nephrology clinic and was monitored closely for infections, progressive renal disease, and in particular, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The outcome of the event of antibody test abnormal was recovered/resolved.  The CFI deficiency was a rare primary immunodeficiency, that led to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections and non-infectious presentations such as rheumatologic, renal, dermatologic, and neurologic disease. The CFI gene was located on chromosome 4q25 and generates a 88 kDa glycoprotein, that was principally produced by the liver. Furthermore, CFI was an acute-phase reactant, and it's expression was up-regulated by interleukin-6 in hepatocytes. The patients with CFI deficiency were susceptible to invasive bacterial infections, with up to 81 % of affected individuals presenting in such a manner. Among genetically confirmed cases, there was a slight preponderance in women (2.2:1) and childhood onset. No clear relationship currently existed between CFI mutations and the resulting clinical phenotype of CFI deficiency. Of note, there were cases of siblings, who shared a CFI genotype, but even though the proband developed pathogenic manifestations, the sibling remained asymptomatic. Autoimmune ailments were associated with CFI deficiency, some of which could be life-threatening. An example of such an ailment was aHUS, which was characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury resulting from microthrombi in the small blood vessels. The penetrance of aHUS in patients with CFI mutations was approximately 50 %. The prognosis for aHUS was extremely poor, with approximately 60 % of patients progressing to end-stage renal failure. Renal transplantation in patients with aHUS who had CFI mutations has been associated with a high recurrence rate and especially poor prognosis. In CFI deficiency, there was unregulated activation of the alternative complement pathway, that subsequently activated the terminal complement pathway, with C5 activation and generation of C5a and C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC), leading to elevations in plasma levels of C5a and C5b-9. The C5b-9 MAC complex might have been caused inflammation, endothelial cell activation, neutrophil activation, hemolysis, or thrombosis. Eculizumab is a humanized anti-C5 monoclonal antibody that binds to the alfa chain of C5 and prevents the generation of C5a and C5b by the C5 convertase, causing down-regulation of C5a anaphylatoxin and C5b-C9 MAC, thereby decreasing inflammation. The eculizumab has been approved for the treatment of aHUS.  Currently, the treatment for CFI deficiency was limited to antimicrobial prophylaxis through vaccination against encapsulated bacterial pathogens. Although there was no empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in CFI deficiency, this was commonly used to prevent serious infections. Direct replacement of CFI using fresh frozen plasma or purified CFI had resulted in transient correction of in vitro assays of complement activity. However, fresh frozen plasma infusions were associated with anaphylaxis, and long-term clinical outcomes have not been reported. Bone marrow transplantation was not a potentially curative strategy given that CFI synthesis occurred in the liver. Of note, CFI deficiency was a rare but likely underdiagnosed cause of primary immunodeficiency and/or immune dysregulation. The diagnosis of CFI deficiency should be considered in patients with recurrent infections and/or renal, dermatologic, rheumatologic, neurologic disturbances, along with low C3 levels. Early identification was important, because it allowed for the initiation of prophylactic measures to prevent severe infections and other systemic sequelae. The causality between the suspect vaccination and the event of antibody test abnormal was assessed by the authors to be related.

The rash was fading but was still pretty obvious. She was a healthcare worker. She didn't notice any reaction for a couple of weeks. A week before or maybe a week and a half before (in Jan2021), she noticed dermatitis on her whole body. The dermatologist said she possibly had a reaction to the COVID vaccine. He told her to take Benadryl and Zyrtec. She saw him on Wednesday of last week and today (18Jan2021) was Monday. This rash was incredibly itchy. She thought it was fading a little bit. The second dose was due on the 20th, which was the day after tomorrow (20Jan2021). She read in the materials she was given that people who had serious reactions shouldn't get the second dose. Also she had had some muscle cramping in the stomach. She didn't have a follow up with the Dermatologist. She was assuming she should continue taking Zyrtec and Benadryl. Caller clarified that she got the generic, not the brand names. She took one Zyrtec a day that was 10mg. She took the Benadryl substitute and it was every 4 to 6 hours.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient's concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient's left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn't report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient's heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient's sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient's, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it's not available. The patient's sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues.

She said all her other blood work is very good. She said if she takes IMBRUVICA her white blood cell count goes down to 30000. She said IMBRUVICA will initially quadruple her white blood cell count before the IMBRUVICA will make her white blood cell count go down. She said she is mostly on the IMBRUVICA. She said if she tries to go off IMBRUVICA her White Blood Cell count goes up. The patient is calling about the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. She received the first dose of vaccine 09Jan2021, and the patient had an immediate reaction ""breathy"". She said she had a reaction right when she got the COVID-19 Vaccine, and now it is the 11th day already and she is beside herself. The patient reported that on 09Jan2021 from the injection site of the COVID-19 Vaccine, she immediately felt heat go down her arms and legs. She said she was told to go sit for a while, and that what she was experiencing would pass. She said what she experienced didn't pass. She said she got ""chemo shakes"", clarifying she had a kind of shivering or uncontrolled shakes. Reported she had to go to the bathroom 3 times while she was waiting for her side effects to improve. She clarified she had loose bowels. She said her bowels were good after the 1st week of receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, but yesterday or 2 days ago, she had loose bowel movements. She said the bowel movements were not liquid, but the bowel movements were not normal. She had stayed at the vaccination facility site for over an hour after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she couldn't walk, clarifying that her legs were almost paralyzed feeling, and she couldn't get a walking gate on her legs.

All events happened on 09Jan2021.She has CLL, clarifying she has Leukemia. On unspecified date in Jan2021, she found lumps (clarified as enlarged lymph nodes) under her neck 4 days after she stopped taking IMBRUVICA. She said the enlarged lymph nodes started to come back on her neck sooner than she expected. She clarified if she stops taking IMBRUVICA in preparation for a dental visit, she can be off of IMBRUVICA for 2 weeks and not have enlarged lymph nodes come back on her neck like after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is attacking her lymph nodes. She said she doesn't like mixing 2 medications (IMBRUVICA and COVID-19 Vaccine), but will have to go back on the IMBRUVICA, and hope her enlarged lymph nodes will go down. She said her cancer doctor told her not to take IMBRUVICA until she was feeling better. She clarified that IMBRUVICA is not a chemo medication. She said the last time she had chemo was when she had spiked in 2015 and had 4 chemo treatments. Also, it was reported that on 09Jan2021, she has flushing in her face, and her face feels hot, her nose and cheeks get a sunburn heat feeling, and the heat feeling is on and off, her skin on her arms and legs starts to feel prickly when she has the heat feeling on her nose and cheeks.

She said her cancer doctor recommended she get the COVID-19 Vaccine because all her blood work looked good before she got the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. she doesn't have a spleen because she had a bad accident 25 years ago. She said maybe her not having a spleen creates the sensitivity she is having to the COVID-19 Vaccine (onset date in Jan2021). She said she doesn't get the flu vaccine. She said she looked at the papers she was given when she got the COVID-19 Vaccine and wanted to notify Pfizer and see if she could get some help as to what she should do. She said she asked her cancer doctor what she should do, and he told her he is not an expert. She said she has had every side effect listed on the COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, but she doesn't have the blushing on her face that was listed on the paperwork. She said Pfizer should have a hotline for people to check in. She said she wants to know that she is doing the right thing, and that the COVID-19 Vaccine is not killing her. She asked if she is getting blood work in 3 weeks, will the blood work show if she has antibodies from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She was offered transfer to Pfizer Medical Information for further assistance. She forgot to mention that as soon as she got the COVID-19 Vaccine, she had a bitter taste in her mouth on 09Jan2021. She said when she starts getting hot in her cheeks, the bitter taste comes back in her mouth. Reported usually by 4:00PM she starts getting the heat in her face, but no temperature.

She said it is like the body goes through shock and is trying to get back into balance. She called the specialty pharmacist to see if there was anything in the COVID-19 Vaccine that could interact with the IMBRUVICA. She said the specialty pharmacist told her there is nothing interactive with the COVID-19 Vaccine because the COVID-19 Vaccine is not a live vaccination. Reported she is allergic to sulfur. She said she feels like she has a sulfur burn on her face, if she didn't have the heat on her face too. She said the enlarged lymph nodes on her neck below her chin are very stressful. She said every side effect listed on the COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork; she has. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork mentioned lymph nodes.
