Management was discussed with the cardiology resident and I supervised the plan of care. I have reviewed and agree with the key parts of the resident evaluation including:  Subjective information Objective findings on physical exam Impression and plan Gen: appears comfortable, sitting in bed Resp: clear. no wheezes, rhonchi, rales CV: normal rate, regular, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: warm, no edema. Pressure ulcer boots on. Pleasant 70-year-old woman who had a history of PVCs, left bundle branch block, and a mild nonischemic cardiomyopathy, came into the hospital following a VT/VF cardiac arrest. Her echocardiogram done while in the hospital showed a preserved ejection fraction. Her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. She had implantation of an ICD. Hospital course has been complicated by watershed cerebral infarcts. In addition, she had an episode of C. difficile colitis. She has gradually improved over the course of the past 3 weeks. From a cardiovascular perspective, she is being discharged on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her home atorvastatin. With regards to her etiology of cardiac arrest, I would be suspicious about the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, we were not able to get a cardiac MR while she was inpatient due to her strokes and inability to consistently follow commands and hold her breath. Would recommend consideration of an outpatient. She is ready to discharge to subacute rehab today. I have spent greater than 30 minutes in discharge planning.  Preferred Name: PATIENT  PCP: DO Primary Cardiologist:  MD Discharging Cardiologist: MD Admission Date: 3/5/2021 Admission Diagnosis: Cardiac arrest  Discharge Date: 03/26/21 Discharge Summary Author:  DO Primary Discharge Diagnosis VT/VF cardiac arrest, s/p therapeutic hypothermia S/p AICD placement 3/16/2021 Secondary Discharge Diagnoses Anoxic brain injury, recovering, with persistent aphasia and dysphagia C. difficile colitis Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, resolved DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness Patient is a 70 y.o. female, with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted on 3/5/2021 after out of hospital VT/VF cardiac arrest. She completed therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Cardiac catheterization did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. TTE showed LVEF 55%. Patient underwent AICD placement on 3/16/2021. Had some recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia afterward, which resolved after increasing her carvedilol doses. Her course was complicated by a C. difficile infection, treated with PO Vancomycin, with significant improvement in diarrhea. She has had gradual neurologic recovery. Neurology felt she had had several watershed infarcts, but felt that she would continue to have a prolonged recovery over the next few months. Had some recovery of language/cognition prior to discharge. Due to her waxing/waning encephalopathy, she did not qualify for inpatient rehab, but will be discharged to subacute rehab. Discharged with tube feeding continued, though she can begin sips with speech therapy supervision. Patient seen and examined at bedside on the day of discharge. She stated that she had no pain, though HPI/ROS still limited due to aphasia. Discussed above information with patient's husband, who understood and was in agreement with the plan.  Problem-Based Hospital Course NEURO Acute metabolic encephalopathy, with gradual recovery -Due to neurologic injury from cardiac arrest. -Neurology consult: concern for anoxic brain injury with watershed infarcts, anticipate very gradual recovery over the coming months. No acute process on imaging. -Patient extubated on 3/11, following some commands. Continuing to regain conversational ability and motor function gradually each day. Has some waxing and waning of mental status, but overall her encephalopathy  continues to improve. -Limit centrally acting/sedating medications -Speech following for language/cognition as well as dysphagia requiring tube feeding. Can begin some sips in addition to tube feeds. -Continue tube feeds via tube per instructions provided on after visit summary INFECTIOUS DISEASE C. Difficile Colitis: -C.Diff Positive 3/18. Continue 125 mg PO Vancomycin Q6H for 10 days (3/18 - 3/27), confirmed with infectious disease -Frequency of diarrhea has decreased significantly, was stable after rectal tube removed 2-3 days prior to discharge Pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, resolved -s/p 5 day course ceftriaxone (3/5 - 3/9 ) -CTA on admission showed significant RUL and RLL consolidation with air bronchograms, as well as some patchy airspace disease in LUL -Had copious tan sputum on suctioning 3/7 - respiratory culture negative CARDIOLOGY Out of hospital cardiac arrest, likely VT/VF -Pt's husband initiated chest compressions x 10 minutes, until police/fire dept arrival, when AED showed a shockable rhythm. Likely VT/VF arrest. -S/p therapeutic hypothermia protocol. -Troponin peaked at 1.09 -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), resolved Chronic left bundle branch block -Has had multiple episodes of NSVT noted on telemetry 3/19 - 3/20 -s/p ICD as above -Increased dose of Carvedilol to 25 mg BID with resolution of NSVT  History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 55% -Echo in 11/2019 demonstrated EF 42% (nadir). -TTE on admission showed recovered EF to 55%, mild concentric LVH, normal RV systolic function, no valvular abnormalities -Was initially started on aspirin/statin due to high suspicion for CAD, but as cardiac cath 3/15 was unremarkable, these medications were discontinued. -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Hypertension -Blood pressure now improved after restarting home lisinopril and initiating carvedilol -HCTZ discontinued as BP now well controlled on above regimen  RENAL Oliguria, resolved -Pt initially had low urine output since admission, improved to 0.5 cc/kg/hr on 3/9.

She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed ""brain fog"" and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies <1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- > 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.

The E.R. Dr  diagnosed me with epiplogic appendagitis, and instructed me to rest, hydrate, and take tylenol. I followed the Drs advice.

I began having what I'd term as cognitive issues. Trouble focusing. Blurred vision. Confusion. My synapsis weren't synapping. My brain and mouth didn't work. I felt like inside my body was shaking. But visibly, outside, was nothing. At that time, I was managing diabetes and I figured it was related to victoza being stopped since I'm not a diabetic now. And it continued about 7 days. Then, dwindled for a few, but it returned. I then began getting panicked about it and having panic attacks. I'm afraid of dementia, and remembering was an issue.  It continued 4 days off 4 days on. Oddly enough. The 3rd week, it went away about 3 days in. I had about 7 days of bliss, but on the 4th day I got vaccination number 2. At this point, troubleshooting, I quit all my medications. I thought the issue was meditation related. I got shot number two and 3 days later, it hit and stayed again. 4 days on. 4 days off. By this time, I figured it is not my medications. So I went to my Dr. We did an MRI. Carotid workup. We did every test known to man, inluding heavy metals and found no anomalies except I was dehydrated. So I increased water and raised kidney functions. Weeks went by like this. Off and on. Dr finally told me I had toxic metabolic encephalopathy and I could have died. All testing rules out everything except vaccination reactions. He said my body didn't recognize the vaccine and that my brain attacked the toxins and swellee and caused the TME because of that. I want others to know. TMEs can be deadly. Your brain can swell, and you can die. Fortunately I'm on the upswing. But I still worry about memory. I forget appointments.  I still am for the vaccinations. But we never know how our own bodies will react. My physicians diagnosis is a TME caused by Pfizer vaccine. He has ruled everything else out.  I advocate this vaccinaction. Do it. I think what I went through is rare. But interestingly enough, online, it states 23 percent of covid victims get TME.  I didn't have Covid. I've tested negative.

I went to work that week, but by Friday (March 30th) I was not able to handle the pain so after work I went to the doctor and they took blood to see if there was anything going on. The result came back the following day and everything was normal. I was given medicine (muscle relaxers) for the occipital pain, but it was not enough. At that time I was not sure what was the cause of it, I thought it was a bad flu, but I didn't come to the conclusion that it was because of the vaccine, because a week had passed by, so I thought it was impossible. The doctor asked for me to take an X-Ray for the occipital pain, so I did (March 30th) and it resulted in everything being fine. She also recommended for me to get an abdominal ultrasound to see if my uterus was fine due to the second period. I currently took the second Pfizer dose in the same location, but this time around I felt all of these symptoms within 3 hours of the vaccination.

I estimate the vaccine has aged my already damaged nervous system by about 25 years. As I figure out how to safely work my farm with my new limitations, I take time to report my adverse reactions to help my fellow ""numbies"" avoid similar neurologic damage due to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and may you have treatments to reverse it? PRE-EXISTING NEUROLOGIC STATE: moderate, stress-hormone-induced peripheral ganglian neuropathy. Began 2007 in right foot. Diagnosed December 2012 by physician. At time of diagnosis (December 2012), approximately 1% feeling remaining in right foot, more, but farfrom 100%, feeling elsewhere. Just before 1st Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (mid March 2021), approximately 0.1% feeling in right foot and 0.5 -1% feeling elsewhere. Active, full-time farmer. Physical therapy exercises for left ankle and hammer toe help with balance, but a fall or serious near-fall (requiring PT or bandages) about once a year due to numbness. Able to walk on uneven ground and slippery surfaces and safely recover from slips & gopher holes. Through yoga, no longer slightly incontinent. Able to drive, walk, hike, swim, carry 20lb plants & trash bags on uneven surfaces, heavy gardening live independently, cook, care for own self = normal life! SUNDAY MARCH 21, 2021:  6:13 p.m. First COVID 19 vaccine in left arm. 6:43 p.m. Released from waiting room, nerves feel normal Approx 7:15 pm: At home, seated in midst of preparing dinner: Increase in numbness in left-side of lips & minor left-side of mouth. Approx 7:18 pm: Numbness spreads to right lips and minor right-side of mouth Approx 7:20 pm: Tingling begins on lips and minor mouth, maybe more on the right side Approx 7:25 pm: minor ""popping"" in each ear, like when driving up a mountain, once in each ear Approx 8:30 p.m-10p.m.: seated at home computer doing bookkeeping. Tingling in feet, especially right foot. When I walk around, right knee seems very numb MONDAY MARCH 22, 2021: (morning after vaccine) Approx6am.: Very numb in right foot, right ankle, right calf, and right knee. Maybe 0.001% feeling remaining. A decrease of 99% in 12hours. My most sudden decrease ever! Test my balance by standing on one leg. For the first time in my recollection, my balance is worse on my right leg than my left leg (left ankle prone to sprains). I am alarmed, but event is similar to the many numbing events I have had before (except the lip part rear part). Start calling docs once their offices open. Neurologist out of town. Continue normal work at farm, but slower and extra careful on uneven surfaces. TUESDAY MARCH 23, 2021: (2 days after vaccine) Phone appointment with internist. Recomends my getting the 2nd vaccine in 3weeks. WEDNESDAY MARCH 31, 2021: (10 days after vaccine) In-person appointment with orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon for new numbness, the usual left ankle, 2020 hammertoes and January 2021 near fall. Wrote physical therapy eval/treatment prescription for balance THURSDAY APRIL 1, 2021: (11 days after vaccine) In-person physical therapy eval for balance by physical therapist (test reports enclosed) SATURDAY APRIL 3, 2021: (13 days after vaccine) Unusual numbing even for me. Working at farm in office. Walking normally and turning left into hallway (slightly leaning towards the left like a motorcycle turning), I suddenly release about 1 teaspoon of urine (unusual for me). At first I thought my bladder must be full (I have almost no sensation for the need to urinate), but as I sat on the toilet only a few tablespoons to a quarter cup flow out. Thinking that maybe the left turn has put something out of whack, I did my three most reliable, safe, gentle, work-appropriate exercises: yoga's uttanasana (forward bend on ledge), yoga's utthita trikonasana (triangle pose), PT stroke recovery's marching with opposite arm swings. Instead of helping, within half an hour of the urine leak, my whole right side was pretty much completely numb (0.0001% feeling) Approximately 0.01% feeling on left side. THURSDAY APRIL 8th, 2020 (18 days after vaccine) Phone appointment with neurologist. Concerned about possible nerve delamination. Brain and partial spine MRI scheduled for Monday April 26, in-person follow up scheduled for Wednesday May 5th. Doc or I will provide VAERS with updates APRIL 6, 12, 13, 14: Caught myself just before begining to fall. I am getting so little signal from my nerves that I have to rely mostly on sight, musclememory, and paying attention to walking & standing. PT had suggested walking farm, but they bother my tennis elbow and at my farm I often need to carry a plant of box or something from here to there. If numbness stays the same or gets worse, I would not feel safe farming unless I could modify many aspects of growing areas & parking areas (both asphalt & gophery grass) and had high level orchid grower help plus some just physical work help. APRIL 12th: Public swimming pool is finally open! 15 minutes of PT balance excecises and 25 minutes of freestyle swim and breastroke pull. Afterwards I feel so much better! No change in numbness, but I had no idea how jaded my nerves had been until they finally were calmer. Perhaps this is a hopeful sign that the numbness it temporary. I swim again on Friday the 16th. Let's be hopeful! The End!

On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn't help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn't stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn't move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn't get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn't shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn't stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn't sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn't stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing.

I had to crawl to the bathroom on my hands and knees. I called out sick for work due to this and contacted my DR. I was started meclizine 25 mg 3 times a day for vertigo, and was taking Zofran to help. 1/31/21 noted my Re upper eyelid was doing a lot of spastic twitching at times, that would stop and start, but did not think about it much.  The vertigo was unrelenting and then I started to have Right arm and hand weakness noted on 2/3/21 and was still very dizzy, nauseated and had a constant headache since I got dose #2 of the COVID vaccine on 1/22.  I was using a walking stick for the dizziness to be stable, and also felt weaker on the R side, and drifting to the right when walking .On 2/4/21 I had my first MRI (no contrast, unfortunately) and noticed I could not fully shut my Right eye in the MRI, and by 2/5/21 my face was drooping. I still had the constant headache, nausea and dizziness, and increased R hand, arm and R leg weakness and R hip weakness. I could not lift my R leg up to walk well, cannot grip well with the R hand, and uncoordinated, and cannot walk straight, and am unstable when trying to walk heel to toe, or even stand still with my eyes shut, and have had some double vision with the R eye. I was started on Prednisone  and on Klonopin for the vertigo on 2/9 after seeing my neurologist.  I took Prednisone for 5 days, from 2/9-2/13 and did not have improvement with the R facial droop or R side weakness and the headaches have persisted, along with some dizziness and nausea.  on2/14-15 I had increased shortness of breath and R lung felt like it was not inflating much, and got an xray, and went onto Zithromax for 5 days, which did help my lungs to improve, and I was able to breathe better, and got my Right lung capacity back.    I stopped the Klonopin after a week (2/9-2/16), to manage through the symptoms without it, and have been doing physical therapy and. Vestibular therapy. I had another MRI, with contrast on 2/25, after an in-person neurology appointment, and was having some improvement with the vertigo, so I started back to a desk job, not my RN job on 3/4/21, but I was still having the constant headache, nausea, and some dizziness, R face droop, R hand weakness, R leg weakness and walk with a walking stick, and have increased issues with exertion, but have been walking and doing therapies to get stronger.3 I started to have increased R facial droop.

The patient's weight was 250 pounds and was obese (body mass index 40) and sedentary. His height was not provided. The patient's concurrent conditions included high blood pressure, and 2 gout attacks in the last 8 months. The last gout attack was 2 weeks ago in the left foot. There was no history of clots or atrial fibrillation. He had a strong family history of thrombosis: his father had 2 episodes of deep vein thrombosis and his mother had a pulmonary embolism. No testing to identify any familial clotting issues have been performed. The patient developed a cough starting 29-MAR-2021 and, prior to vaccination, took a COVID-19 test on 31-MAR-2021 which was negative. On 02-APR-2021 a rapid COVID-19 test also came back negative.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 043A21A, and expiry: UNKNOWN) on 02-APR-2021 at approximately 19:00 in the left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan for high blood pressure. On 03-APR-2021, the patient's cough persisted but had not worsened and he developed pain in the ribs on the right. His wife checked his pulse, which seemed fast and irregular. His respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation with a home pulse oximeter was in the 70s. He was not in distress at the time. The patient called his physician and the doctor suggested to go to Emergency room. The patient went to Emergency room at approximately 10:00. An echocardiogram revealed a number of clots in the right ventricle which were ""bouncing all around"". He was also found to be in atrial fibrillation which the doctors said was secondary to the ventricular clots. Unspecified tests revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus and a deep vein thrombosis on the left.  He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), blood clots in right ventricle and atrial fibrillation. Platelet count was not known by the reporter; it is unknown if  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were performed.  He underwent emergency surgery at 19:00, during which most of the ventricular clots and the pulmonary embolism were removed. He was placed on heparin after the surgery. He spent 5 days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 2 additional days in the hospital.

The reporter did not believe that the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s had caused deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clot in right ventricle This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender's Comments: V0:  a 68-year-old male experienced left deep vein thrombosis, saddle pulmonary embolism, right ventricular thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation, approximately 15 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  The patient has a history of hypertension, is obese (BMI 40) and has a strong family history of blood clots.  He tested negative for COVID 2 days before and the day of vaccine administration.  He developed a cough 4 days prior to vaccination. The morning after vaccination, he developed right rib pain; his heart rate was rapid and irregular, and oxygen saturation with home pulse oximeter was in the 70s.  Upon arrival in the emergency room, he was found to have clots in the right cardiac ventricle, a saddle pulmonary embolus, left deep vein thrombosis and new-onset atrial fibrillation.  He underwent surgery for removal of the ventricular clots and pulmonary embolism.  No laboratory details were provided.  Given the symptoms which pre-dated vaccine administration,  the short latency between the vaccine administration and the event, and multiple risk factors for embolism and thrombosis (family history, obesity, sedentary nature), the events are assessed as inconsistent with the causal association to immunization, per the WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization.

Information on the pt's concurrent conditions, medical history or concomitant therapy was not reported. It was reported that she was happy and physically very active without autonomic issues, no tachycardia, and no orthostasis; she had met all expected developmental milestones to that point; she was a good student and was doing very well in her classes; and was very physically active and enjoyed spending time with her friends. On 05-NOV-2012 during a physical examination, the pt's pediatrician recommended that pt receive quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) vaccine an on the same date (at the age of 14), and under the consent of pt's mother, the pt. was vaccinated with a first dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) for prevention of cervical cancer (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). Soon after the pt. was vaccinated with the first dose, she developed symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Pt. and her parents noticed an increase of hair growing on pt's face and chest. On 04-FEB-2013 (at the age of 15), the pt. returned to the pediatrician's office to receive the second dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) for prevention of cervical cancer (lot#, expiration date, dose, route of administration and anatomical location were not reported). It was after this second shot of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) that pt. began to experience symptoms of dysautonomia, such as trembling, shaking, chest pressure, palpitations, and headaches. On 18-MAR-2013 and on 28-MARCH-2013, the pt. was taken to the hospital for episodes of chest pains, dizziness, and tachycardia (unclear if she was admitted to the hospital due to the events). As the months progressed, so did pt's injuries. She was seen by multiple physicians and specialists for her complaints which now included: dizziness; chest pains; trouble breathing; presyncope; tachycardia and heart palpitations; nausea and stomach cramps; decreased appetite; excessive fatigue; difficulty concentrating; unrefreshing sleep; vertigo; low blood pressure; blurry vision and visual disturbances; cold and clammy extremities; heat intolerance; chronic migraines; and menstrual irregularities. Therefore, it was claimed, that the pt. sustained autoimmune disease and other serious injuries, including but not limited to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (""POTS""), orthostatic intolerance (""OI""), and autonomic dysfunction as a result of his quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) injections. It was claimed that quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) and its ingredients caused pt's autoimmune disease and other related injuries and resulted in her suffering from severe, debilitating, disabling and painful chronic injuries. As a result of her post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms, pt. was unable to engage in normal activities that a normal teenager would enjoy. She had trouble keeping up with classes during her sophomore year of high school and did the majority of this grade at home. Pt. was unable to attend college classes on campus due to her extreme fatigue. Based upon her chronic and severe post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms and adverse events as outlined above and the tests performed by dozens of medical providers, pt had been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to POTS, OI, autonomic dysfunction, hypoaldosteronism, hirsutism, and chronic migraines. As a proximate result of vaccination, pt. had suffered and continued to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries and associated symptomology and had suffered severe and permanent emotional injuries, including pain and suffering. Pt. also had a substantial fear of suffering additional and ongoing harms, including but not limited to now being at an increased risk of cancer and future symptoms and harms associated with her autoimmune disease as a result of her exposure to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL). At the reporting time, she was not recover from the events. The reporter considered all events to be disabling and related to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL).",,,,,,,,Y,N,11/05/2012,,,,PVT,,,,,,US0095075132104USA002585,2,04/15/2021,,Y,,

Two days after vaccine he had seizures (details not reported.) Five days after vaccine, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after slumping over while driving with ""foam coming out"" of his mouth. Doctors noted that he had heart arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. ""X-rays"" were done that showed no blockage and no heart attack. The patient was intubated. Doctors also noted brain swelling due to a lack of oxygen. 10 days after vaccine, the patient woke up from his coma and was out of ICU. The patient's long-term memory (things that happen 5-10 years ago and earlier) was intact, but his short-term memory had been compromised. He was unable to complete normal motor skills like walking and dressing. An internal cardiac defibrillator was placed. At the time of this report, patient was in rehab and recovering. The lethargy is likely related to vaccine.

I have constant red rashes that appear  ? My face has been swollen for 39 days now and has not gone back to normal once since this all started.  ? During the weekend of March 6th, I was outside in my yard mulching, pulling out dead plants and planting new ones.  ? March 8th, 2021, I woke up with a swollen LEFT forearm. Went to urgent care. Told to ice and take Aleve. ? On March 9, 2021, I woke up with a swollen face only on LEFT side and went back to urgent care and gave me prednisone 6 days to take.  ? On March 12th, my arm was healing but my face was not and ended up swollen on both sides so I went to a different urgent care and they started me on antibiotics but didn?t not have me treated for anything specific because they were unsure what was happening and recommended to see an allergist.  ? On March 15th, is saw an allergist. He said the swollen arm and face were from an allergic reaction so they did round one of allergy testing for environmental, molds, cats/dogs and some food categories since I thought it was from yard work. I tested positive on almost all 80 tests and had to go back on March 17 for the second round of allergy testing and the final results.  ? On March 17th, I finished round two of allergy testing and was mostly positive on everything. The 8 food categories I was only positive for two, soybean and peanuts.  ? I decided to sign up for allergy drops rather than the shots twice a week. In the meantime, of waiting for the drops to get made I was put on more predisone, allergra, and one tablet of hydroxyzine hcl 25mg at night.  ? A week late my face was still swollen and nothing was working. I called the doctor office and they said to double the hydroxyzine at night. ? On March 29th, my face was still EXTREMELY swollen so we did a CT scan. Had bad sinus infection. He removed the Allegra and put me on one Clemastine 2.68mg in the morning. He then sent me for blood work. I went that evening.  ? On March 31st, I went to get my hair done with the same hair stylist and with the same bleach I?ve been doing on my hair for 13+ years with. I have never once broken out or had a reaction but this time I did. My face, neck, chest was boiling red of a rash.  ? On April 5th, I went back and all my blood work was good. However, my face was STILL swollen and hadn?t gone back to normal in since March 7. I stayed on the same meds and started the allergy drops.  ? On April 12th, I went to get my nails done and broke out in another red boiling rash with another reaction. Been going to the same lady for 10+ years and never had a reaction or rash.  ? On April 13th, I went to the dentist and got a filling re done and molded for a retainer to get whitening gel. After the numbing shot and molding, I immediately broke out in a red rash all over, face swelled up way bigger than it already was and within 30 mins couldn?t breathe well and had to use my epi pen. I was able to breathe again.  ? On April 14th, I went back to the doctor because I had a red-hot rash all over my body that will not go away and the doctor said it?s unknown of what?s exactly going on right now. I got put on more prednisone for the rash. I go back on April 21st for a follow up.  38 DAYS LATER and my face has NOT ONCE gone back to normal and rashes are still appearing each day.

She reports she was walking around her house earlier when she suddenly became short of breath.  She denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling but states that shortness of breath persisted.  She denies any tobacco, alcohol or drug use and states she has never had any symptoms similar to this before.  Denies any lung disease or heart disease previously.  She does have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is on metoprolol and rosuvastatin respectively which she reports good compliance.  Denies family history of MI or strokes.  She also denies other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or lower extremity edema.  In the ED vitals were found to be within normal limits.  EKG was obtained showing diffuse T wave inversions, right bundle branch block, no ST changes, no hypertrophy.  Troponin found to be elevated at 0.137, creatinine elevated at 1.3, BUN 26.  Chest x-ray was within normal limits.  Otherwise lab work was unremarkable.  She was given aspirin and Nitropaste Hospital Course:         Patient was admitted to the medical floor and remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay. She actually remained asymptomatic and had no further shortness of breath. She was not hypoxic, at no point required supplemental oxygen. Her troponins however continued to uptrend to 0.389. Cardiology consulted, she was medically optimized with increased statin dose, therapeutic lovenox, and aspirin. Original plan was for cardiac catheterization. However, a d-dimer was ordered which returned elevated to 13.7. CTA was performed which revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with large clot burden and concern for right heart strain. Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV with mild diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation. She was deemed not to be candidate for EKOS. Troponin elevation was felt to be type II NSTEMI 2/2 PE.  PE was classified as unprovoked as she has no definite risk factors for this: no prior DVT/PE, no family history of clotting disorder, no evidence of malignancy (UTD with cancer screenings and visits PCP q6m for health maintenance), no cell line abnormalities, no prolonged immobility or long trips or surgeries, no trauma, no hormone or steroid therapies or even antidepressants. She is obese, and has mild CKD. She tested negative for COVID-19 by antigen testing. The only identifiable change in her health habits recently was receiving the first COVID-vaccine dose on 3/18. We discharged her with Eliquis with instructions to taper from 10BID to 5BID after 7 days. As she will be on anticoagulation, the benefit will likely outweigh the risk of receiving the second COVID dose.  She will follow up with her PCP and hematology/oncology.",,,,,Y,2,,,Y,03/18/2021,03/28/2021,10,03/28/2021:  Chest CTA - Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with overall large clot burden and suggestion of pulmonary arterial hypertension and right heart strain. 03/29/2021:  Cardiac echocardiogram - Conclusion - The left ventricle is normal size. The left ventricular systolic function is normal. LVEF is 60-65%. There is normal LV segmental wall motion. Mild diastolic dysfunction is present (impaired relaxation pattern).

And when the nurses took my temperature it was 97.8. This happened in the course of about 30-40 minutes of my phone call and arriving to the hospital. Either way I was concerned about the pain because I know there would be symptoms following the shot but I didn?t think it would be so severe. After waiting to be checked in and evaluated they proscribed me Tylenol and ibuprofen. But at a location that was closed for the day. I asked if I could just take more pain killers for the pain (midal and Advil) and I was told i could. Once arriving home by 11:30 I took two midal pills and the pain reduced within an hour.

I did not go yet because I would like to wait for at least 28 days after the vaccine to go in and have the blood work done.

The same side as the injection. I didn't think anything of it but as the hour's and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn't hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can't really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn't able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn't have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I've had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I'm in a complete fog and can't shake this feeling. I'm having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I'm drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I'm still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better.

Initial information received on 11-APR-2021 was processed with additional information obtained from telephone follow up with the patient on 15-APR-2021. The patient's weight was 200 pounds and height was 65 inches. The patient's past medical history included COVID-19 infection last year with minimal symptoms and not hospitalized, and concurrent conditions included protein C and protein S deficiencies with ""many previous clots"" with most recent in 2019, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, low iron, low ferritin, low vitamin D, and contrast dye allergy. The patient was previously treated with warfarin for anticoagulation  for 13 years, and 8 months ago was switched to XARELTO.  The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration, dose, vaccination site, and batch number were not reported) administered on 31-MAR-2021 at 10:30 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number would be requested in follow up. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban for anticoagulation.   On 31-MAR-2021 around 19:30, the patient felt very short of breath, had a hard time breathing and ""thought it may be due to a blood clot"" and felt ""like it maybe  getting worse"". She saw hematologist on 14-APR-2021, who, at her request, stopped XARELTO effective15-APR-2021, and started a 2 week course of Lovenox, with plan to start warfarin after that. This was not medically indicated, but requested by patient, and physician agreed. Her oxygen saturation at that visit was normal. On 14-APR-2021, laboratory data included: platelet count (NR: not provided) 470 (units unspecified), and vitamin D (NR: not provided) low at 19 (units unspecified); as treatment ""mega dose"" was ordered to her pharmacy. Her hematologist scheduled a VQ scan for 19-APR-2021 to evaluate for pulmonary embolism. The patient reported the event felt very short of breath, thinks it may be due to blood clot related to COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S. The action taken with COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from the events. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender's Comments: V0: This 32 year-old female with medical history significant for obesity (BMI 33), Protein C & S deficiencies with ""many previous clots"" (most recent in 2019) began to feel very short of breath approximately 9 hours after receiving Janssen Covid-19 vaccination. Other medical history included alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, low ferritin, low vitamin D, allergy to contrast dye, and mild Covid-19 infection last year which did not require hospitalization. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban which was started 8 months ago; warfarin had been used for 13 years prior to rivaroxaban. She felt her difficulty breathing could be a blood clot and went to see her hematologist 2 weeks after vaccination. Rivaroxaban was stopped at her request, not because it was medically indicated, and enoxaparin was started with a plan to start warfarin 2 weeks later.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 9.64 after one round of the vaccine. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 220 natural antibodies after 2 months.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient reports that he had worked for an urgent care performing testing and contracted COVID-19 back in 11SEP2020. Patient was hospitalized for 7 days, was administered Remdesivir, and had a long recovery. Patient reports having issues regulating his blood pressure and heart rate so bad that he had almost died during that time. The recovery took up until 1st week of October and did not feel well until then. Patient reports it was advised to defer first dose of vaccination for COVID-19 for 3 months.   Patient self-medicated with OTC Tylenol and Advil which did not help. Patient reports that he was hospitalized a second time around last month (03MAR2021 approximately) for experiencing a stroke. Symptoms felt like he was experiencing a mini-COVID-19 episode and was having a relapse of COVID-19. ER professional advised patient to never take the second dose of the vaccine. Patient reports taking an antibody test (after a single dose of the vaccine) for both natural and for the spike protein on 25MAR2021. Patient reports that he had gotten a 9.64 reading from just one round of the vaccine in comparison to the doctors he had worked who had received both doses of the vaccine, never gotten sick with COVID-19, and produced a 9.0 reading. Patient reports his natural antibodies after 2 months was at 220.

There were not many until about two weeks later when I noticed on that same arm there was a rash that seemed consistent with poison ivy. One week later that same prickly, itchy rash was on both arms and my stomach. By Monday April 5th I had it all over and wasn't sure if I needed to get the second shot the following day. My regular doctor was out so the nurse asked one of his colleagues who had me get Hydrocortisone cream and take a zytec twice a day immediately and to still get the 2nd vaccine. I caked myself in the cream and reapplied it multiple times a day and took the medicine and I was in terrible pain and  and the rash continued to get worse. It burned and was now all over my legs, my back, stomach, breast, all over my arms and by bottom. I tried using calamine lotion and took soothing oatmeal baths. Both of those items helped but only for a short time. By that Friday the 8th I knew I needed a steroid shot because I have had to get two of those in my lifetime when I broke out with a terrible case of poison ivy. Again, my doctors office could not see me so I was instructed to go to their sister hospital that offered an Urgent Care. I was seen by the doctor on duty and she took one look at me and said I need a steroid shot that would be combined to give me instant relieve as well as long term. By that evening I wasn't in as much discomfort but I could see and still do to this day that the rash is still on my body - it's faded but every so often a new one rises.

It was so severe I contacted my doctor and by October 6, 2020 went to Hospital and received a cortisone shot hoping for relief from the pain.  The pain initially subsided in the left hip to  a less painful degree but by October 15th I was suffering with debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue coupled with joint pain  throughout my entire body but mostly concentrated in my lower back and legs.  I had difficulty getting up and down from a seated position, stooping or bending, walking up stairs or even small inclines..  I am in constant pain  which has negatively impacted my ability to comfortably perform simple day to day task and it has impacted my ability to have a good nights sleep as I wake up with pain in my lower back.

I could only keep a few sentences in my head at a time and my attention span was poor as well, like having significant ADHD, which I don't have. I was unable to retain simple amounts of information the day of the stroke. I didn't seek treatment on the day of the stroke since I felt it was more of the side effects I had been experiencing from Flecainide. After going to the hospital I felt good and much improved, cognitively. An ER neurologist said that my stroke was a 2 on a scale of 1 to 42. Over the remainder of March and until this day (April 16, 2021), I have made steady and rapid improvement. I attribute my recovery to the lower level of stroke damage and the fact that I worked out every day with physical exercise and I worked out cognitively by doing a series of activities that I chose myself: reading out loud, reciting poetry and tongue twisters, playing logic and puzzle games on the PC, returning to my writing tasks for work, practicing grammar, and speaking at length with family and friends as a way to practice speaking. I had one appointment with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a speech therapist and have completed assessment. I now feel I am nearly completely recovered with an odd sense of some improvement in certain areas such as heightened mood and quicker connections for noticing practical matters.",,,Y,,Y,,,,Y,02/22/2021,03/03/2021,9,"ER admission, physical exam, MRI, CT scan, EKG's, and elecrocardiogram.",PVT,,Metroprolol and Flecainide,None,Lone atrial fibrillation,,,2,04/16/2021,,,,None
