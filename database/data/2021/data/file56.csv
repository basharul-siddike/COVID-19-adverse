However, during our conversation on 4/18, she expressed concern that she had not known how to retract the needle during her first vaccination and had capped the needle.

Took the 9pm Coreg at 8pm; didn't feel improvement, my BP increased to 220/118. I took a Labetalol 100mg; in about 2-3 hrs my PB came down to 170/105 and I fell asleep.

I felt as if my heart was giving up. The only reason I did not go to Emergency was the fear I can get the COVID in the hospital.

I found it unacceptable that the only site reporting the spikes in BP as a COVID vaccine side effect was a hospital in another country; if there were such side effects reported by the date of my vaccine, they were not readily available for the public.   These heart problems could have been made much better if people like me knew of an increase in BP as adverse reaction to the vaccine's 2nd dose, so we could have been prepared, i.e. take the BP medication BEFORE the BP spikes up so much, so it doesn't reach critical values (especially in the conditions of malaise and general sickness given by the vaccine.)",,,Y,,,,,,U,04/14/2021,04/14/2021,0,,OTH,,Coreg CR 40mg/day; Atorvastatin 40mg/day,none,Well controlled blood pressure (same treatment w Coreg 40mg/day for almost 5 years),,,2,04/23/2021,,,,none

Now, I think I had a vulnerable area on my L side, then rec'd steroids L side, which lowered my immune system.

Second shot at 19 weeks. Mild fever for four days. Also no big deal. But I just had my 20 week us yesterday and am now measuring about three weeks behind. Had to follow up with maternal/fetal at the hospital for more analysis, and they confirmed I am measuring below 5th percentile for 20 weeks. Anatomically, everything looks okay, no defects, and they cannot find a source for the stunted growth, so this is good news. But I?m just to ?wait and see? for three weeks now how my growth trajectory looks. Given the ironic timeline of the growth delay with the timing of the vaccines I asked the doc today whether it?s pure coincidence or possibly related, and she assured me there?s no reason to believe it?s related, but she can understand my concern given the timeline.

I also had some weakness in my left arm where the shot was given. The tightness in my chest was not affecting my ability to breath, I was able to go on my usual daily hour-long walk but it was concerning me enough for a call with a Dr. I had spent the day before (Monday) using a wood pellet BBQ so I though maybe the issue was related to smoke. The Dr prescribed a salbutamol inhaler which I have used before for seasonal allergies but that didn't really d anything to help with the tight feeling. The feeling of tightness remained all week (and still does to some extent 11 days later).  On the Friday I noticed a small dark spot, approx 2mm,  a bit like a blood blister on the back of my right thigh. I have had these before fairly infrequently, and I see a dermatologist once a year for a check up and they are not concerned, and they usually go away on their own. But, the combination of a new blood spot and the continued tight feeling across my chest had me concerned enough to call my regular Dr's office.  I was also feeling occasional sporadic aches in my legs in varying places. I spoke to a practice nurse who was very reassuring that she had spoken to many other patients that had also been experiencing chest tightness that had gone on for days after the Janssen vaccine, so after that I felt less concerned about the symptoms. I am still experiencing the tightness in my chest which has affected my shoulders and neck with what feels like muscle tension, and also been accompanied by some mild headaches at the sides of my head.

At that time, I was dealing more with my ulcerative colitis. However, I have noticed that my headaches/migraines have been more severe and debilitating in March through current. I do not know if this is my ""normal"" or if it is in response to the second Covid 19 vaccination I received. I was speaking w/ my supervisor, and we realized I have missed a lot of time from work due to headaches/ migraines in March/April then I had in the preceding months.

1247470,04/23/2021,AZ,55.0,55,,F,,"4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt's BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine ""news"" came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don't work, I don't get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.

From H&P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation.

February 9, 2021  11 AM she received Moderna vaccine. by 7 PM she had a severe headache, leg numbness, severe arthralgias in her knees, global paresthesias, pressure behind her eyes, she describes her head is very heavy and pressurized was very painful.   Symptoms lasted for three days and gradually remitted. To a lesser degree  the headache persisted longer but resolved  March 10, 2021  received Moderna vaccine. On same day she developed headache, chest pain, back pain, leg numbness. She states that when she walked it exacerbated chest pain and headache and she had to walk very gently on her toes. She tried Tylenol, ibuprofen without effect. The symptoms persisted. She started taking two aspirin a day.  March 14 she worked third shift as usual (despite symptoms)  March 15, the symptoms were bad enough that she felt she had to go to the emergency room.  March 15, 2021 18:56      CT Head or Brain C-:    7 mm rounded hyperdensity within the pituitary gland which may represent a hyperdense pituitary mass lesion.    Associated hemorrhage is not excluded.   March 15, 2021 22:34   MRI Brain C-/C+:    There is 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm round structure in the anterior pituitary gland with high T1 signal, dark T2 signal, susceptibility artifact and no enhancement.    This likely represents a hemorrhage within the microadenoma.    Advise neurosurgical consult and follow-up MRI in 6 months. ________________  3/17/2021 I was consulted (while she was in hospital, chart review only. Patient not seen at that time)   I wrote...  PITUITARY ACTH Patient had ACTH stimulation test yesterday. Assuming she has received no steroid Rx during this admission prior to the ACTH stimulation test (as I have been told), then these results confirm that her adrenal gland has the ability to respond to ACTH and thus there is no reason to believe the underlying pituitary abnormality had resulted in chronic ACTH deficiency from the pituitary lesion that resulted in hemorrhage.  3/16/2021 4:32 PM   .Cort 30 min Stim   Cortisol 30 Minutes Post ACTH      19.3         mcg/dL   Cortisol 60 Min                    27.6         mcg/dL            As the pituitary hemorrhage was an acute event, it is possible the pituitary currently does not have the ability to make adequate amounts of ACTH, despite the normal ACTH stim test, but the situation is too acute to cause the adrenal to atrophy (as a result of chronic ACTH deficiency) and she still could have secondary adrenal insufficiency. When there is a chronic ACTH deficiency of sufficient duration, the adrenal gland will eventually atrophy and the patient will then develop primary adrenal insufficiency as well and then the ACTH stim test will become abnormal.  As we do not know if her pituitary can make ACTH appropriately, I think it would be prudent to treat the patient with PREDNISONE 2.5 mg qAM for now even thought we do not know for certain whether her pituitary can make ACTH. After discharge, she should be evaluated by endocrine to assess for ACTH deficiency. She should be advised to seek medical attention if she develops symptoms of adrenal insufficiency like nausea, emesis, abd pain, orthostatic symptoms.   PITUITARY TSH 3/15/2021 11:47 PM   T3 Total                      83         (normal: 60-181)  nGm/dL   T4, Total                     7.3        (normal: 4.5-13.3)  mcg/dL   TSH, 3rd gen                  2.160      (normal: 0.358-3.740)  mclU/ml  I think, based on above admission TFTs, she should also be treated with LEVOTHYROXINE 100 mcg qAM even though we do not know for certain if she has central hypothyroidism. This too should be reassessed in the future.   PITUITARY LH/FSH If she acutely or recently developed secondary amenorrhea and FSH is not c/w menopause, then that would suggest the lesion or hemorrhage has causes hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. This situation would increase the probability she has central adrenal insufficiency and central hypothyroidism. If menses remains normal henceforth, the it is more likely her ability to make TSH and ACTH are normal.  _______________   Patient was discharged on levothyroxine 100 �g in the morning and prednisone 2.5 mg daily. She's also on iron pills.  Past medical history: Iron deficiency anemia. Treatment was an IUD, after which she's gained a lot of weight.  Medicines: IUD, Levothyroxine 100 mcg QAM, prednisone 2.5 mg QAM, ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily  Allergies: none  No cigarette use, alcohol abuse or drug use  Family social history: patient has three children. High school educated. Healthcare worker.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: overall health is good. She feels well. No headache.  No nausea. No nocturia  Physical exam:  Extraocular muscles intact.  VF full Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam regular.  Impression: hemorrhage into pituitary gland  Temporarily, symptoms correlate with covid vaccination in a women who previously was (reportedly) dx with covid infection. Maybe the pituitary hemorrhage was the result of the coronavirus vaccination or the aspirin she was taking.   At this point she's feeling well. It's been about one month since the event. I'd like to wait another month and then proceed with testing of a pituitary gland to try to figure out if she really needs to remain on levothyroxine and prednisone and reimage the pituitary.  On the day of the testing she will take neither medicine in the morning. Will then measure LH, FSH, estradiol, TSH free T4 and cortisol and renal panel. Patient will then receive ACTH 0.25 mg IM and have cortisol measured at 30 minutes and 60 minutes. I will follow-up with her by phone.  She scheduled to see Dr. April 26. I would like to do another MRI but I would prefer to wait another month as she is clinically doing well and I want to allow the pituitary more time to ""heal""/stabilize.  No follow-up is scheduled with me, if Dr. does not order an MRI and I will after I received next blood test.

The injection in my left shoulder did not hurt too much, but slowly the injection site turned painful, hot with swelling up to 6? long and about 4? wide.  (As of 4/23/21, it is still swollen and hot.)  I took my 3 mg Prednisone, Tylenol and went to bed because I had a low grade fever and a headache.  Tuesday morning, April 20, 2021, the pain started about 5 a.m. I had chills, a headache, and fever.  I stayed in bed; and I took Tylenol as directed, and as the day continued, I needed help to the toilet.  I tried to drink a lot of fluids and ate about 4 pieces of canned peaches.  I continued to get worse and my temperature rose to 103 degrees.  (My normal temperature is 97.4.)  At one point, I felt nauseous, and had dry heaves.    In hindsight, the first true indication there was anything really wrong was I could not get back in bed.  I also had very little balance and almost fell.  That may have been 10 or 11 p.m.  When I went to bed, I was out cold.  I think I was almost comatose and slept through wetting the bed.  Tuesday is a blur.  Wednesday, April 21, 2021 was a bad day.  I woke up at 5 am needing to use the toilet.  I got out of bed and collapsed and hit my had on the nightstand.  At that point, I could not move my legs to get up.  They were buckled under me, and my husband could not get me up, so he called 911.  I was taken by ambulance to hospital.  In the ER, my neurological issues were apparent.  I was able to give some information, though, much would not come to my mind.  I remembered I have Polymyalgia Rheumatica but did not remember for several hours that I had a maintenance chemo treatment for bladder cancer later this week, for which there is no evidence of disease. When asked to move an arm for any reason, I could not move them; the staff did.  When they let go, my arms just fell with gravity.  Sitting up without help was impossible. I said the only medicine I had taken was Tylenol and was very surprised to see I had actually taken my Prednisone the night before.  I was given 800 mg of Motrin, but I do not know how often.  I had some chills, fever and pain throughout my body most of the day.  I slept most of the time in the ER.  When I was brought lunch, I ate a few small squares of pears using a fork.  It was hard, I could not find my mouth with the fork.  The doctor said all of my many tests and vital signs were good.  When she asked me to lift my legs, I could not.  Thus, I was transferred to a bed in the hospital.  The only thing I ate there was a small bowl of applesauce again with difficulty.  I slept most of the time again.  My legs started to gain strength about 4 p.m., and I was released at 6:30 p.m.  I could have stayed the evening, but I wanted to go home.  Thursday, April 22, 2021 was a better day.  I started taking Bayer Back and Body Aspirin for my pain.  I was in less pain and more alert so I could isolate what hurt.  My left arm was still red, very hot and painful.  My right upper arm hurt too.  My headache was the worst, it even makes my ears hurt.  I got dressed and went outside for a half an hour.  I came in and put my pjs back on and went to bed.  I was still unsteady walking around. I had absolutely no energy and am unsteady while walking.   Friday, April 23, 2021.  I woke up hungry at six.  Ate two scrambled eggs, took a very fast shower because I could not stand very long, and went back to bed and slept for 5 hours.  I am still unsteady on my feet and only have a minor headache.

She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from ""head to toe"" although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.

The patient presented with asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and a history of episodic fatigue and sinusitis for several years. Episodic fatigue occurred every 2-3 weeks and was described as not feeling rested even after 12 h of sleep. Chronic sinusitis was treated with 4-5 prolonged antibiotic courses per year. Nasal cultures grew methicillinsensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus irifluenzae. Three separate sinus surgeries over the prior few years moderately reduced her sinus symptoms. Other relevant history was significant for recurrent urinary tract infections with E. coli and Klebsiella, recurrent otitis media as a child, and a diagnosis of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy that resolved at 4 years of age.  Review of systems revealed intermittent axillary lymphadenopathy, longstanding eczema that responded to topical tacrolimus, multiple environmental allergies, and recently diagnosed asthma that improved with inhaled budesonide (+) formoterol. As a teenager, she received allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for a few years but stopped due to frequent adverse reactions. Family history revealed that her mother received AIT for seasonal allergies, and her father died from infection associated with chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Physical exam at the initial evaluation was only remarkable for nasal turbinate hypertrophy.  Laboratory evaluation demonstrated normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) 886 mg/dL, immunoglobulin M (IgM) 139 mg/dL, immunoglobulin A (IgA) 156 mg/dL, elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) 373 kU/L, normal T and natural killer (NK) cell enumeration, slightly decreased total B cells (180 cells/microliter, 5.6% of lymphocytes), and normal B cell subsets (CD19+CD27-IgM+ 67%, CD19+ CD27+IgM+17%, CD19+IgM-CD27+ 13%). Tetanus antibody titer was protective (0.27 IU/mL), but haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) antibody titer was undetectable at less than 0.15 IU/mL and not protective after vaccination (0.53 IU/mL). Pneumococcal serotype-specific lgG levels were undetectable to 20 of 23 serotypes tested at baseline, and only 4 were considered protective post-vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) (antibody test negative). QuantiFERON gold assays consistently showed interferon (IFN)-gamma release more than 10.00 IU/mL in response to ""PHA"" (positive control), demonstrating T cell responsiveness to this mitogen. Due to poor antibody response and continued sinus infections, she was started on IgG replacement for the diagnosis of specific antibody deficiency. Her fatigue and sinus symptoms improved moderately, but she continued to require antibiotics. Sinus computed tomography (CT) scans continued to demonstrate significant disease. An in-house focused exome panel showed only a novel heterozygous caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11) variant (c.215G more than T, p.R72L). Specific antibody deficiency as observed in the patient was commonly seen in CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) signaling (CADINS). The outcome of the event antibody test negative was unknown.  The causality between the event and pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (PNEUMOVAX23) was assessed as related.

The reporter states that if someone experiences those kind of experiences, they should kindly call the hotline and seek help. The patient just wanted the vaccine to be beneficial to her.At this point she really does not know what was to be done, she did not want to be afraid of the Covid 19 vaccine as she knew that the benefits were greater than the risk. She was also apprehensive with the first Covid 19 vaccine.  The patient want to take her second shingles vaccine after the second Covid vaccine. The patient was taking the ibuprofen for a little bit but then the pain came back.  The patient would be getting the second Covid-19 vaccine on 16th March 2021. Later in the call, she clarified that the virus she was speaking of was the herpes zoster virus or also known as shingles. The patient was going to change her doctors as she did not like the little care they had for someone experiencing something like those events.  The patient thought if this was related to her Covid-19 vaccine so she started reading more about what the vaccine could do to the patient and it had a side effect and it said in there and she misread during her paperwork and it was considered severe if she had swelling on her face and throat and she ignored her paperwork.She read that and decided to call. That was what she experienced with her lymph nodes, and from her neck and shoulder and the pain such that she couldn't turn her head to the left, and she thought maybe it was a pinched nerve and she always thought something else was bothering her.  She was taking Valtrex for the virus that caused bells palsy and that made it better(shingles/herpes zoster).  She started healing with that medicine and she knew it wasn't a pinched nerve and that it was the shingles/herpes zoster that attacked her. She was better on the reporting date but still had pain behind her ear.  She knew a doctor that had the same situation with this virus (shingles or herpes zoster) and she went blind.When the doctor did her eyes and got the Lasix surgery, she had the virus attack her and she called it the herpes virus, the secondary or whatever they call it. It was related to chicken pox and she got the virus when she was a kid, then it laid dormant and 10 to 15 years before the time of reporting, when that doctor went blind, if the doctor had known she would have taken the Valtrex prior to her Lasix surgery.She had been to the emergency room with her meningitis and the doctor explained it to her. The patient clarified again that she never had the shingles rash breakout on her skin, but had the nerve part of it., she had symptoms for 3 weeks and they wanted to send her for neurology and MRI and she told them to give her the Valtrex and she took it for 7 days and her symptoms disappeared completely.  Only reason she thought it was the herpes zoster virus was because she got the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm and it was the same area and the same thing only but this time it wouldn't go away completely, but it was her arm which felt like someone had hit her with a bat.  She had very bad muscle pain when she lifts her arm. The reporter confirmed Covid-19 vaccine date as 23rd February 2021 (first dose). The patient was treated with Valtrex (Valacyclovir Hcl 1gm tablet 1 per day usually at night in a pharmacy bottle) which should be discarded by 5th November 2021. The patient also took Advil Duo Action which had 250mg acetaminophen and 125mg ibuprofen  (2 caplets in the morning and one caplet at night) with lot number DN7584 and expiration date of August,2022.
