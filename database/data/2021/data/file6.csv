The patient was asking if it was safe to take anything or could she take dimenhydrinate. It's been 8 hours since the patient had the vaccine and she only wanted to know if she can take dimenhydrinate because she was having dizziness around 7:30 PM. The patient was tired and did not want to hold, so warm call transfer was not attempted. The patient was about to call her pharmacist as soon as she was referred back to her healthcare professional and disconnected before she was offered the survey. Further that day, the patient reported that she was fine - meaning she had no reaction except felt dizzy around 7:30 or so (around 8 hours after administration). The patient looked at one of the complications and it could be dizziness and weakness, but she just felt a little dizzy and she gets like that sometime. That day (10Jan2021), the patient checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and they were both fine. The patient was just wondering if she could take the half of dimenhydrinate (reason of call). On paraphrasing the concern, the patient reported that she gets dizzy (vertigo-like dizziness) sometimes and she never takes a whole dimenhydrinate; she takes half of one and for this instance, the patient thought she would take half but she wanted to talk to Pfizer medical information first. In response to further questions, the patient stated that 8-10 minutes, she was not feeling good - patient can't do that (answering questions) and just needed some help.

I did NOT feel short of breath. I tried to calm down by doing slow concentrated breathing. I continued to take small sips of water to gauge my swallowing ability.

It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system.

My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt ""less frozen"" and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen + 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30.

She was unavailable.   Things seemed to get worse for the next 30 or so hours. At some point I started alternating ibuprofen and tylonel in an attempt to get more relief as I was worried I was taking too much tylonel (as per the label). Was in bed only getting up for water/br. After that, the symptoms seemed to start to get better but the chest pain remained constant. I also noticed mild to moderate joint pain when the other symptoms decreased enough that I actually got out of bed.  Call back from doctor's nurse about 48 hours after shot (Wednesday afternoon): she was concerned why I didn't go to ER for chest pain, and recommended I at least go to urgent care just to make sure.  Went to ER at about 5PM (Wednesday) EKG good, chest x-ray clear, covid test negative, blood work good (no cardiac event evidence, slightly low white blood cells, d-dimer elevated possible to vaccination response itself?), lungs clear- CT with contrast.  The doctor was not sure what it was other than an unexplained side effect of the vaccination... until we did the CT (which was done last) and she seemed somewhat surprised to find swollen lymph nodes all in the left pectoral area. She believes this is a reaction to the vaccination. Both my doctor's office and the ER doctor didn't know of other people noting chest pain like I had after the vaccination. We were both happy and relieved to have an answer. Should go away on its own within a few weeks. Recommended to follow up with primary care in a few weeks to make sure the swelling goes away.  So, I experienced all of the possible side effects listed. What is not listed is chest pain and the (likely associated) sharp pain when breathing in deeply. That was my reason for calling the doctor. The other side effects I was at least prepared for. When the chest pain did not decrease like the rest of the side effects I figured it was better to be safe than sorry.  Wednesday night I slept much better and only recorded a slightly elevated temperature when tylonel wearing off (99.7). Still have that left side chest pain but feel much better knowing what it is.

She went back again yesterday (07Jan2021). She had another Rapid COVID test and also a flu swab and both tests came back negative. She mentions they also did another COVID test (the send out type) and she should get that back around 1pm to find out the results of that.  They also did a CBC (07Jan2021) and everything was normal.

The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.",,,Y,,,,,,U,01/14/2021,01/14/2021,0,,WRK,,Metoprolol ER succinate 50mg,,hypertension,,,2,01/15/2021,,Y,,"shellfish, fish, seafood, lisinopril"

She did not offer additional details and explained that she had tolerated other shots (including the 2020 flu shot) without incident. I advised patient to remain for a 30 minute monitoring period post-vaccination due to history of allergic reaction. Patient presented with some anxiety before the shot and immediately started to complain of feeling ""sick"" and said she was having trouble breathing due to chest pressure. We advised patient to remove her mask and provided her with water and a trash can though no vomiting occurred. After 15-20 minutes, patient still complained of chest pressure and difficulty breathing. When asked if she was experiencing any itchiness or throat swelling, patient said she did feel some throat swelling so she was given 25MG of Benadryl. After an additional 15 minutes, patient's condition seemed unchanged (not worsening, not improving) so the facility's nursing team was called to evaluate patient. Patient said she was still experiencing difficulty breathing and throat swelling so nursing advised use of EPI-PEN and patient consented. I administered a dose of 0.3MG (LOT0FM4066/EXP 02/2022) to the right lateral thigh and nurse called for EMS. Immediately after injection, patient's eyes fluttered and she seemed to be on the verge of fainting. Nursing checked her oxygen saturation which was 100%. Patient reported no improvement after 5 minutes so another EPI-PEN 0.3MG was administered to the left lateral thigh. Nursing also gave the patient 81MG chewable aspirin due to the patient experiencing a stroke last month. EMS arrived a few minutes after the second EPI-PEN dose and patient was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Facility reported that patient went home that afternoon but did not provide details.

Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I'd done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I'm always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn't warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can't seem to will myself to leave bed. I'm pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven't had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can't find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%+ every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I've had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I'm worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I'm too sleepy.",,,,,,,,,Y,01/12/2021,01/12/2021,0,,PVT,,"Mary Ruth's K2+D3 Calcium Gummies Vitafusion Women's Organic Multi Gummies Nature's Bounty Hair, Skin, and Nails Gummies Mary Ruth's Omega 3-6-7-9 Gummies Mary Ruth's Vitamin D3 Gummies Mary Ruth's Eye Care Gummies",,HLA-B27 gene (caused anterior uveitis 2016 and 2018).,,,2,01/15/2021,,,Y,"Meloxicam, pineapples, kiwis, kiwiberries, certain lactose products (milk, cream)."

0950341,01/16/2021,MT,27.0,27,,F,,"12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn't cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn't much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn't in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn't seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.",,,,,,,,,N,12/29/2020,01/04/2021,6,01/13/2021 - Xray and pinched nerve shoulder tests,PVT,,IUD- Skyla,None,None,,,2,01/16/2021,,Y,Y,Augmentin

Sx are most prominent when driving or in bed preparing to sleep. He consulted his PCP, who is an NP. She checked HbA1c and found it normal. She prescribed gabapentin 100mg daily prn, which patient has not used. There were no reports of peripheral neuropathy in the FDA documents for the Pfizer vaccine. Intermittent symptoms are unusual for peripheral neuropathy. Hyperventilation can cause intermittent numbness and tingling of fingers and toes.At this time I would characterize his symptoms as unexplained. Although it is unlikely, I cannot rule out a relationship to the vaccine. Due to concern that the symptoms could be an early symptom of a neurologic condition that has not yet fully manifested, I advised him to cancel his appt for the second dose, and wait to see how if his symptoms progress. If his symptoms resolve, he could schedule the second dose of vaccine at a later date. While the 21 day interval is ideal, CDC has advised that there is no outer limit to when the second dose may be administered.""",,,,,,,,,N,12/21/2020,01/01/2021,11,,OTH,,,,,,,2,01/14/2021,,,,

I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in.
