REASSESSMENT   6:35 PM Patient presents to the ED and was seen at bedside. I discussed the patient's case with him and informed him of his atrial fibrillation.   7:43 PM I discussed the patient's case and the above findings with Dr. (Cardiology) about the patient's condition.   7:54 PM  I reevaluated the patient at bedside. The patient informs me they feel improved following Eliquis and IV fluid administration. I discussed the patient's diagnostic study results. I discussed plan for discharge and follow up as outlined below. The patient verbalizes they feel comfortable going home. The patient is stable for discharge at this time and will return for any new or worsening symptoms. Patient verbalizes understanding and support with my plan for discharge.    HYDRATION: Based on the patient's presentation of Tachycardia the patient was given IV fluids. IV Hydration was used because oral hydration was not adequate alone and patient presents with dizziness. Upon recheck following hydration, the patient was improved.     COURSE & MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Nursing notes, VS, PMSFHx reviewed in chart.   Patient a male who comes in for evaluation of dizziness.  Differential diagnosis includes dehydration, vaccination side effect, arrhythmia, electrolyte disturbance, acute coronary syndrome.  Diagnostic work-up includes labs and EKG.   Patient's initial vitals are within normal limits.  He is treated with IV fluids for his dizziness and decreased oral intake over the last day secondary to his vaccine.  EKG returns and demonstrates new onset atrial fibrillation which is already rate controlled likely as patient is on metoprolol for his cardiomyopathy.  EKG is nonischemic.  Patient's labs returned and are unremarkable.  Electrolytes are within normal limits.  Troponin is within normal limits and EKG is nonischemic making acute coronary syndrome unlikely.  Patient has a HEART score of 3 making him low risk for acute coronary syndrome.  I discussed the case with cardiologist Dr. who agrees that since patient is doing well he can be discharged home to follow-up in clinic.  She does recommend initiating apixaban therapy for his atrial fibrillation as his CHA2DS2-VASc score is 2.  I discussed this with patient and discussed risks and benefits of apixaban.  I discussed his stroke risk with him.  After discussion patient is amenable to initiating apixaban therapy.  I did discuss avoiding sports in which he could have traumatic brain injury as he is high risk for bleeding when initiating anticoagulation.  Patient understands and is amenable to this plan.  He is started on apixaban and will follow up in clinic with his cardiologist Dr. He has been given strict return precautions and discharged in stable condition.    The patient will return for new or worsening symptoms and is stable at the time of discharge.   The patient is referred to a primary physician for blood pressure management, diabetic screening, and for all other preventative health concerns.   DISPOSITION: Patient will be discharged home in stable condition.   FOLLOW UP: M.D.             OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:    New Prescriptions     APIXABAN (ELIQUIS) 5MG TAB      Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times a day.       FINAL IMPRESSION 1.

Consults Physician at 4/4/2021  7:39 PM I was called to discuss this patients care with. We discussed atrial fibrillation management.   Briefly, this old man with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and dyslipiemia who came in with flulike symptoms and dizziness.  The patient had his second shot of Covid vaccine on 4/2/2021.  The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation on EKG here (new onset).  The patient's heart rate has been 60s-70s mostly while in the ER.  Labs have been unremarkable, and the patient's symptoms have since resolved as per the ER physician.  Given CHA2DS2-VASc of at least 2, I would recommend starting some anticoagulation.  Continue home metoprolol, which seems to be controlling the patient's HR.  If the patient remains in A. fib, can consider TEE/DCCV or DCCV after 3 weeks of uninterrupted anticoagulation.   At this time it was deemed no formal in person cardiology consultation was necessary, however if this changes due to changes in patient condition or abnormal test results, please re-consult cardiology.

I started sweating.  I stood up from the table to take the cup to the sink and my vision turned partially black.  I thought I had stood up too quickly, so I sat down again.  I walked back to the table and sat down. I felt I was loosing control of my body.  I stood up again with the intention of going back to bed, and started walking towards my bedroom.  I told my husband that I was seeing all black.  I don't recall what happened next.  My husband says that he was asking me if I was alright but didn't answer.

March 30, upon waking: Chills and aches were gone, but by 10 AM, my teeth continued to get more and more sensitive (it felt like I had been hit on the right side of my mouth) and my gum tissue became bulbous and sore around the sore teeth (6,7,8,25,26,27) and I wondered if I cracked a tooth somehow. However, the pain radiated to the right posterior teeth, and crossed to both incisors (top and bottom) on the left side. I would describe the pain as throbbing and acutely sensitive to room temperature air, pressure, hot and cold. this happened in a very short span of time, and I was awake and not clenching or grinding my teeth. March 30, afternoon: I called my dentist. He was out of town. I posted on social media, asking if anyone has had tooth pain post vaccine. There were a handful of anecdotal stories (first hand) with a similar issue, so I decided to wait and see if my issue would resolve similarly. April 6: Pain has been intermittently severe and dull over the past week. I see my dentist this afternoon to do an evaluation. He says the tissue looks odd - almost like a herpetic lesion trying to heal, both around tooth 26 and on the palate adjacent to 8. Also, it appears there is no longer any keratinized gum tissue around 26, and the tissue had receded dramatically on this tooth. The doctor takes photos and refers me to a periodontist for a tissue graft to save the tooth. April 9 (today): I have an appointment with a periodontist next week for an evaluation. My dentist assures me the area will need a graft. Today I have less pain, but the gingival inflammation around 26 has persisted. Since I don't know the outcome at this point, I can only hope that tooth 26 can be saved with a facial graft, but that is the course of action.",,,,,,,,Y,N,03/29/2021,03/29/2021,0,"Periodontal probing, photographs and evaluation of the affected teeth.",OTH,,Ibuprophen,Headache,"Migraine headaches, former periodontal disease with no existing inflammation, pocketing or perio activity in the last three years.

These body aches felt wildly different from those from the first immediate reaction.  From there, I got a COVID test, Flu, and strep test taken all of which came back negative. The pain continued to worsen unbearably so I went to the ER. There, they tried a few pain medicines to ease the pain. It was the most uncomfortable time I've ever spent in my body. The doctor said the vaccine essentially attacked my nervous system and I had no idea what was happening to me because it isn't being mentioned as a possible side effect. However, both doctors I visited said they have been seeing neurological adverse effects in the hospital following the vaccine rollout. The pain lasted for a full week, and as of this past Saturday I've been feeling much better.

After the 15 minutes, I walked out to my car and thankfully my husband had driven because what happened next would have caused an accident.  Our drive home is approximately 20 minutes from where vaccine was administered.  In the car I began to feel a tingling all over my body that gradually began to feel like ?pins and needles? (like when you sit on your legs for too long and they ?fall asleep?), with the worst of the feeling being in both of my hands. I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.  By the time we pulled into the driveway, my hand had locked up in a weird position and I was no longer able to communicate with them and make them move.  They were temporarily paralyzed.  My husband opened the door for me because I wasn?t capable of doing so.  Once I stepped out of the car, my body began to convulse and shake.  We stood there for a few minutes because one, I couldn?t make my body cooperate and two, we didn?t want our children seeing me that way.  My husband kept asking me if he should call an ambulance.  Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.  I was feeling waves of cold down my body. Like a skin prickling when you hear a beautiful song and you get goosebumps and your hairs stand up.  I woke around 3am to an extreme headache and a fever of 102.6.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I woke in the morning, I felt better but had weird and random muscle twitching.  For the past few days I?ve been suffering with extreme fatigue which is not like me at all.  Even when I?m tired, I can still manage to function throughout the day.

1188045,04/09/2021,CA,60.0,60,,M,,"Subacute thyroiditis This generally healthy patient, with no history of thyroid disease, developed subacute thyroiditis (SAT) following an influenza vaccination.  He experienced no viral infection symptoms in the weeks preceding the vaccination, nor during the weeks after the vaccination when the SAT symptoms developed.  He spent approximately 3 months in phase 1 (thyrotoxic), followed by a 1 month transition to hypo-thyroid, followed by a 1 year gradual transition to normal thyroid function.  The patient sought medical care for his thyrotoxic symptoms several times before they were correctly diagnosed almost 3 months post vaccination. In the several days following the vaccination, mild soreness at the upper left arm injection site spread up over the shoulder and into the left side of the neck, where it gradually worsened over the next 2 weeks.  12 days post vaccination, the patient visited his Primary Care Physician (PCP) for this pain, which was most prominent in the left neck, but also present on the left side of the head and the anterior and posterior neck.  The patient also noted some throat discomfort with swallowing.  Examination revealed possible thyroid swelling, but no indications of respiratory infection.  Over the next 2.5 months, his neck pain persisted, with increasing anterior neck pain, sometimes radiating to the jaw and ears.  Discomfort with swallowing increased, and headaches were no longer confined to the left side of the head.  The patient also felt progressively unwell, with difficulty sleeping, body aches, and increasingly frequent chills.  (Though he did not measure his temperature.)  87 days post vaccination, the patient again sought care from his PCP.  He had started measuring his temperature in recent days and found it varying from 96 to 102 degrees F.  At this point, his thyroid was more clearly painful when palpated, so additional lab tests were ordered on 2020 March 2.  High sed rate (93 mm/hr), high Free T4 (2.10 ng/dL), and very low Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH, < 0.005 uIU/mL) indicated subacute thyroiditis (SAT) in the thyrotoxic phase, and the patient was referred to endocrinologist.  Additional tests over the next 3 weeks confirmed the SAT diagnosis.  These included Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (< 1.0), Free T3 (7.40 pg/mL), a thyroid ultrasound (enlarged with increased vascularity), and thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (0.9% at 6 hours, and 0.8% at 24 hours).  At 124 days post-vaccination (2020 April 8), the patient's thyrotoxic symptoms had largely resolved, consistent with the hypo-thyroid c ondition indicated by lab tests:  TSH = 19.600 uIU/mL, Free T4 = 0.67 ng/dL, and Free T3 = 2.50 pg/mL.

While I was talking to the patient, patient states the lips and face are having symptoms of tingling and with sensation of swelling. Patient also states feeling dizzy, sleepy, nausea, and lethargic.

Patient has sign of becoming less arousable. Patient states vision becoming more blurred and patient was near passing out.  Due to above progressing and escalating symptoms, possible anaphylactic reaction to COVID 19 vaccine is considered. I immediately call for assistance from nursing staff to bring EpiPen.  Dr.arrived with EpiPen in the exam room.  Patient continues to have progressing symptom of difficulty with arousal in a near syncopal state.  Patient is becoming less alert.  Decision is to give EpiPen injection to reverse potential progressive and impending anaphylactic reaction with sign of progressive hypotension.

Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit.

Zyrtec seemed to slow the progression of tongue swelling slightly but at 10pm, I started having a dry cough and wheezing. I took Albuterol and Benadryl and that worked to stop the tongue swelling. Please note, the reason I don?t use Epi immediately is because I have Reynaud?s and it is contraindicated. So I use other rescue meds first if I can.

I told her to have a seat and went to check on her. She stated that she was having pain down her arm where she was given the vaccine and down her left side. Then she stated she was itching. I could see her starting to turn red with hives/rash on her left arm where we administered the vaccine. stayed with the patient in front of the pharmacy while I ran into the pharmacy and got the blood pressure machine, Benadryl, EpiPen, adverse reaction chart, and cold pack. I asked to grab pen and paper and take notes as we ran back out. Her itching was becoming more severe, and she stated she was feeling lightheaded. We immediately began checking her blood pressure (which was extremely high at 187/120) and administered 50 mg of Benadryl. We applied a cold pack to her neck as it appeared she was sweating and then applied a cold pack to the injection site. She continued to progress with the itching moving to other sites on her body. I asked one of the technicians to get the other pharmacist to call 911 and a code white was called.  She was in a chair without arms, and I needed to have her lay down. I also had five more people waiting for vaccine administration, so we moved her to the break room. We continued to monitor her blood pressure, which was dropping, and watch for signs of anaphylaxis. She stated she was feeling really tired and began closing her eyes. We continued to have her talk with us and not go to sleep. We had EpiPen's ready for administration if needed. The EMS arrived as we were checking her BP once again and they took over. She was placed on a stretcher and taken into the ambulance.

Medical history included ongoing AFib (Diagnosed 7-10 years ago), sulfa allergy, ongoing to keep bowels soft and pliable, down from 210 lbs (he found out his wife had breast cancer, he lost the weight, prior receiving vaccine), bad ankles (uses a cane and walker and noticed he was having). Concomitant medications included warfarin at 5 mg daily (Started taking 7-10 years) for AFib; diltiazem hydrochloride at 180 mg daily (Started taking 2 years ago) for AFib and omeprazole at 20 mg daily (Taking for 7-10 years) to keep bowels soft and pliable and unspecified medication. They reported that he called Pfizer yesterday about the same question; however, today he would like to know if he can get a letter stating that it was permissible to get the vaccine 4 days short of the 21 days. Caller reports that he received first dose yesterday, and felt slightly dizzy afterwards and today he had pain in arm slightly Feb2021. Caller reports he had a sulfa allergy. Caller was scheduled for second dose on 27Feb2021. He received the first shot this morning. It went along nicely. He had two questions. He went back in to reschedule next appointment and the only thing they had available at (College name) was this month on 26Feb2021 or 27Feb2021, so he picked out the 25Feb2021, which he later stated was 26Feb2021. He had the shot this morning and it was only 15 days and he understands it was not supposed to be given until 21 days and wanted to know if that was true. His second question was after he had injection and he told them he was only allergic to Sulfa, they told him not to worry about it that there were so little problems with that. Before he got it, he had a sleepless night. He said he was old and he was worried about all kinds of things. He started talking to the guy the drove him over. He noticed he was a little dizzy and he probably could drive but should not. They dropped him off at his place and he was only one block away. When he got home, he drank some water and ate lunch and still feels a little bit out of it. He had a feeling if he got a good nights sleep, he would be fine. But, he wondered if it was related to the Sulfa allergy. He was down from 210 lbs. It just happened when he found out his wife had breast cancer that he lost the weight, which was prior to receiving the vaccine. She just passed away 6 weeks ago and had bone and breast cancer. He was bending and his back was starting to arch. He used to be 5' 11.5"". That was before the vaccine. This has been happening for years. He has bad ankles and uses a cane and walker and noticed he was having more trouble right after he got the vaccine. Now, he was not having any more problems than usual. His head was still just a little foggy on 2021. When getting up, he stated he did not fall. He had a very unrestful night on 2021 and it could be related to that. He heard second dose should be 21 days and not 15 days. He provided on his vaccine card. They were having an influx of cases in his area and his wife and he had planned to get the vaccine as soon as they offered it. He said the reason he takes Omeprazole was his insides, all through his hose system, every once in a while he had some problems, and it started to bleed, so this was something to keep it soft and pliable. He was allergic to Sulfa. He does not have the name of medication, manufacturer, lot or expiration.

The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021.

The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy.

The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past.

After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn't, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine.

The CDC has said that when giving the injection it is no longer necessary to aspirate (pull back on the syringe) which I was taught to do as a young nurse to ensure that you are not giving the injection into a vein (blood would appear in the syringe.) It is supposed to be given into the muscle which has plenty of veins so if you don't aspirate, how will you know if you are injecting into a vein? A week later, I ended up going to the local hospital ER because of the SOB and had Chest xray, EKG, brain Cat Scan and blood work which were all normal. I debated about getting the second shot but decided to get it as long as the injector gave the injection as I had been taught. Fortunately she was very experienced and agreed to inject me using the pullback method after I explained what I had gone through the 1st time. So for the second shot I had the sore arm but no other reaction. I think Dr is making a mistake about the pullback decision.  Do we even know what happens if the vaccine is injected into a vein?

When I saw him, he ordered a CT scan and put me on a strong antibiotic thinking that it was an infection, not related to the vaccine. Meanwhile I had a CT scan and blood workup. The CT scan came back with significant swelling and inflammation in my small intestines. Five miserable days later my GI took me off of the antibiotic and was now talking about putting my on a strong steroid. (Budesonide) Then, due to tremendous cramping I went to the ER where they did another CT Scan, blood workup as well. They did see less swelling and that gave us hope that the steroid was working. Finally, I got a endoscopy where they took six biopsies. We are still waiting on the biopsies but they doctor said the inflammation was going done but that my stomach lining was particularly red.
