Then, while I continued to be a little more tired than usual, But was able to strenuous yard work, row on my rowing machine for 45 minutes, take a 3.5 mile walk with my dog. Then about 12 days in I began to feel like I was coming down with the flu, running a little warm or easily chilled, fatigue, body aches and a persistent but fairly mild headache. I never got above 99 degrees on the thermometer and that was after taking a nap in the direct sunlight for a couple of hours on my bed. Mostly it was low, occasionally getting up to 98 but normal the rest of the time, from 96.7 to 98.6. My back hurt from the heavy yard work, and I had similar body aches that I had in the two days after Shot #2. I got a little sicker on day 2 and 3, but began to feel better on the 4th day and then feel almost 100% on the fifth day. I believe it is a substantial, if delayed response to the vaccine at about the date I would expect to achieve maximum immunity. I wasn't sure of this  when I wasn't feeling well. So about 3 and a half days of feeling sickish and then nearly fully recovered. I read that if your body has a strong immune response (which I believe this was) you might test positive for COVID if I took a test. Friends and family are urging me to get the test even though I feel pretty darn good today.

This exam was performed according to our departmental dose-optimization program, which includes automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to  patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique. IV CONTRAST:  80 mL of Omnipaque 300 Total DLP:           438.27 mGy-cm FINDINGS: The pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged measuring 3.8 cm in diameter.The opacification of the pulmonary arteries is adequate. There is no filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is a 3.6 cm right sided thyroid nodule resulting in subtle effacement of the trachea There is mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta There is no pericardial effusion. Mediastinum and hila are negative for lymphadenopathy or mass.  The esophagus is normal in course and caliber. There is a 1.6 x 1.1 x 2.5 cm nodule within the right upper lobe. There is extensive emphysematous changes of the lung with extensive bulla formation within the right upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax. There is a moderate right simple pleural effusion with subsegmental atelectasis. The central airway is moderately compromised due to motion artifact however there appears to be complete opacification of the right lower lobe bronchus. There are also calcifications within the left lower lobe bronchi. There is a small simple left pleural effusion with associated subsegmental atelectasis. There is moderate to severe osteopenia. There is no height loss of the vertebral bodies. IMPRESSION: Severe emphysematous changes of the lung with a suspicious 1.6 x 1.1 x 2.5 cm nodule in the right upper lobe which appears similar to previous examination and may represent scar however PET scan may be of further benefit to confirm this finding. There is a moderate right and mild right pleural effusion with filling defect within the right main bronchus and left lower lobe bronchi suspicious for aspiration, underlying mass is doubtful however bronchoscopy may be of further benefit. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

I went to the doctor and they suggested putting ice on it and taking Tylenol. It should go away in a few days. By Wednesday night, it was extremely red and growing. It is now Thursday night, the redness, swelling and pain are going down, especially in the middle. The outer areas are still very red. The pain comes and go. It is not as hot.

The patient's concurrent condition included inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis. The patient had no medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, glucose intolerance, systemic vasculitis, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, or obesity. The patient had no significant family history of neurological disorders. The patient's concomitant medication included sulfasalazine for ulcerative colitis.  On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand name not specified; route of administration, anatomical location, dose, indication: not reported). The batch number reported was not reported.  On the same day, immediately after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient experienced blurry vision.   On an unspecified date, five days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent vaccine, the patient presented to the hospital with a complaint of blurry vision. He denied smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using intravenous drugs and was sexually active with one female partner only. On a general physical exam, his blood pressure revealed 122/67. The ophthalmic exam revealed a dilated pupil in the right eye, mild ptosis, and diplopia with reduced adduction, elevation, and depression of the right eye but abduction and intorsion were fine. No abnormality was detected in other cranial nerve exams. Neurological and other system examinations revealed normal. On blood work, the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lipid panel, and haemoglobin a1c (HbA1c) revealed unremarkable. Imaging of the brain that included computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without intravenous (IV) contrast, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck with and without IV contrast revealed unremarkable. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. The patient was diagnosed with transient oculomotor nerve palsy and was treated conservatively with lubricating eye drops.  On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from the event since his symptoms resolved in two weeks.  The reporters assessed the event as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent vaccine. Most of the possible causes of oculomotor nerve palsy, such as stroke, intracranial space occupying lesions, aneurysms, and infections, were ruled out by history, physical exam, blood work, and imaging studies, thus leading to the influenza vaccine as the most likely cause. The fact that this happened immediately after an influenza vaccination made this a plausible cause, and the rapid improvement of the symptoms in patient supported the rationale of demyelination for the pathogenesis of transient nerve palsy.  The event of 'oculomotor nerve paralysis' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.   Company Comment: A 23-year-old male patient developed IIIrd nerve paralysis on the same day after vaccination with the suspect product influenza virus vaccine polyvalent.

Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the 'violence' of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke.

The patient came to him and when he would try to lift the eyelid up, it would just drop down. He then called a neuro ophthalmologist, he thought to himself that the patient could be having a stroke. The patient was sent to the Emergency Room and kept overnight to do CT of brain, MRI of brain, CT of orbits and MRI of neck. All tests came back normal, there was no stroke. The patient was discharged and was told to go see an ophthalmologist; the eye doctor diagnosed him with Cranial Nerve 3 Palsy. The reporter had read the consultation notes; the eye doctor ""wrote 1-2 days after he had COVID and had this happen"".

Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don't know what is the first one will do to her.

Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn't watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn't round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn't even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn't have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn't sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn't want to go hospital. She didn't think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn't want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that's considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn't take anything (clarification requested).

In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn't know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don't want laying on floor, don't want to have 105 temperature or anything.

I already reported on this site, on my 1/27/2021 reaction  Received through a pharmacy clinic set up at my work.  Lot#.   EL9263  Received dose #2 about 10:30am on Wednesday 2/17/2021 during my work hours. (7-4pm)  Paid closer attention to how I felt during the day, I could feel, I was going to be foggy in my head again. I was getting tried quickly. My left arm was not sore this time.  Got home about 4pm (left a little early). Very tired, went to bed by 5:30pm. Slept, woke up to heat soup and eat.   7pm: Back to sleep. Very exhausted, my eyes were hurting (a sign I have a fever) I did not care enough to take my temp. Seemed to hard to try and find the thermometer.   7:30pm: Back to bed. Sleep. I'm very warm in my bed, sweating under arms and chest, I don't care, I can sleep thru that. Smells funny  (sweat has a distinct oder)  11pm: wake up. I want to go pee, but I'm too cold to leave my warm covers. as soon as I uncover to get up, I have violent chills. I don't have chills if I stay covered. This was the exact same symtom I had on May 11, 2021 when I had the covid19 and came home sick from work. Violent chills, barely able to stand and walk alone.  After midnight: I wait for someone to come upstairs to help me get up, with a blanket ready to throw over me and help me to toilet. I was too weak to call for him or to care, I just slept and waited for him to check on me.   someone helped me to to tiolet, chills are under control if I have a blanket on me. The house is not cold, someone has the wood stove cranking that night, it's 70 in my bedroom.  I sleep all night Wednesday.   6:30am: Thursday My eyes still hurt, I'm still hot. I don't care what my temp is. No more chills.  I'm smelly from sweating all night. I'm motivated to shower, I think maybe I can do stuff today, I try to plan some things for the day. I shower and eat some oatmeal. I'm exhausted from doing those two things.   My lower back/hips and neck are and shoulders are tight and sore, aches all over, especially neck. It's hard to think, brain fog, finding the right words. The injection site is not really sore though (last time it was).   I have to just go back to bed. I sleep all day Thursday. Get up late afternoon to eat a little bit (soup and crackers) I try to watch TV. I  can't focus on the show. I go back to bed by 5:30pm. I look at dumb funny videos on social media. Asleep by 6pm on Thursday evening. Sleep all night and wake up Friday 5am.  I'm able to function and do most of my usual activities on Friday, but not very motivated to exercise or go for with dogs like I normally would do. Still stiff muscles. I do play in snow Friday night with dogs.   By Saturday most of the stiffness is much better, I'm moving, walking dogs outside, moving furniture, doing my  usual activities.

She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment & Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment & Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study.

1056911,02/26/2021,NY,39.0,39,,F,,"Event: Allergic reaction on 3/24. The injection site began to itch around 9:30pm after taking a hot shower. Approximately 10 minutes later the injection site area swelled and became ""hard"" to the touch, then turn red, hot, and tender to the touch. The area affected was approximately 3 inches wide and 4 inches long - it covered the upper arm (deltoid muscle area). Within 5 minutes the itching sensation spread over the upper back on the left side and to the left side of my neck. Approximately 20 minutes later my bottom lip on the left-hand side swelled slightly and turned red and I had a slight difficulty swallowing. My breathing was not impeded. The reaction did not progress further (I had taken allergy medication to stop any further reaction). By 11pm the difficulty swallowing disappeared and the swelling in my lip reduced. By 5:30am I had no trouble with swallowing and there was no facial swelling. The swelling in my arm was reduced by half - although it was still warm, sensitive, and itched. Throughout the day (on 3/25) the swelling and redness at the injection site reduced. Two days after the start of the event, the area is still warm to the touch and will itch on occasion as will my lower left lip.  Treatment: as soon as I recognized it was an allergic reaction, when the area swelled, I took half a Wal-Zyr 10mg tablet (so I took 5mg of Walgreen's generic brand of Zyrtec) - approximately 9:45pm on 3/24. I took the other half (5mg) of the tablet at 5:30am the next morning on 3/25. No additional medication has been taken since.  Outcomes: The reaction was managed with the Wal-Zyr medication. Currently the injection area is slightly warm and itches on occasion, as does my lower left lip.

The maternal estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 06-Jun-2020 and corrected estimated data of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 12-Jun-2020. The type of pregnancy was singleton.  On 25-Oct-2019, the ultrasound revealed no MCMs.  On 26-Nov-2019, the nuchal translucency revealed thickened nuchal fold. No MCMs were noted. The non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) revealed no MCMs.  On 26-Dec-2019, the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening (MSAFP)/serum markers revealed no MCMs.  On 27-Jan-2020, at approximately 21 weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the neonate's mother was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, anatomical location and route of administration: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100112488.  On the same day, the 20-week anatomy ultrasound revealed no MCMs.  On 24-Feb-2020, 28 days after vaccination, the neonate's mother experienced acid reflux and started treatment with Pepcid (famotidine) at dose of 20 mg, every day, orally.  At 41 weeks of gestation (as reported), the mother delivered live birth, female neonate via vaginal delivery method. The neonate's birth weight was 4167 g, body length, head circumference and appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at one, five and ten minutes were not reported. There were no MCMs identified at birth. No pregnancy complications were noted on delivery.  The outcome of event 'high birthweight baby' was not reported.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The event 'high birthweight baby' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  The case is linked to 202002688, the corresponding mother case.  Company comment: A female neonate was exposed to the suspect product, Afluria QIV. The neonate's mother was vaccinated with Afluria QIV at approximately 21 weeks of gestation. Neonate's weight on birth was 4167 grams. Causality between suspect product and event of large for dates baby is assessed as not related due to biological implausibility.

The patient's relevant medical history and patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On 11-Oct-2018, the patient was vaccinated with Afluria (TIV) (influenza vaccine, dose, route of administration, indication and anatomical location: not reported). The batch number reported was YT38207B, expiry date: 30-Jun-2019.   On the same day, that night after receiving Afluria (TIV), the patient felt bad.  On 12-Oct-2018, the patient recovered from event of feeling bad.   On an unspecified day in Oct-2018, reported as the following week, the patient woke up with terrible headache. He went to Urgent Care and was sent to the emergency room. The patient was diagnosed with migraine.    On an unspecified day in Oct-2018, the patient started having infections, inflammatory reactions, abnormal kidney function, Hashimoto Disease, cervical (C)7 radiculopathy, nerve damage, triceps damage, multiple T2 hypersensitivity related to MRI, the benign of nodule in left eye and on thyroid, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, short term memory issues and increased CSF protein.  On 26-Oct-2018, the patient was hospitalised, but no further details were provided.   On 27-Oct-2018, the patient was discharged from hospital.   On an unspecified day in Jan-2020, reported as last January, the patient was diagnosed with post ischemic gliosis on the brain. The patient saw multiple physicians.   On an unspecified date, reported as now, the patient had reactivated virus in central nervous system.   On an unspecified date, the vaccine ruined the patient's nursing career and he was applying for disability and looking into compensation fund.  At the time of initial reporting on 19-Feb-2021, the patient did not recover from the events.  The reporter assessed all events as related. He stated that Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reported 18 reactions from this lot number and he would like to know if we have performed any quality check (QC). He stated we have immunity from prosecution, and he was sure we do not perform the QC. The vaccine had ruined his nursing career and he was applying for disability and looking into Program for funds. The patient read online that there were bad adverse reactions to squalene.  The events of migraine, 'infection', 'inflammatory reaction', 'cervical radiculopathy', nerve damage, 'muscle damage', 'benign thyroid nodule', 'nodule' and 'fibromyalgia' were assessed as serious due to the criterion of hospitalization. The events of 'function kidney abnormal' and 'Hashimoto's disease' were assessed as serious due to the criterion of hospitalization and medical significance. The event of 'impaired work ability' was assessed as serious due to criterion of disability.  Company Comment: A 49-year-old male patient developed renal impairment, autoimmune thyroiditis, migraine, infection, inflammation, cervical radiculopathy, nerve injury, muscle injury, benign neoplasm of thyroid gland and nodule (both reported as benign nodule in left eye and on thyroid), fibromyalgia, impaired work ability, viral infection (reported as reactivated virus in central nervous system), gliosis (reported as post ischemic gliosis) and feeling abnormal after vaccination with the suspect product, Afluria (TIV).

All other events developed within a month, chronology is therefore assessed as plausible. Information regarding the underlying medical history and concomitant medications have not been provided. More clarification regarding the performed MRI and other related findings is needed. Due to lack of information, causality for the event viral infection is unassessable. Since information regarding the aetiology and pathohistology of benign neoplasm of thyroid gland and nodule was not reported, causality is unassessable.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as ""localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given"". On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown.

The maternal concurrent conditions included anaemia and gestational thrombocytopenia. The mother's concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (minerals not specified (nos), vitamins nos) used for pregnancy, Injectafer (ferric carboxymaltose), ferrous sulfate and Ferralet (ferrous gluconate), all used for anemia.  The maternal obstetrical history noted that the neonate's mother had no previous pregnancies. The mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCMs). The neonate's mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 30-Jul-2019, the estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 05-May-2020, while the corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 11-May-2020. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 24-Sep-2019, the ultrasound scan revealed no MCM.  On 29-Oct-2019, non-invasive prenatal test and nuchal translucency revealed no MCMs.  On 26-Nov-2019, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening (MSAFP), serum markers revealed no MCMs.  On 07-Jan-2020, at approximately 23 weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the neonate's mother was administered Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, anatomical location and route of administration: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100112488.  On the same day, 20-week anatomy ultrasound scan revealed no MCM.  At gestational age of 37 weeks (as reported), the mother delivered vaginally a live birth, male neonate. The neonate birth weight was 2438 grams, head circumference and length were not reported. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores at one, five and 10 minutes were not provided. No MCM was identified at birth.  The outcome of the event was not reported.   The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The event of 'low birth weight baby' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked with the case 202002354, the corresponding mother case.  Company comment: A male neonate patient experienced low birth weight, approximately 14 weeks after maternal receipt of Afluria QIV. Chronology is plausible. As reported, the maternal obstetrical history noted that the neonate's mother had no previous pregnancies. The mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCMs).

I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn't used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn't sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating ""I think your just nervous."" Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor's office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she's on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they're afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.

It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the ""muscle aches"" described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor.

At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels > 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was >90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient's code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care.

He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would ""spread"" across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn't sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2.

1059445,02/27/2021,NY,47.0,47,,M,,"On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3+ hours (which is about as long as I've been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.",,,,,,,,Y,N,02/11/2021,02/23/2021,12,Blood work taken on 2/26/2021  CT scan on 2/26/2021  Neurologist appointment scheduled for 3/1,OTH,,none,none,none,,,2,02/27/2021,,Y,,"environmental allergies (dust, pollen, etc.)  almonds"

I have two oximeters, to, um, verify each other, so I am reasonably confident of their readings. I have a background in physics so I have some experience with instrumentation.

While I have had a few itchy pimple areas for several weeks, and am generally sensitive to everything, this is not the same. It is also not the same as the transient flushing that I have in my face for a few minutes each morning after I take 500 mg. of Niacin.   2/23/21 (Tues.) ? At 8:30 a.m. I had flushing (not quite a noticeable rash) on my back, face, shoulders and both arms, esp. the L arm. (This was 20-30 minutes after I had taken Niacin, but the brief flushing, just in my face, resulting from the Niacin was long gone before these other rashes/flushing occurred.) Later, after 9:00 a.m., there was warmth and itching on my lower back. At 9:45 a.m. I felt flushing in my thighs and lower legs. At 10:00 a.m. there was an actual red rash on my chest and stomach. This all seems unusual for one week after the CoVID-19 shot.     2/27/21 (Sat.) ? Starting at 9:50 a.m. (30 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest and upper back. After a few minutes the flushing and itching spread to my lower back, and my upper arms; my upper arms had a noticeable rash, which then spread down to my hands. In the next few minutes the flushing, itching and rash extended to my upper inner thighs and lower back (although I am only assuming, based on the feeling of flushing and itching, that my lower back had a rash, since I couldn?t see there). Over the next several minutes the itching and rash extended to the front and side of my thighs, down to my knees. The rash then extended, to a lesser extent, down to my ankles. As of 10:50 a.m. I still have this flushing, itching and/or rash in all the places mentioned, although it has started to decrease.

I had 3 episodes of sharp adominal pain that radiated up my back and made me short of breath. I felt pain between my shoulder blades when I tried to breathe in. The first two subsided, but the third episode on 02/16/21 was more pronounced. I felt generally unwell, like something was really wrong. I first thought it was a normal immune response or side effect. But the nausea and abdominal pain had grown worse. On 02/16/2021 I went to the ER, where a CT Scan showed I had Epiploic Appendagitis. I suspect the inflammation or a sudden ischemic event after my vaccine had caused this. I had absolutely no such symptoms prior to the vaccine, but the nausea came on exactly 4 hours after my first dose like a switch had been turned on.    In addition to the above, I experience facial flushing on the left side of my face for about 7 days after the vaccine. My forehead and right side of my face would read a normal temperature, but my left cheek averaged 101 degrees. The flushing would come on suddenly, often in the evening. I also had heart palpitations.   Other symptoms: I had the typical sore left arm for a few days. I developed joint pain on my left side, including my arm and my jaw.

On a scale of 1-10, I?d rate the severity as a 10. This lasted approximately 15 minutes.   Over the ensuing 5 days I had noticeable but tolerable intermittent right arm pain. Then beginning on the 10th day following injection, I experienced sudden and severe right shoulder pain that traveled down my biceps into my elbow again. I'd rate the pain at a 9 on the same scale. This time however, the pain started around 11 pm and did not subside. I tried sleeping but couldn?t. I got up and spent the rest of the night holding my arm to immobilize it, however that did nothing to stop the pain. It was about 5 am when I finally took 50 mg diclofenac and in about 2 hours the pain subsided to a tolerable 4 on the same pain scale.   As the day wore on, the pain increased again to a level 9 without medication so I continued with 50 mg diclofenac every 8 hours over the following 4 days and knocked it back to a level 3. This pain has occurred in my right shoulder, biceps, elbow, forearm and even my fingers and intensifies toward evening. I have been able to tolerate the pain without medication at about a level 3 for the past 2 days. However, I take a 50 mg tab of diclofenac an hour or 2 before bed as the pain intensifies toward evening. This has allowed me to sleep through the night.   In addition to the arm pain I developed muscle weakness in my right biceps about 3 days ago and am unable to lift my right arm above my head. The pain is not what prevents the movement. It?s as though my arm is not receiving the nerve impulse to move. Taking all of this together, I?d say that immunization appears to have triggered Parsonage Turner Syndrome. As I understand this immune-mediated syndrome, several events can trigger it, including immunization. I experienced this phenomenon one other time, approximately 2 years ago but did not correlate it to a vaccination at the time. This time it?s too apparent. I wonder how many other reports you?ve received that are like this and whether the vaccines will trigger the same reactions. I also wonder now whether I should receive a Moderna ?booster? if needed in the near to long term.

The parents provided signed, informed consent forms and paperwork for all 5 individuals. Against the parent's initial request, I denied the COVID-19 vaccination to the 13 year old patient. In accordance with the parents? initial request, I administered the vaccine to the other 4 family members, including the 4 year old patient. Active clinical trials and articles with data to support the use of the COVID-19 vaccination in children are below. During my years working at acute care facilities where successful use of medications were often supported by primary literature and clinical trials, I made a judgment decision to administer the vaccination to the 4 year old citing previous success from previous experiences and the below references.

It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.

They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT's and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.

She received the vaccination on 2/14/2021 and became very confused.  She had significant left arm swelling much worse than when she had her first vaccination.  Her husband brought her to the emergency room and she was eventually discharged, but she went on to develop significant hypertension and she reported that her blood pressures were normal prior to the vaccination.  She had an emergency room visit in which her systolic pressures were well above 240.  She revisited the emergency room and had elevated blood pressures of 240 and was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy and later found to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES.  We have started the patient on medications, and started laboratory work-up for secondary hypertension and her blood pressures have improved with treatment.  We discussed the case with the neurologist, who suggested that we repeat MRI scan to make sure that her punctate lesions noted on MRI on this admission on 2/25/2021, have resolved.  It was advised that if they had not resolved that we should call neurology again.  Hypertensive encephalopathy is rare and press syndrome as a result is also rare.

That evening it was painful and disrupted my sleep. The next morning (Thursday) I was somewhat feverish. By the mid-morning my fever was up to 100.4, and by the late afternoon it was up to 101.4. I felt exhausted -- too exhausted to even write an email. I had chills, backache,  and slept nearly the entire day (~8 hours). Based on this, I would call this day a 4 in terms of severity.   The next day (Friday), my fever had declined to 100.2 but was still elevated, but now I had a backache (lower back), and I was still weak. However, I could get out of bed for about 10 minutes without too much difficulty. I slept for about 5 hours during the day. This may also qualify as a 4.  On Saturday, my fever had declined further to 99.4, and my energy level was somewhat better.  Even so, most of the day was spent in bed, but I slept less during the day than on the previous days (about 3 hours). The main thing that was a problem on Saturday besides being weak was a headache. This is a strange thing because I rarely have had headaches in my life.  This is a pounding in the front of my head, only occurring when going from an upright position into a seated or supine position. Most of the headache disappears in about 30 seconds.  Overall I would say Saturday was a 3 in terms of severity. Today (Sunday) my temperature seems to be normal (98.6) -- though this is a full degree above what is normal for me. However, the headache has become worse -- it was hurting me while sleeping, and woke me up from the discomfort.  I still have the backache, and I am still weak.

By the time I went to sleep, it was uncomfortable to sleep on that side, and it started to itch a bit. The next day (2/26, day 8 post injection) I had flu-like symptoms - very bad headache, fatigue, body aches, and slightly elevated temp (99.4-99.9) - general malaise. I took some Advil in the evening to help with the headache and general malaise and it worked. My arm still hurt and was itchy on and off. By Saturday (2/27, day 9) the flu like symptoms were mostly gone (yay), but I woke up with  a large, red, slightly raised bump and was itchy on and off at the injection site. It was BRIGHT RED and HOT to the touch. Today, day 10, it is still red but a much more dull red, and not as hot to touch, and doesn't hurt as much. So I think it's clearing up! I should note that I once had a very similar reaction to a flu shot, about 5 years ago, and thus continue to get my  flu shot in the doctor's office just to be safe, and I sit for 15 minutes to ensure I don't get a reaction. I had a red, warm, itchy welt around the injection site. The reaction I had with my flu shot was also several days after the injection, but not as many as the Moderna shot.  I have read that this is called ""Covid arm"" and a known reaction which is comforting, but I wanted to be sure to report it BECAUSE SCIENCE is important. I also understand this should not deter me from getting my second dose, but I am curious to know if I should expect the same reaction? The article I read suggested getting the second dose in the OPPOSITE arm, which would be my dominant arm (I am a lefty.) I am hoping someone from VAERS can advise me if I should switch arms, or even delay my vaccine. Right now, dose two is scheduled for 3/17, 4 weeks after my first dose.
