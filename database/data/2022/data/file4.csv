Continued taking the amoxicillin until the end of day and then decided to discontinue.   Next day (9/6) the fever subsided and muscle soreness got steadily better. Large light red ""bruise"" color appeared visible on my inner left arm covering most of the biceps down to the elbow. As the fever subsided, I felt a general allergic response that felt like it was taxing my adrenals (as a lifelong asthmatic, allergy, eczema sufferer I know this feeling, except this felt stronger than normal and made me weak).   On 9/7, the skin on back of my hands and fingers became very thick and swollen (both hands). By the end of the day, small blisters were forming all over the swollen areas. They did not itch like eczema, though there was a slight burning sensation so I iced them down periodically and continued taking ibuprofen to control inflammation.  On 9/8, the blistered areas started to ooze liquid that has a distinct odor (almost smells like industrial oil or lubricant). The ares are starting to dry out a bit and the burning is getting more pronounced. I presume this is part of the healing process. I can still feel a bit of overall allergy response (that adrenal feeling) but less than before.  Finally, I want to add that I get the flu shot every year (for past two decades) and have received many other vaccines including previous ones for pneumonia, hepatitis, and pretty much everything else that was available.

As I drove home, it was difficult to keep my arm propped onto the steering wheel due to the pain, so I decided to just drive with my right hand. When I got home, I expressed my discomfort to my wife. I would rotate my arm in circles to try and circulate the blood and hopefully help the pain go away. It hurt very bad to lift my arm, especially above shoulder height. I was nervous because I was scheduled to work my warehouse job the next day and wasn't sure I would be able to complete my work properly. The next morning, my arm was still very sore but I decided to go to work anyway and thought moving it around more and using it would help. I limited my use of my left arm, but it was still very sore throughout the day. This pain lasted for about 5 days before it started to subside slightly. It would still be very painful to lift my arm over shoulder height. After another week, it got to the point where I could lift my arm over my shoulder without any initial sharp pain, but if I lifted it up or moved it around a certain way there would be a very uncomfortable deep tissue pinching type sensation, almost like my muscles were catching onto each other.

0883267,09/12/2020,TN,28.0,28,,F,,"I came into the ER on 7/3/2020 due to a cellulitis infection on my foot, as a complication of a bee sting from a week before that. I was given a pill and two shots--one in my hip, and a tetanus shot in my shoulder. The tetanus shot was not to treat the cellulitus; they asked me when I last had a tetanus shot and I didn't remember, so they (hastily) recommended that I get one.  The shot was administered into my left arm, high up near my shoulder. It pinched like any other vaccine, and immediately after was sore which was to be expected? but I also noticed I could not lift or extend my arm too far or at certain angles, because it felt weak and caused pain. My shoulder also hurt.  I expected the pain to disappear or at least lessen within the next few days, but it did not. A week later, it still hurt just as much and I had the same limited mobility, plus general weakness that affected my whole arm (especially while lifting/extending it) and in my fingers.  The new pain and mobility issues in my arm were interfering with daily tasks such as taking a shower (trying to scrub my back hurt), getting dressed, and working at my computer (typing). It got worse at night when I was trying to sleep, and I had pain or discomfort in most sleeping positions but it was worse if I slept on my left side. It also got worse when I moved it too much. Sometimes rest or exercise helped but sometimes it just made it worse.  I should mention that these symptoms are not normal for me, which I found concerning.  About 1.5 weeks after the vaccine, I started experiencing pain in my left hand. I also noticed that after waking up, my left hand would be numb and tingly. Ever since I developed these arm/shoulder symptoms, my left hand was very numb in comparison to my right upon waking up, especially when sleeping on my left side. Like when legs fall asleep, moving my hand around made the numbness go away after a few minutes.  I know that in most cases, pain from vaccines goes away after 2-3 days. So I did some research and my symptoms seem to match something called SIRVA, or Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration. Symptoms often include arm and shoulder pain, shoulder dysfunction, limited range of motion, tingling or loss of feeling, and weakness. If untreated it can cause issues like frozen shoulder or nerve injury. It?s typically caused by an incorrect method in giving a vaccine, for instance, by putting the needle in too high on the arm or too deep into the muscle.  The pain persisted for about 3 weeks, and gradually lessened. I still could not lift anything heavy, sleep on my left side, or extend my left arm in certain directions without a range of mild discomfort or pain... like when I reach to scratch my back or attempt to put on a tight shirt (getting my arms in requires specific movement). My mobility is still limited, but not quite as much as it was in the first week. My mobility is definitely more limited than it was before I got the vaccine.  I still have these symptoms currently (9/12/20), which have somewhat (but not entirely) lessened with treatment (steroid shot in my shoulder (9/01/2020). I have been seeking testing and treatment with a bone & joint doctor  who confirmed via X-Ray (7/21/2020) and MRI (8/27/20) that I have tendonitis in my shoulder. I started with the X-Rays and returned for an MRI when I saw no improvement in symptoms after following through with ice and exercises, and got the steroid shot during my follow up visit after the MRI.",,,,,,,,,N,07/03/2020,07/03/2020,0,X-Rays (7/21/2020) = Tendonitis of left rotator cuff (M75.82) MRI (8/27/2020) = Tendonitis of left rotator cuff (M75.82),PVT,,PRESCRIPTION MEDS Azelastine HCI Nasal Solution 0.1% 137 mcg/spray Fluticasone Nasal Spray 60mcg Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol 90 mcg per actuation  VITAMINS / SUPPLEMENTS Omega-3 Fish Oil (High EPA: 1200mg - DHA: 900mg = 1 dose / 3,,"Mitral-valve prolapse (managed) Asthma (exercise-induced, managed) Autism OCD PTSD",,,2,09/12/2020,,Y,,Latex allergy (mild) gluten intolerance (mild) lactose intolerance (moderate)

I would go to sleep and then wake up with these sudden bruises that were not there the night before. After the two weeks of symptoms, I told my OB who ordered a CBC. I was admitted to the hospital right away with a platelet count of 12. I was diagnosed with ITP. Doctors ruled out HELLP, pre-eclampsia, or infections. I was given two platelet transfusions and four day course of Dexamethasone because my platelet count was critically low and unsafe to have my planned c section. Those treatments were able to get me to a count of 47. The ITP continued to worsen after birth with a count of 7. I began high does Prednisone 70mg with a taper over 5 months. I had four Rituximab chemo infusions. I had to stop breastfeeding which was crushing  and overwhelmingly sad due to the Rituximab. It wasn't safe for baby. I had about nine IVIG infusions. Nothing was working. IVIG would last about two weeks. This went on for several months. I continued to bruise on my arms and legs, and have petechia. I was fatigued.

This literature marketed report has been received from the authors of a published literature article and was presented for the long-term safety and efficacy of short-course immune tolerance induction (ITI) in a relatively large cohort of cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-negative and CRIM-positive infantile Pompe disease (IPD) patients by evaluating anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), B cell and T cell quantitation, vaccination history and titers against vaccines, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and overall and ventilator-free survival. Vaccine titers were available and adequate humoral response was observed in all except an inadequate response to the Pneumococcal vaccine in two CRIM-positive IPD patients which was as following.  This literature report refers to a male patient, who was currently 5.9-years-old (reported as 70.9 months). The patient's relevant medical history was not reported. Concurrent condition included CRIM-positive infantile Pompe disease. Concomittant therapies were not reported. On and unknown date, the patient had received a short-course of ITI with rituximab, methotrexate (dose, frequency, route, batch/lot# was not reported) in enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for infantile Pompe disease and was subsequently vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) (dose, frequency, anatomical location, batch/lot# were unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient received 1 round of immune tolerance induction. Cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status on an unknown date was positive.  On an unknown date, the CRIM-positive IPD patient demonstrated an inadequate response to certain serotypes of the pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) (reported as ""pneumococcal vaccine"") (therapeutic response decreased).  It was reported that the patient was vaccinated prior to enzyme replacement therapy. The patients B cell reconstitution, vaccination status at baseline and after ITI, and titers against routine vaccines were collected. On an unknown date, gene encoding acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) disease-associated variants for allele 1 was c.2457_246delCTG and for allele 2 was c.2560C greater than T. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) dose at the time of initiation 20 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) every other week (EOW). Patient was initiated on or subsequently received ERT at a higher dose than the recommended dose of 20 mg/kg EOW. B Cell recovery was found 13 weeks post rituximab (RTX). Weeks post-RTX at last CD19 percentage was 248 weeks. Anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers at peak titers was 0, at last titers was 0 (171 weeks on ERT) and was immune tolerant. The patient's humoral response to routine vaccinations was reviewed and response to tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella was found adequate and response to Pneumoccocal strain was confirmed to be inadequate.   Efficacy of ERT and ITI: Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) baseline was at 186 and final assessment was 61 (81 weeks on ERT).  Motor Status was reviewed: Baseline revealed good muscle strength, tone. Minimal head lag, lifts head up and Final assessment revealed to be not ambulatory, does not move legs in supine, requires assistance for head control in supported sitting (274 weeks on ERT). Ventilation Status: Baseline revealed no support and final assessment was reported as invasively ventilated (27weeks on ERT).

Typing up patient's flu shot on 9/15/20 i realized that I had given patient a egg free flu shot (flublok)(on 9/14/20 clinic) due to his discovered allergy to eggs at the clinic when i asked him even though his sheet stated he wasnt. Flublok was chosen to minimize his reaction to the flu shot due to his potential egg allergy. When entering in his RX on 9/15 I noticed that Flublok is only indicated for ages 18+. upon doing research, newer studies show that Flublok is actually just as safe and efficacious as fluarix in ages 7-17 so there was minimal need for concern. I spoke with patient's mom on 9/15/20 at 5:00 PM and explained the situation and asked how patient was doing. Both of her sons had gotten the flu shot that day and both were feeling a little under the weather but besides that they were fine. She was understanding of the situation and thanked me for explaining and telling her what i had discovered. I told her that I would let the provider know as well since the vaccine was technically off label for his age group still. I called Dr's office on 9/15/20 at 5:08 pm and spoke with his nurse and explained the entire situation again. The nurse was ok with what had happened and told me she would pass on the information to Dr as well so that he could be made aware and document this as well. I will make a dispensing error report and VAERS form tonight just to cover what happened and keep this documented. 9/15/20 at 5:19pm",,,,,,,,,Y,09/14/2020,09/15/2020,1,,PHM,,none,none,none,,,2,09/15/2020,,,,Eggs (itchy)

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.

The batch number reported was 279786 and expiry date was 31-Aug-2020.  On the same day, after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, the patient experienced some soreness.  On 06-Sep-2020 at 2am, one day after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, the patient woke up with chills. During the day, the patient ran a low grade temperature about 100F for a few hours and had some vomiting.

On 08-Sep-2020, three days after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, the patient woke up nauseated with full blown vertigo and had to lay down. The patient was very unbalanced and hadn't eaten while deafness remained. The patient contacted medical doctor (MD) and they set him up for Covid test tomorrow at 2pm and prescribed nausea medication. The nausea has passed and he has now had a bowel movement (BM) and that has helped.  On 06-Sep-2020, the patient recovered from the events of chills, fever and vomiting.

The reporter assessed the events as serious.  Company comment: Balance disorder, deafness, pain, vertigo, decreased appetite, pyrexia, vomiting, chills and nausea was associated with the use of the suspect product Fluad Quadrivalent.

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported however, there was a suspicion on COVID infection, but this was not confirmed. With information presented, causality is assessed as possibly related for pain, vertigo, decreased appetite, pyrexia, vomiting, chills and nausea due to plausible temporal relationship and lack of confounding factors.

Went home and within a couple hours upper arm became very painful, never had that much pain from previous flu injections) so placed ice on upper arm and took Tylenol.  By 5 pm I could not lift my arm and had extreme pain running down arm and into the fingers. When I took my shower later that evening I noticed the bandage was placed high up shoulder near joint. I found that very unusual. Took more pain reliever and another ice pack and went to bed. Continued ice and pain reliever throughout Sat, Oct. 1.  At 9:07 pm I contacted Dr., my  primary physician, via the messaging system and relayed what I was experiencing and my fear there was a possible injury to my shoulder.  His response: Having a bad reaction, which is not unusual. Ice and take Tylenol; pain should be gone within 3 days. See immune responses like this quite often.  Rest assure the shoulder joint is fine.  Sunday there was swelling and redness.  On Monday, Oct 5 I called the clinic and appointment was scheduled to see NP, as Dr. was on vacation.  Appointment was scheduled for Oct. 9 @ 2:20 pm.  NP and the staff manager, both examined the arm and stated injection was definitely given in or near the joint.  An ultrasound was scheduled for the next morning at the Medical Center, Results:  ultrasound was normal, no signs of fluid collection, no foreign body. Should resolve in a week.  Pain continued and I decided to get appointment with my Orthopedic Doctor. Appt:  Oct. 28, 2019.  X-ray was taken.  Diagnoses:  Inflammation of shoulder and Frozen Shoulder.

That afternoon she began noticing numbness and tingling of her fingers and toes. That evening she could not get off the toilet; she was too weak in the legs. She needed to use a medical alert device to get help. Normally she used a walker. She notified EMS, who transported her to the hospital. In the ED she was found to hypertensive (190s), O2 sats 87%, urine with possible infection, and CXR with possible pneumonia vs aspiration but normal procalcitonin. She has required bipap. Admitted 9/9/20. Yesterday she reported improved sensation in her limbs. On exam for hospitalist, she was areflexic and weak. She had LP, which showed Prot 75. Decision was last night to delay IVIG to see how she looks today. She reports numbness now rising up to her lower abdomen. She is still requiring bipap and has air hunger when it is turned off.

We will put her on 10/5 pressure support today. She also need protracted rehab but she is now bedbound until she potentially regains functional status. We will therefore try to have her placed in LTAC to assist with both the ventilator weaning and rehabilitation from yellow-gray syndrome. Regarding other active medical issues she is still slightly hypervolemic we will continue Lasix and Diamox. Regarding her A. fib this is well controlled with her current dose of diltiazem. She is on anticoagulation for this. Regarding her pneumonia she is completed a course of antibiotics. She is still has MRSA in his sputum culture.

For this  current pregnancy, due date is 11/11/2020.   On September 2, 2020, I received the Tdap Vaccine given at my 30 week prenatal visit. CMA administered vaccine. Discussed receiving the shot in the dominant arm as using the arm could help decrease discomfort/pain due to vaccine. Shot was given in upper right deltoid. I remember thinking the shot was administered high compared to any IM shots received before.  Within 2-3 hours, there was general soreness noted in upper extremity around injection site. Pain level 2-3 out of 10.  By the evening, the pain had increased significantly with pain radiating deep within shoulder. I remember describing the pain to my family as though my shoulder was ?out of socket?. Couldn?t lean/sleep on right side that night or perform many activities of daily living due to pain when reaching across my body. Pain 6-7 out of 10.  By the next day,  the pain continued to increase.  Pain radiated in upper shoulder/deltoid area. Continued to be unable to sleep on my right side (making it extremely difficult to sleep at all as pregnancy makes me unable to sleep on back or stomach), take off my bra, reach overhead, wrap towel around myself, put my daughter in her car seat. At rest, pain averaged 6-7 out of 10. When moving arm, especially at end range, pain was 8 out of 10. Continued to wait it out as I was told pain/discomfort could last for a couple days.  On 9/8 I reached out to Dr. as the pain had continued and felt ""wrong."" Doctor recommended scheduling with primary care doctor or going to urgent care as the pain should have been decreasing by that time.  Also prescribed Tylenol. Scheduled appointment with primary care physician on 9/15 and began taking Tylenol for pain management with very little change in pain levels. Warm showers would provide temporary relief. Discontinued Tylenol due to little to no change in pain levels. Night time was the worst as the pain made it difficult to sleep because of pain/ache/burning sensation in affected right shoulder. And I feel uncomfortable taking medication during pregnancy when it isn?t making a difference. Over the next few days, pain began to subside and I was able to complete self-care tasks independently again, but still with pain. Though continued to have difficulty picking up my toddler and sleeping. Pain 2 out of 10. 5 out of 10 if slept on. Would wake myself up at night from pain of lying on right arm.  09/11/2020 was a ROUGH night. Could not get rid of ache, keeping me up a majority of the night.   On 09/15/2020, I went to see primary physician. Physician states she believes pain is due to poor administration of vaccine, placement ?too high?. And has resulted in acute myofascial pain (per physician note). During appointment, doctor reports that her diagnosis is inflammation secondary to incorrect placement of injection which is causing impingement of nerve, explaining the pain experienced at end range of certain movements. Physician performed basic ROM with me, abduction/adduction and external/internal rotation. Only applied weight/pressure on front ROM. Did not perform any functional assessments. I verbalized pain at end ranges of external rotation and overhead movements. Physician reports that she expects the issue to resolve within weeks/a month or so. Advised ice and Tylenol for pain management. When I asked about testing/radiology of any kind, she had no recommendations at this time. Physician states that ultrasound would not show any symptoms. Doctor advises to continue to keep her and my OB doctors in loop if pain continues.  By 09/16/2020, pain was back to 2 out of 10.  On 09/17/2020 had 32 week prenatal visit with Dr. Discussed pain since receiving tdap shot at 30 week visit. Doctor extremely apologetic but also unable to recommend any other forms of medication for pain relief at this time due to pregnant state. Advised to continue to follow up at subsequent appointments if pain continues. Another night of aching throughout the right arm. The following morning, pain radiated into forearm and towards wrist. General aching 2/3 out of 10. Consistent ache/tension in shoulder throughout day. On 09/18/2020, I dropped a bottle of creamer, which busted on the floor, when right arm ?caught? and sharp pain surprised me. At rest, arm continues to feel heavy and as though it has been overused, even though I have been using it less. As of 09/20/2020, there?s a constant ache in my shoulder during the day ? continues to keep me awake at night.  As of today, 9/22, ache/pain in arm continues.

I took some Tylenol and Niquil cough medicine and I was able to sleep several hours in the afternoon and then a good 8 hours that night.

Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of cytomegalovirus viremia in a 50-years old female patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to first patient reported in this literature article. The patient had past medical history of hypertension, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis) underwent a renal transplant (initial transplant) from a living unrelated donor in June 2016. The Donor CMV status was CMV seropositive and the recipient CMV status was CMV seronegative. Induction immunosuppressive regimen included anti-thymocyte globulin, methylprednisolone and intravenous immune-globulin (IVIG). Recent inflammatory disease processes (allograft rejection, infection) included donor-specific antibody mediated rejection. The patient had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection. Time period between transplant and inflammatory disease process was 4 months. Treatments for inflammatory disease processes included IVIG, rituximab and apheresis. Duration of inflammatory disease process was 1 month. The patient had no prior episodes of CMV reactivation. Primary/secondary CMV prophylaxis included off CMV prophylaxis at the time of disease presentation. The patient had no recent increase in maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Time period between transplant and presentation was 17 months. No information on patient's family history was provided. On an unspecified date in November 2017, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided) at the outpatient transplant nephrology clinic. The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date, 8 days after the vaccination, the patient presented to next appointment with complaints of fever with chills, night sweats, lethargy, headaches, myalgias, nausea, anorexia, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and multiple episodes of watery, non-bloody diarrhea. The patient was directed to the emergency department for further evaluation. Prophylactic medications at the time of presentation included sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) single-strength (SS) 1-tablet oral (PO) every twenty-four hours (QD). The patient denied sick contacts, recent travel, medication changes or medication non-compliance. At the time of admission, the patient was on prednisone 5 mg PO (oral) QD, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 360 mg PO QID, tacrolimus 0.5 mg PO BID. The patient's vitals on admission were significant for temperature 101.7 F, heart rate 100/minute, blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, respirations 18/minute and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical exam revealed no acute abnormalities. Admission labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) 2,070/cubic mm [normal range (N): 3,800-10,500/cubic mm], absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1,865/cubic mm [N: 1,800-7,400/cubic mm], lymphocyte count 500/cubic mm [N: 1,000-3,300/cubic mm], platelets 108,000/cubic mm [N: 150,000-400,00/cubic mm], aspartate transaminase (AST) 81 U/l [N: 10-40 U/l], alanine transaminase (ALT) 87 U/l [N: 10-45 U/l], alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 137 U/l [N: 40-120 U/l] and normal renal function. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with no acute changes. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) ruled out the presence of pneumonia. Abdominal ultrasound showed polycystic liver and kidneys, contracted gallbladder with negative sonographic Murphy's sign. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed polycystic liver and kidneys, as well as mural thickening of ascending colon with mild surrounding inflammatory changes (suggestive of colitis). Urinalysis was not suggestive of infection. Respiratory viral panel multiplex test was negative. Clostridium difficile toxin test was negative. Stool cultures were negative. Stool microscopy was negative for ova and parasites. Urine cultures revealed Escherichia coli (10,000-49,000 CFU/ml) combined with normal urogenital flora. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Testing for acute hepatitis A, B and C viruses was negative. Epstein-Barr virus serology revealed prior infection. BK virus DNA, Parvovirus B19 DNA and adenovirus DNA were not detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Infectious diseases service was consulted. Given the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis and multi-systemic symptoms, there was concern for an ongoing viral process. The patient was started on valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID for presumed CMV disease, with intravenous fluid support. The E. coli in the urine was thought to be a colonization and the patient was successfully monitored off antibiotics. The patient continued to have persistent fevers and diarrhea, with worsening leukopenia (lowest WBC count 1700/cubic mm with lowest ANC 800/cubic mm), thrombocytopenia (nadir 86,000/cubic mm) and liver function abnormalities (AST 139 U/l, ALT 135 U/l, ALP 167 U/l). Given the persistent symptoms and worsening laboratory parameters, MMF was discontinued. Serum CMV PCR testing revealed 154,697 IU/ml (5.19 log10 IU/ml) [lower limit of assay detection 60 IU/ml (1.78 log10 IU/ml)]. Gastroenterology service was consulted for worsening liver function abnormalities and it was attributed the clinical picture to systemic CMV infection. The patient had clinical improvement, with improving CMV PCR tests [504 IU/ml (2.70 log10 IU/ml)] after 12 days of antiviral therapy. The patient was discharged on the twelfth day of hospital stay, with recovery of WBC count to 5,600/cubic mm and platelets 147,000/cubic mm. The patient was followed up by in the outpatient transplant nephrology and infectious diseases clinics. CMV PCR was negative 60 days after initiation of antiviral therapy and the patient was restarted on a lower dose of MMF. After the second negative CMV PCR a week later, MMF dose was increased and valganciclovir was decreased to prophylactic dosing. The patient received valganciclovir for a total of 87 days. The outcome was control of CMV viremia and recovery of cell counts. Graft outcome was stable allograft function. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The author commented, ""There are multiple risk factors linked to CMV viremia and disease in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) and after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These include older age, female sex, blood group A, decreased creatinine clearance, allograft impairment, CMV serostatus prior to transplant (donor seropositive-recipient seronegative OR recipient seropositive), transplantation type, use of T-cell depleted stem cell grafts, use of anti-thymocyte globulin before transplant, and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Vaccination has not been previously reported as a risk factor for CMV viremia. There is a paucity of data on the effects of influenza vaccination leading to viremia in solid organ transplant recipients. Thus, we reviewed the data available in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, another subset of immunocompromised patients. The research on the effect of influenza virus on HIV replication has produced conflicting results. Some studies have shown that influenza vaccination results in increased HIV replication (and subsequently increased viremia) in patients with uncontrolled or partially controlled viral replication. Other studies have shown that vaccination did not result in increased HIV replication. In some transplant recipients, influenza-like illness has been reported after vaccination. SOTRs are maintained in a state of prolonged immunosuppression after transplant. Thus, there is a possibility that influenza vaccination may lead to transient increase in CMV viral load and subsequent viremia (similar to the transient viremia seen in HIV patients). Both patients had a temporal association of onset of CMV viremia with administration of the influenza vaccine. They were older females at high risk of CMV reactivation (donor CMV seropositive/recipient CMV seronegative). Second Patient was on CMV prophylaxis, while second patient was not receiving valganciclovir (per our institutional protocol of CMV prophylaxis until six months post-transplant). They reported compliance with their home medications, with no recent increases in their maintenance immunosuppression. First Patient had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection, while second patient had an upper respiratory bacterial infection in the preceding months - these resolved completely with appropriate therapy. They had no concurrent inflammatory disease processes at the time of vaccination. Lab testing demonstrated high CMV DNA levels with concomitant leukopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. There were no additional factors identified to have contributed to CMV viremia. The CMV viremia was severe enough to warrant therapeutic antiviral therapy and changes in their immunosuppression regimen. We thus believe that CMV viremia resulted from the prior vaccination in our patients. One meta-analysis concluded that the influenza vaccine was associated with statistically significant protection against influenza-like illness in immunocompromised patients, including SOTRs. Through this case report, we wish to highlight the finding of CMV viremia occurring after influenza vaccination, with no other identified triggers. Further research and accumulation of cases is needed to investigate the strength of this association, to determine the mechanisms that resulted in CMV viremia and to recognize the risk factors leading to progression from viremia to clinically relevant CMV disease."" The author concluded, ""Vaccination may lead to transient viral replication in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-infected patients (likely due to genetic and immune-mediated mechanisms). Similarly, we believe that influenza vaccination led to transient CMV viremia and CMV disease in our renal transplant recipients on potent immunosuppressive therapies. Further research is needed to assess the strength of this correlation, the mechanisms causing viremia and the risk of progression to clinical disease. Until then, clinicians must continue vaccination of SOTRs per the guidelines, but must also remember to enquire about recent vaccination when evaluating SOTRs with new onset CMV viremia.""

The patient's past medical history included amblyopia and ophthalmic herpes zoster (left-sided 20 years ago but was unable to provide documentation of her clinical presentation). Previously administered products included Shingrix (1st dose received on an unspecified date). Concurrent medical conditions included corneal decompensation (chronic in the eye secondary to forceps injury at birth).   On an unknown date, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingrix. On an unknown date, 1 week after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced ophthalmic herpes zoster (serious criteria GSK medically significant), keratitis, eye ulcer, pain, photophobia, corneal thinning and corneal edema. The patient was treated with valaciclovir hydrochloride (Valacyclovir), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Moxifloxacin), ciprofloxacin (Ciprofloxacine) and erythromycin. On an unknown date, the outcome of the ophthalmic herpes zoster, keratitis, eye ulcer, pain, photophobia, corneal thinning and corneal edema were Recovered/Resolved.   The reporter considered the ophthalmic herpes zoster, keratitis, eye ulcer, pain, photophobia, corneal thinning and corneal edema to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Herpes Zoster ophthalmicus reactivation in a 78-years old female patient, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.  The patient had a history of amblyopia and chronic corneal decompensation in this eye secondary to forceps injury at birth. The patient also had a history of left-sided Herpes Zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) 20 years ago but was unable to provide documentation of her clinical presentation. No information on patient's family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received 2 doses of Shingrix (administration route and site unspecified; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date, a week after second dose of Shingrix, the patient reported pain and photophobia that started 1 month before presentation. The patient was referred for progressive in her left eye. The patient had been prescribed erythromycin ointment and ciprofloxacin drops by her outside ophthalmologist without improvement. Visual acuity was counting fingers at 3 ft in the affected eye, and intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg. Corneal sensation was markedly reduced relative to the contralateral eye. On slit lamp examination, the patient's cornea had a temporal paracentral epithelial defect 1.5x2.0 mm in size with 40% thinning of the underlying stroma. Stromal inflammation was noted around the area of thinning, suggestive of necrotizing stromal keratitis. The surrounding cornea was diffusely edematous. The anterior chamber was quiet. Dilated fundus examination was normal. The right eye had 20/20 visual acuity and unremarkable examination. Given the timing of events, recurrent HZO keratitis after Shingrix vaccination was considered the most probable diagnosis. Other differential diagnoses included a neurotrophic ulcer and a metaherpetic ulcer. The patient was started on oral valacyclovir 1000 mg 3 times daily, topical erythromycin ointment every 4 hours, and hourly preservative-free artificial tears. Three days later, the epithelial defect and thinning persisted. A bandage contact lens was placed, and the patient was started on topical moxifloxacin drops 4 times a day. At 1 week, the bandage contact lens was replaced with self-retained cryopreserved amniotic membrane ring (Prokera; Bio-Tissue) to promote epithelialization. One week later, the Prokera ring was removed. The thinned area had epithelialized with no evidence of further stromal melt. Two months after presentation, the patient reported no new recurrences, and her examination appeared stable. The author commented, ""Although risk of HZO reactivation after Shingrix is likely exceedingly low, clinicians should report such rare AEs to improve understanding of which patients are at greatest risk. Histopathological studies have demonstrated persistence of VZV DNA in the human cornea up to 8 years after clinical onset of HZO, suggesting that the virus can reside in the corneal stroma and precipitate recurrent HZO in some patients. In the case of HZO reactivation after vaccination, an increase in cell-mediated immunity can trigger an immune response to VZV in the stroma, leading to stromal keratitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has no specific guidelines regarding vaccination in patients with previous HZO. Vaccination among age-eligible patients with previous HZO is encouraged unless the patient is having an active episode or flare-up. Once the infection is resolved, there is no specific wait time until vaccination is considered safe. In contrast, antivirals can be continued after Shingrix because the vaccine contains a glycoprotein and not an attenuated live virus, warranting further investigation for its role in preventing HZ in others locations in these patients. Limitations of this case include lack of microbiological testing, including cultures and PCR, to confirm the diagnosis of HZO. In addition, the clinical manifestation of the initial HZO is unknown due to missing previous records."" The author concluded, ""HZO reactivation after recombinant zoster vaccination is uncommon but possible. Ophthalmologists should remain aware of potential risks of zoster vaccination and take special precautions in patients with HZO history.",,,,,,,,,Y,,,,"Test Name: fundus examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: intraocular pressure; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:15,Unit:mm Hg); Test Name: slit lamp examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Visual acuity; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Comments: On an unspecified date, Lab test were performed.Visual acuity was counting fingers at 3 ft in the affected eye.Corneal sensation was markedly reduced relative to the contralateral eye.On slit lamp examination, the patient's cornea had a temporal paracentral epithelial defect 1.5x2.0 mm in size with 40% thinning of the underlying stroma.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 21Sep2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 73-year-old female patient of an unspecified age received pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) (PREVNAR 13, NDC: 0005-1971-01), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Sep2020 at 0.5 ml single (half a milliliter prefilled syringe) for pneumonia vaccine. Medical history included nickel: allergies, lead: allergies from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took formaldehyde, phenols, quaternium-15, zinc and experienced allergies. She has never received a pneumonia vaccine but had a terrible reaction to the flu vaccine influenza vaccine (FLUZONE) because of the 5 micrograms of formaldehyde per 0.5 ml sample. The patient experienced started itching a lot/scratching everywhere, mainly her arms/ her legs itch, her feet, and the soles of her feet./ mostly in her hands, arms, and upper legs, feeling chills both on 20Sep2020, couldn't go back to sleep on an unspecified date. Caller received the pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) injection yesterday afternoon. She didn't know for sure but she started having a reaction. She had never had this reaction to anything. She started itching a lot. The itching wasn't too horrible being awake, but once she went to bed it was worse. Within in an hour she woke up scratching everywhere, mainly her arms. She even had little cuts from scratching. She got up and took a hot bath too. She also was feeling chills. She was cold and itched. That was why she thought getting in the hot bath would help. She also tried taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She thought maybe it would help. It wasn't as bad after that, but she couldn't go back to sleep. She would try to lie down, but she would scratch. She was up most of the night. She doesn't know. She was still feeling itchy. When she was awake the itching was not so horrible. It was like it was coming from the inside and coming out of her. Her legs itch, her feet, and the soles of her feet. She did have a lot of allergies. She did call and check with Pfizer before getting this to make sure it didn't have Formaldehyde, Quaternium-15, or phenols in it. They are her worst allergies. It didn't have those in it so she decided to get it. She didn't know what it could be. There may be another allergy she was not aware of. She was a chemist until she retired, and she had some strange allergies. She has never had this type of reaction with her other allergies. Usually those are breathing allergies. The itching and chills started an hour after the vaccine. It had improved some. Now it was mostly in her hands, arms, and upper legs, before it was everywhere. After the bath, she had a cream that was from Dermatologist a while ago. It was Triamtinolone acetonide steroid cream 0.1%, she used that as well. She put that on the places that were itching. When she would put that on, she could finally go back to sleep. She received the vaccine at pharmacy. When she checked to get information originally to be able to get it, they gave her a paper then. She doesn't know if it was the same lot of what she actually got. The lot wasn't listed on her papers. She has never had a pneumonia shot. She hadn't been able to take flu shots in recent years, but she was told this particular flu shot called fluconazole (FLUCOMAX) she could get. She took that 3 weeks ago. Someone told her when she got that shoot that one of the Pneumonia shots didn't have what she was allergic to. It was pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein). She called Pfizer to find out if the things she is allergic to were in it, and they were not. She did her research on it. She had never had a Pneumonia shot. She has had some itching in her hands before this, but nothing like this. The hands were giving her a little trouble before. She had been using that steroid cream periodically. She cannot determine what she was allergic to sometimes. She is allergic to liquid hand soaps. She hoped it quits. This was not one of her normal reactions. Her hands did this odd thing again with the itching. The itching was everywhere. It feels like the nerves are at the edge of her skin. The doctor said she shouldn't take anything like this. So he doesn't know she got it.

A 74-year-old female patient received pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) (PREVNAR 13), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on an unspecified date of 2020 at single dose for getting older/pneumonia vaccine. Medical history included ongoing osteoporosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient went in to get the pneumonia vaccine because she was older and the doctor wanted her to get one. She reported had a terrible reaction that has changed her life. Then she was on prednisone for who knows how long. The reason for the call was that she was looking for any information on this reaction occurring and to find out a list of ingredients for the product. She was not sure the date the product was administered but thought the shot was given in either the latter part of Aug2020 or early Sep2020. A couple hours later her left arm was really sore and really hurt but she thought it was like a tenuis shot, how that hurts. Then she got the same pain on the other arm where she got no shot and the pain began to spread throughout both biceps. The next day, there was pain in her upper legs. The pain was there when she woke up every morning and the pain was worse every day. It got to the point she could not even lift her arms. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL), trying this for a couple day and it would made it, after about 1.5 hours, where she could get out of bed and move her arms. She finally called the doctor and was told that the doctor would give her prednisone but wanted her to get lab work first. The weekend came and she went to urgent care where she was given a methylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPAK). The caller informed her doctor who instructed her that was fine but she was to go to the ER and get labs done. After the lab work came back, she was told it was ok to get the prednisone and use it. Within 7 hours of starting the product, the pain was better and by day 6 the pain was gone so she stopped the product. Then 2 weeks later the pain came back and got worse. She went to a rheumatologist who put her back on the prednisone, she was taking 15mg. The doctor tried to taper her off and she got down to 1 prednisone pill. When she went to a new rheumatologist she was told to stop in 3 days, the prednisone but after stopping, within 3 days the pain came back. Now she is living on prednisone and can't function without it. she had been going through test to figure out what was causing this but it all started with this pneumonia vaccine, she was fine before. The caller was looking for information on the ingredients and if this information was available to the public. She had done research online and found other people have had issues. The caller explained she had no information on these patients specifically nor did she have and product details such as NDC, Lot, or Expiry for product used. The problem was that she had severe osteoporosis and prednisone makes bones more brittle. That was why she seeing a rheumatologist, for the osteoporosis. The prednisone is in a pharmacy bottle. Unknown number on the bottle: 54502. She had a lot of test done and they were still coming in, for inflammation since that was what the doctors are saying is the problem. She got some last week and some were coming in. The doctors explained to her that her muscles were inflamed. She was supposed to see the rheumatologist at the end of the week for the interpretation of what he thought was going on. The caller also stated she hadn't gotten a flu shot.

0885859,09/25/2020,,20.0,,,F,,"Premature delivery at 36.4 weeks of gestation; Herpes type 2; Vaccine exposure during pregnancy; Acid reflux; This is an observational study case, received on 07-Aug-2019 from other health professional and concerned a 20-year-old, pregnant, female subject of body weight 97 lbs, height 60 inches and body mass index (BMI) 18.9, enrolled in, a prospective observational safety study.   The subject's past medical history included bacterial vaginosis (from 07-Sep-2018 to 16-Sep-2018). The subject's concurrent condition included muscle spasms. The subject's concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (mineral nos, vitamins nos) for pregnancy, Metrogel (metronidazole) for bacterial vaginosis and ciclopirox for muscle spasms.   The subject's obstetrical history noted that the subject had no previous pregnancies. The subject did not have a history of offspring with major congenital malformations (MCMs). Also, the subject had no maternal or paternal history with MCMs. The subject did not use alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The subject used cigarettes during pregnancy (one pack per day).   The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 01-Mar-2018. Estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) were reported as 06-Dec-2018. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 30-Aug-2018, spinal muscular atrophy test and cystic fibrosis mutation analysis revealed no MCMs.   On 10-Sep-2018, ultrasound revealed no MCM.   On 08-Oct-2018, at gestational age of 31 weeks (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Flucelvax QIVc (Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD) [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as �vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was 252664.   On the same day, after receiving Flucelvax QIVc, the subject developed acid reflux and started treatment with Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride), at a dose of one tablet administered via oral route, once per day.   On 22-Oct-2018, a toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and HIV (TORCH) panel test and ultrasound revealed no MCMs.    On 26-Oct-2018, 18 days after vaccination, the subject developed herpes type 2. It was not reported whether the subject received any corrective treatment for the event.  On 30-Oct-2018, ultrasound revealed no MCM.   On 11-Nov-2018, at gestational age of 36.4 weeks (as reported), the subject vaginally delivered live birth, male neonate. The neonate's birth weight was 2041 g, head circumference and length were not reported. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes). APGAR score was not reported for 10 minutes. No major congenital malformation was identified at birth.  On 07-Aug-2019, the subject completed the study and the registry was closed as no additional information was expected.   At the time of follow up reporting on 17-Sep-2020, the subject had not recovered from the events of acid reflux and �herpes simplex type II'.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.   The event of �premature delivery' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked to 201904364, the corresponding child report.  Non-significant additional information received on 04-Sep-2019 from other health professional: It was confirmed that the events 'herpes simplex' and 'acid reflux' were still ongoing. No change in the narrative.  Additonal information received on 17-Sep-2020 from other health professional: The subject's age was updated from 21 to 20 years. Fetal outcome changed from normal to perinatal complication in pregnancy information. Six laboratory tests coded in laboratory data. Concomitant medications details updated. The event of �premature delivery' was marked as medically significant and the case was upgraded to serious. Stop date added for the events of �premature delivery' and �vaccine exposure during pregnancy'. Outcome changed from �not reported' to �resolved' for �vaccine exposure during pregnancy'. Date of study completion was provided. number removed as reference number. The narrative was amended accordingly.  Company comment: The patient experienced herpes simplex type II 18 days after vaccination and premature delivery 1 month 3 days after vaccination with Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD. The patient also developed gastroesophageal reflux disease on the same day after vaccination with the suspect product, administered at 31 weeks of gestation. Chronology is plausible. Although causality for gastroesophageal reflux disease was highly confounded by pregnancy, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as unlikely related. (defaults to ""related"" in the safety database for reporting purposes). The patient's medical history of muscle spasms, and especially tobacco use may have contributed to the event of premature delivery. Causality is assessed as not related. For the event of herpes simplex type II, causality is assessed as not related due to biological implausibility. Vaccine exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related per company's conventions.; Sender's Comments: The patient experienced herpes simplex type II 18 days after vaccination and premature delivery 1 month 3 days after vaccination with Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD.

He came to the ED 9/20/2020 and wanted to be discharged home with pain medications and close monitoring, of which he was able to walk with a walker. The patient was admitted to Hospital on 9/21/2020 with sudden onset leg weakness and numbness in the hands. The numbness was involving the inner surface of the hands and slightly in the forearm.  He did not think he is weak in the arms.  He denied any recent trauma.  He had a fall a few days ago, bruising his knees- after the onset of leg weakness. The patient also complained of a transient episode of severe leg and low back pain that started 9/20/2020 and resolved with narcotics. He also complained of a two day history of severe neck pain, radiating to the back of the head, and between the scapular region. The pain was sudden in onset and it spontaneously resolved.

0885933,09/26/2020,NE,84.0,84,,F,,"My mom, age 84, is currently hospitalized for a thoracic surgery to drain fluid from her right lung. This is related to having a chronic heart condition, including a mechanical mitral valve, but she is still active at her age.  She does live on her own in her own home and does the bookkeeping/ bill-paying so she is still living an active life.  She admitted to the hospital last week on Wednesday Sept 16, 2020. Her surgery took place on Sept. 17.  The night before, on the 16th, she was given a flu shot which I was told was made by  Glaxo Smith Kline ""Fluzone Quad"" lot B7473  MDC 58160-885-41  exp 6/30/21.  I believe this may be a stronger quad vaccine, using recombinent DNA, with three or four times more hemagglutinin antigen versus standard dose quad activated vaccine, with more reports of adverse reactions in the elderly than normal.  One of my mom?s nurses said her own mother was sick for a day and half after getting her flu shot recently. My mom?s reaction has been severely swollen and black and blue arm including her hand. She complained of pain with the arm during the night before her surgery.  Immediately after her thoracic surgery, her first complaint was the pain in her ?flu shot arm.? She complained she never slept the night of her flu shot due to pain. She complained of headache, back ache, fatigue and weakness. The surgery outcome was bad and she required it to be redone which occurred on 9/24/2020.  I became very concerned when I showed pictures of my mom?s arm to a co-worker (also a nurse) who said her dad?s arm looked just like that after he got a flu shot.  He then started to have fever, weakness, change in level of consciousness and was dead in 2 weeks. Allergy to flu shot was listed as cause of death on his death certificate.  He was doing well before that.  My mom is on chronic blood thinners (coumadin at home and heparin now in the hospital) which the hospital is citing as the reason for the bruising to her arm-- but that does not explain the swelling, pain and other symptoms. The bruising is excessive and not something ever experienced before when she did NOT have a flu shot while on heparin.  She has never had a reaction like this to the flu shot before. I feel her immune response may very well have affected the surgical outcome in which she was left with a full liter of gelatin like blood in the region of the lungs, requiring a second surgery.  My mother only took the shot because it was suggested by the hospital.  I feel this product should NOT be recommended for use immediately prior to surgery.  My mother was seen by a vascular surgeon as a result of the large, hard hematoma to the vaccination injection site. The arm was needed for lab work and IVs (other arm is post mastectomy from many years ago)  but ultimately the flu shot arm could not be used due to compromised condition. It remains darkly bruised from shoulder to finger tips, wrapped with a pressure dressing, swollen and painful. My mother's hemoglobin fell dramatically, at least partially related to this arm, and her ultimate outcome is still uncertain.",,,,,,,Y,,N,09/16/2020,09/16/2020,0,MRI done of arm,PVT,,"Lasix, Ramapril, Lovenox, tylenol, zolpidem, benedryl",In hospital to treat pleural effusion.,"Mechanical mitral heart valve,  atrial fib/pacemaker, hypertension",,,2,09/26/2020,,,,Sulfa

Neurology was then consulted and recommended treating with high dose steroids as well as IVIG due to severity of illness. He was also given diazepam for comfort due to increasing rigidity and Parkinsonian symptoms. Due to multiple bug bites and inability to rule out tick exposure at the lake, doxycycline was started on admission, but was discontinued on 9/18 as ADEM was deemed to be the most likely cause of his symptoms and he started having bradycardia with occasional dropped beats.

Pain in back is better (1or2 out of 10); headaches less consistent but still bothersome (3-5 but not constant). The reason I write is that this is day 7 since my Friday morning flu shot, and my temp is going in the wrong direction. 100.2 a few hours ago. 100.3 a few minutes ago. Likely due to temp, overall fatigue, malaise, eyes burning a little. I will take some tylenol. My big question is whether I should do more/different.

A 65-years-old female patient received pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) (PREVNAR 13), intramuscular on 20May2019 at single dose in a low part of her right arm for immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing mild asthma, allergies to all kinds of trees and dogs and rodents, and two kinds of dust mites, and everything but cats since 2003, a cough and scratchy throat and her eyes would get affected, sick with the sinus issues, fatigue. Historical Vaccine included flu shot. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had developed a lipoma on her arm at the injection site of a pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) injection that was also described as a severe swelling the size of half of a golf ball and her skin felt harder in that area, about 4 months ago she noticed that the area around the lipoma had a yellowish old bruise-like color. The patient had bruise-like discoloration of the skin in the site of administration as a side effect for receiving pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein), she believed that she received the vaccine inappropriately in a low part of her right arm. Caller states that the nurse who gave it to her, gave it lower than the caller would have given it. She had several allergies, the fact that this lipoma did not go away made her depressed. Her physician told her that this might be a reaction to the preservatives of the vaccine and the patient thought there was a chance she was allergic to one of the preservatives in the vaccine. She also wanted to know if this lipoma was ever going to go away. she is so upset and very disturbed, because it makes her arm look deformed. Caller got the injection, and in about 10 days, she could see that arm, it didn't get red, it just got big like a bulge, and in 10 days she was calling her doctor, and he was seeing her again and said that it looked like a lipoma. Caller states that her doctor told her to give it a month, and so the caller went back in a month, and the caller was sent for an ultrasound and right when she took her jacket off, the doctor said that he could see right away that swelling on her right arm. Caller stated that they ultrasounded her left arm too, to be able to compare the two, and the ultrasound revealed that it was a lipoma and there was no cancer cells at the time. But caller states that what was troublesome, was that she kept hoping it would go down, and go away, but it was like harder tissue. Caller states that she was just so upset and mad at herself. Caller stated that her doctor told her that this was extremely rare, but anything that was rare, the caller got it. Caller stated that humidity affects her, and she has issues from it, but nothing major. Caller stated that she ate organic and did everything good for her heath, and if she had known this would have happened, she would not have gotten it. Caller stated that she did not take flu shots anymore. Caller states that she was not going to get the second pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) shot either. Caller stated that she used to take the flu shot when she was teaching, because she was around kids and was always sick with the sinus issues and strep from the kids. Caller stated that she was much healthier since she retired, cause she had been doing some sub-ing and she had tremendous side effects from going in to those buildings. Caller states that she would test it to try and figure out which buildings bothered her, and she would get a cough and scratchy throat and her eyes would get affected, and she couldn't read a story to the kids before the buses came, so she had to quit that job. Caller confirmed that she had asthma and allergies prior to ever receiving the Prevnar 13 vaccine. Caller stated that her doctors were all relieved when she decided she was done. Caller stated that her doctors said that as she got older, she shouldn't keep pushing it. And caller stated that she was totally (14Sep2020) done with it now, especially with COVID. Caller states that the doctor was going to just give her a pat on the back, and tell her that she is going to have to live with it or have surgery. Caller stated that this whole thing made her upset because she felt there was like no recourse, and she cannot get the bulge to go away. Caller had tried ice and hot packs and nothing works.

The patient's past medical history included endometriosis, chronic kidney disease (received a deceased donor kidney transplant in 1998 that failed in March 2018 and was subsequently on hemodialysis) and upper respiratory tract infection. Previously administered products included anti-inflammatory drug with an associated reaction of chronic kidney disease, anti-thymocyte globulin, methylprednisolone and amoxicillin. Concurrent medical conditions included hypertension. Concomitant products included sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim (Sulfamethoxazole + Trimethoprim) and valganciclovir.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the cytomegalovirus viremia, leukopenia and diarrhea were unknown.   The reporter considered the cytomegalovirus viremia, leukopenia and diarrhea to be related to Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent 2019-2020 season.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of cytomegalovirus viremia in a 62-years old female patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to patient-2 reported in this literature article. The patient had past medical history of endometriosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (likely from anti-inflammatory drug use for management of endometriosis) was being followed in the transplant nephrology clinic. The patient received a deceased donor kidney transplant in 1998 that failed in March 2018 and was subsequently on hemodialysis. The patient received a second renal transplant (re-transplant) from a deceased unrelated donor in June 2019. The Donor CMV status was CMV seropositive and the recipient CMV status was CMV seronegative. Induction immunosuppressive regimen included anti-thymocyte globulin, and methylprednisolone. Recent inflammatory disease processes (allograft rejection, infection) included upper respiratory infection. [The patient had an upper respiratory bacterial infection in the preceding months - these resolved completely with appropriate therapy].  Time period between transplant and inflammatory disease process was 1 month. Treatments for inflammatory disease processes included amoxicillin. Duration of inflammatory disease process was 1 week. The patient had no prior episodes of CMV reactivation. The patient was taking primary CMV prophylaxis. The patient had no recent increase in maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Time period between transplant and presentation was 3 months. No information on patient's family history was provided. On an unspecified date at the end of September 2019, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date, 7 days (a week) after the vaccination, the patient's routine outpatient labs performed, and the patient was noted to have detectable CMV viral levels [4,983 IU/ml (3.70 log10 IU/ml)] without any symptoms. Prophylactic medications at the time of presentation included sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) single-strength (SS) 1 tablet oral (PO) every forty-eight hours (QOD) and Valganciclovir 450 mg every twenty-four hours (QD). The levels continued to rise over the course of two months [214,823 IU/ml (5.33 log10 IU/ml)] [lower limit of assay detection 60 IU/ml (1.78 log10 IU/ml)], with no improvement after switching from valganciclovir 450 mg QD to valganciclovir 900 mg QD. The patient was noted to have worsening leukopenia (WBC 1,260/cubic mm), so the patient was admitted for further management. On admission, the patient reported multiple episodes of non-bloody, foul-smelling diarrhea. The patient denied sick contacts, recent travel, medication changes or medication non-compliance. The patient's home medications consisted of tacrolimus ER 8 mg QD, prednisone 5 mg QD, MMF 1000 mg BID, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim single-strength tablet QOD, valganciclovir 450 mg QD. The patient was hemodynamically stable on examination. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Admission labs revealed WBC count 1,480/cubic mm (ANC 950/cubic mm and lymphocyte count 270/cubic mm [N: 1,000-3,300/cubic mm]), hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl (N: 13-17 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 20 mg/dL [N: 7-23 mg/dL], creatinine 1.53 mg/dl [N: 0.50-1.30 mg/dL], ALP 124 U/l. Chest radiograph revealed clear lungs. BK virus and Parvovirus B19 DNA PCR tests were negative. MMF and valganciclovir was held on admission. Infectious diseases service was consulted and the patient was started on renally-dosed intravenous (IV) ganciclovir (2.5 mg/kg QD) and letermovir 480 mg QD PO. Given the lack of response to outpatient valganciclovir therapy, a sample was sent for CMV resistance testing. With improvement in her creatinine clearance, the ganciclovir dosing was subsequently adjusted. WBC nadir during the hospital stay was 1,450/cubic mm (ANC 780/cubic mm), with subsequent recovery due to intravenous antivirals and one dose of filgrastim. CMV resistance tests revealed the presence of two different populations of virus - wild type and a strain exhibiting resistance at M460V and C603W (two out of seven mutations conferring resistance to ganciclovir). No resistance was noted to cidofovir or foscarnet. The patient was discharged on IV ganciclovir and oral letermovir. The final duration of therapy would be determined by outpatient follow-up with infectious diseases and transplant nephrology. The patient was to continue tacrolimus ER 3 mg QD PO and prednisone 5 mg QD PO at home. The outcome was control of CMV viremia and recovery of cell counts. Graft outcome was stable allograft function. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The author commented, ""There are multiple risk factors linked to CMV viremia and disease in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) and after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These include older age, female sex, blood group A, decreased creatinine clearance, allograft impairment, CMV serostatus prior to transplant (donor seropositive-recipient seronegative OR recipient seropositive), transplantation type, use of T-cell depleted stem cell grafts, use of anti-thymocyte globulin before transplant, and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Vaccination has not been previously reported as a risk factor for CMV viremia. There is a paucity of data on the effects of influenza vaccination leading to viremia in solid organ transplant recipients. Thus, we reviewed the data available in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, another subset of immunocompromised patients. The research on the effect of influenza virus on HIV replication has produced conflicting results. Some studies have shown that influenza vaccination results in increased HIV replication (and subsequently increased viremia) in patients with uncontrolled or partially controlled viral replication. Other studies have shown that vaccination did not result in increased HIV replication. In some transplant recipients, influenza-like illness has been reported after vaccination. SOTRs are maintained in a state of prolonged immunosuppression after transplant. Thus, there is a possibility that influenza vaccination may lead to transient increase in CMV viral load and subsequent viremia (similar to the transient viremia seen in HIV patients). Both patients had a temporal association of onset of CMV viremia with administration of the influenza vaccine. They were older females at high risk of CMV reactivation (donor CMV seropositive/recipient CMV seronegative). Patient 2 was on CMV prophylaxis, while patient 2 was not receiving valganciclovir (per our institutional protocol of CMV prophylaxis until six months post-transplant). They reported compliance with their home medications, with no recent increases in their maintenance immunosuppression. Patient 1 had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection, while patient 2 had an upper respiratory bacterial infection in the preceding months - these resolved completely with appropriate therapy. They had no concurrent inflammatory disease processes at the time of vaccination. Lab testing demonstrated high CMV DNA levels with concomitant leukopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. There were no additional factors identified to have contributed to CMV viremia. The CMV viremia was severe enough to warrant therapeutic antiviral therapy and changes in their immunosuppression regimen. We thus believe that CMV viremia resulted from the prior vaccination in our patients. One meta-analysis concluded that the influenza vaccine was associated with statistically significant protection against influenza-like illness in immunocompromised patients, including SOTRs. Through this case report, we wish to highlight the finding of CMV viremia occurring after influenza vaccination, with no other identified triggers. Further research and accumulation of cases is needed to investigate the strength of this association, to determine the mechanisms that resulted in CMV viremia and to recognize the risk factors leading to progression from viremia to clinically relevant CMV disease."" The author concluded, ""Vaccination may lead to transient viral replication in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-infected patients (likely due to genetic and immune-mediated mechanisms). Similarly, we believe that influenza vaccination led to transient CMV viremia and CMV disease in our renal transplant recipients on potent immunosuppressive therapies. Further research is needed to assess the strength of this correlation, the mechanisms causing viremia and the risk of progression to clinical disease. Until then, clinicians must continue vaccination of SOTRs per the guidelines, but must also remember to enquire about recent vaccination when evaluating SOTRs with new onset CMV viremia.""

No redness or swelling noted on back of arm. Client reports some slight itching but reports she does not like to take Benadryl because of how it makes her feel.  Client was encouraged to follow up with her PCP for further evaluation and possible treatment of redness and swelling. Client reported she would call as soon as she leaves health department.

Two hours after shot, I had SLE rash and redness on my cheeks.  2. Within 4 hours after shot, I had hard, swollen red face tissue like hot frostbite near the SLE rash on my cheek. 3.  Within 24 hours after shot, my entire face was bright red, and my skin was clammy, but my temp stayed 98 F. 4.  I had painful headaches with pressure. 5.   Also within 24 hours, and for 2 days, I was vomiting and could not keep water or food down, and had some diarrhea.  I did NOT have any stomach pain, and had no other flu symptoms. 6.  Third Day after shot:   I woke up with pain in my right thigh that wouldn't go away, with a red rash that has been consistent in the past of x-rayed and diagnosed blood clots.  I again felt clammy and nauseated.  I treated with an extra aspirin, as my primary care was out today, and my Rheumatologist does not have time.  I was reluctant to go to ER for blood clot xray, as taking a chance on the blood clot was less of a threat than contracting COVID-19, given the spike in outbreaks.  Up through the day before the flu shot I had no symptoms and, as mentioned my immune system has been incredibly strong for the past 4 years.  I work full-time, and run 20 miles a week, including the night before the flu shot.  I have not had any of these symptoms for 4 years, before I was put on Plaquenil.  Because of the SLE rash, and red hard tissue 2 hours after the flu shot, and also because of the apparent blood clot, these are all indicators of a SLE flare-up for me that I have not had for 4 years.  Because of this, I believe that SLE, and APS secondary to SLE patients need to be cautioned on the flu virus.   There are about 100,000 SLE patients in this country, and 1/3 have APS secondary to SLE.  If those other SLE patients are not as healthy as I have been, if they have a SLE flare to the 2020/2021 flu vaccine like I did, they may have life-threatening organ damage/failure that would force them to seek ER.  If so, open beds is about nil right now.  Also, those other SLE (with APS) patients may not survive being in the hospital if they contract COVID-19 there.  It is also worth mentioning that I have never had a SLE flare with a flu shot before.

Patient had constant dizziness sometimes characterized by a strong spinning sensation. Patient had the need to urinate frequently.  8 weeks later, on May 14th, 2020 the level of pain increased. Patient had stabbing pain around her ribs and upper abdomen. Patient felt inflammation around her upper abdomen. She went to urgent care that night. 2 days later on May 16th, patient went to the ER because pain was severe and her legs were very week. ER conducted a CT scan, blood test, X-ray; doctors did not find ?anything serious?. After this week patient suffered from insomnia. Patient felt organs were heavy causing discomfort and pain when she laid down. Patient had to sleep sitting up in her bed. Patient had muscle spasms around her abdomen.  On June, patient?s headaches were much stronger. Patient started taking muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, 5 mg - 3 tablets per day) which helped decreasing the upper abdominal pain and headaches; Vitamin B (B-Complex 1 tablet per day) and B-12 (3,000 mcg 1 tablet per day). However, patient still had pain around her ribs.  At the end of July patient?s abdominal pain increased. Patient felt inflammation on her upper abdominal area. She could not stand up straight because of her pain in her abdomen.  Patient saw a Neurologist in late July who ordered an MRI of her thoracic spine; the results were normal. Patient saw a neurologist who specializes in chronic virus infections of the nervous system and virus latency in early August. Doctor prescribed Vitamin D, 2000 IU and Valacyclovir 1 g 3 times per day for 14 days in case the Varicella virus was active due to the vaccine. Doctor ordered blood tests of immune function and virology of varicella while patient was taking Valacyclovir. Tests results were normal.  In September, patient saw another neurologist who ordered another blood tests and MRI of her brain and cervical spine. Results were normal.  Patient started to recover in late September. In late December patient saw another Neurologist who specializes in Neuroimmunology. Doctor indicated that symptoms coincided with a condition called transverse myelitis. He indicated that MRIs might look normal with this condition. The way to identify an inflammation of the spinal cord would be through a lumbar puncture and test the spinal cord fluid.

Even though there was no test that confirmed that this condition was triggered by the vaccine, patient believes the vaccine was the cause of this condition and for this reason wanted to report it. According to Agency, transverse myelitis may be due to an autoimmune reaction to a viral or bacterial infection.
