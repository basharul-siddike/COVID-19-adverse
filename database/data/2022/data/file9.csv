On an unknown date, the mother received Hepatitis B vaccine.   The infant was exposed to Hepatitis B vaccine at an unknown time during the pregnancy.  The infant was diagnosed with congenital anomaly (serious criteria congenital anomaly) and fetal exposure during pregnancy. On an unknown date, the outcome of the congenital anomaly and fetal exposure during pregnancy were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the congenital anomaly to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This retrospective pregnancy case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of congenital anomaly and fetal exposure during pregnancy, in a patient of unspecified age and gender, whose mother was vaccinated with Engerix B(GlaxoSmithKline) before pregnancy for prophylaxis.   The patient mother was a part of study that retrospectively analyzed women enrolled in the HEPLISAV-B clinical trials who had pregnancy documented during trial participation and follow up. In this study, outcomes in women who became pregnant during participation in the clinical development program were evaluated. The last menstrual period (LMP) recorded was compared to timing of last dose of vaccine. [In this study, HEPLISAV-B was evaluated in 11 clinical trials, 7 of which were head-to-head comparisons to Engerix-B. Among pregnant women in both groups (Heplisav-B v/s Engerix B), median age (30.5 versus 31.0), were similar]. The patient mother became pregnant during her participation in clinical development program. No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unknown date, the patient mother received Engerix B (administration route and site unspecified, batch number not provided). 8 days after receiving Engerix B (last active injection), the patient mother had her LMP. The patient was exposed to Engerix B in utero.   On an unspecified date, an unknown period after vaccination exposure in utero, the patient was born via unknown method of delivery. The patient was diagnosed with congenital anomaly. The patient was not a pre-term baby. Additionally, the patient mother was found to be seroprotected (more than 1000 mIU/mL). [In this study, seroprotection was defined as anti-HBs more than or equal to10 mIU/mL. Seroprotection rates were 8/14 at 28 weeks in the Engerix-B arms. In the Engerix-B group, peak anti-HBs levels were more than or equal to 10 IU/L and less than 100 IU/L in 4/19 subjects and more than or equal to 100 in 10/19. 7 in the Engerix-B arms were vaccine non-responders (i.e. peak recorded anti-HBs level less than 10 IU/L)]. The case was considered as serious due to congenital anomaly. Treatment was unknown. Outcome of the event was unknown. The authors concluded ""These data from the clinical development program show HEPLISAV-B in pregnant women to induce higher rates of immunogenicity over a shorter dosing regimen with similar fetal outcomes compared with Engerix-B. These results should be further verified with additional studies or data to confirm the safety and efficacy of HEPLISAV-B in pregnant women"".   Upon internal check following correction has been completed: The event maternal exposure before pregnancy was updated instead of fetal exposure during pregnancy.

She reported that all that she can see on there is that, there was no lot, batch or serial number, just the name of the vaccine. She stated that the vaccine was shipped in the morning and they started giving it around noon and she got hers at three o'clock in the afternoon. She stated this is their facility's second batch, and the first was consumed last week. She stated she made a mistake, and that she should have requested they inject her left arm because she is right handed.  The patient reported that she experienced arm stiff and sore two hours after getting vaccine (17:00). It was tolerable at first, but when she got home, she couldn't raise her right arm. She thought it would just be like the Flu vaccine and tolerable but she couldn't lift her right arm. The farthest she can lift her right arm from her side is 2 inches. She tried putting a cold compress on it but it was not working. She doesn't know if she can take TYLENOL. She would like to know if she can take TYLENOL for the pain since it was the only medication she has. Her supervisor advised her to take Advil, but she only has TYLENOL. She says she does feel better and that she was fine, there was nothing else, just her arm is so sore. She has nothing negative, no other side effect, no redness, just her muscle is stiff in her right arm and it feels sore. She stated maybe if she had taken TYLENOL the night before, but last night or today she didn't have strength to open the bottle it was new and she cannot open it. She stated at least the pain is lesser than last night, she didn't get to sleep last night since it felt heavy and stiff with discomfort. She was supposed to get a mammogram on reporting time, but since she couldn't raise her arm she was trying to reschedule. She is supposed to have a blood test the following day. Therapeutic measures were taken which includes cold compress. Outcome of the event ""arm stiff and sore two hours after getting vaccine, at right arm"" was recovering while outcome of all other events was unknown.

But his question was: if he didn't feel side effects, did it mean the vaccine was not necessarily taking, if no side effects, did it mean it will not be effective? Stated it was just minor, like any other shot. He did not mind participating in this study, for information, since Pfizer may be counting soreness in the arm, but he did not perceive this as a problem.

I was feeling fine after the immunization, drove home and took some Tylenol in case of any arm pain (of which I have had none). I ate some lunch, was on the phone talking with a friend and developed sudden onset of lightheadedness, slurred speech and extreme sleepiness. No other focal deficit.  I actually got up and walked around to try to shake it off.  But I suddenly felt so tired that I could not keep my eyes open.  I called my husband and asked him to come home immediately. I laid down and tried to reassure my kids that I was fine.  I don't remember much thereafter.  Just bits and pieces.   It felt like I was under general anesthesia, trying to wake up but not able to open my eyes or move my arms/legs.  I could hear some things going on but could not talk.  There were times I would ""wake  up"" in my mind and I would check to make sure I could swallow and I was breathing ok.  I remember mumbling to my husband that I could breathe.  He says he was checking my vitals throughout this time and monitoring things.  He said my Blood pressure was initially 80/60, pulse 50,  and as he keep checking it gradually improved.    This lasted about 2 hours and then finally I was able to wake up.  I felt a little lightheaded and tired for the rest of the day,  but I feel essentially normal today.

0913481,12/30/2020,ID,51.0,51,,M,,"Hello- I am a physician and had an unusual (but minor) health event that may or may not be related to the COVID vaccine.  I did discuss this with a Dr. who was previously employed by the CDC and is an expert in vaccines just to be sure I was not injecting irrelevant data to the CDC or Pfizer during what I?m sure has been very busy time.  Dr. advised me to report it just in case my experience is of interest.   I had symptoms that I had never had before ? an acute urticaria with the very typical wheals (hives) reaction 10 days post vaccination (again, have never had this before in any setting and I?m generally not a ?rashy? or ?allergic? person).  I have had no new exposures that I know of and no other symptoms to suggest URI or other infectious etiology.  I understand that this could potentially be be a delayed reaction that can manifest as a rash but I thought that these were more often various morphologic forms of maculopapular eruptions instead of urticarial type reactions.  The area of urticaria was localized and very well demarcated with moderate to intense itching but no other symptoms (no systemic symptoms ? no generalized urticaria; wheezing; swelling of the mouth, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; vomiting; diarrhea; hypotension; decreased level of consciousness; etc.).   I did take a photo of the area just in case they might be helpful and can provide it if requested.  The urticaria lasted for about 12 hours and resolved without intervention (I did not use oral or topical medication)  Anyway, I thought I would report this (after discussion with Dr.) just in case there was interest or if my experience might help identify aspects of the more severe atopy issue with the Pfizer vaccination.  However, I fully understand that acute urticaria has many different etiologies and I will still have the second dose of the vaccine done on schedule (of course will be sure to have appropriate supplies on hand just in case of a reaction).

Within 3-5 mins, reaction started with flushing, shaking of the upper and lower extremities, and feeling weak and faint. After laying down, the shaking and flushing continued and progressed. My teeth started chattering and my jaw and neck started to feel stiff. Was given 50mg of liquid benadryl around 11:20am. Within 20-30 mins, symptoms were improving, but then, symptoms returned (around 20 minutes after the first wave resolved). The symptoms were worse in the second episode, with full body shaking, stiffness of neck, teeth chattering and jaw starting to clench. Became pale and flushed. No difficulty breathing or SOB, although my throat felt a little tight. Had difficulty speaking due to throat / jaw tightness. Unable to stand without assistance due to leg tremors/shaking/weakness.

Took 25mg benadryl as recommended at 4:45pm, ad 500mg Tylenol.   Around 7:45pm (after eating supper), I started to feel a little flushed/faint again, and was visibly pale. Started to have mild throat/neck tightness and slight tremors in hands, but no difficulty breathing or airway swelling. No rash. Took 25 mg Benadryl at 8pm and drank plenty of fluids. Started to experience tingling in both thighs, which later moved to both calves which lasted around 8 hours. No hand or feet tingling. Tingling resolved in the morning by 7am. No leg or arm weakness.

I walked to the bathroom.  I was able to void at that time, but the nausea did not go away.  I crawled to my bed and laid back down.  I then still felt intensely nauseous to the point that I was going to pass out and the room was spinning.  I made it back to the bathroom where I threw bile up in the bathroom.  I still had the urge for a bowel movement but was unable to go ( I imagine I was having a vasovagal response).  I went back to my bed and laid down.  I stayed in bed until my husband came down around 8:30.  He told me to drink some fluids and take another benadryl  with some tylenol.  I did both.  I went back to sleep and I woke up about 2.5 hours later.  I was able to go out of the house to get a few things for Christmas, but then about 6 pm went and laid down for bed for the night.

The patient's medical history included pernicious anemia and She had problems with B12 and Vitamin D like 10 years ago, she had none in her body, everyone said she was deficient and this year with her new primary care, they sent her to do some antibody tests, and found out she has pernicious anemia, allery to MRI and CT contrast. MRI and CT contrast NDC, lot, expiry unknown. Her CT contrast allergy happened when she was 9 and 12 years old. It turns out to be her dad has an allergy the same way, his airways close. Whenever she needs a CT, they do without contrast, if she does need, they prep and give her Benadryl and keep an eye on her. This only happened once, that she needed with contrast, and with prep she was ok. With the MRI, this happened 4 or more years ago, maybe like 5 years ago. She needed an MRI, they said she would be fine, they injected contrast, she felt pretty hot, then she doesn't know, 20 minutes into it, she couldn't handle her gown, she looked at her chest, her whole chest was red like a burn. They gave her the IV Benadryl, she guesses, and it went away, now she knows, she doesn't know if her dad is allergic to MRI dye, but she knows she got the allergy from him for the CT contrast. The concomitant drugs was not reported. The patient was taken to ER with a severe allergic reaction. She had an allergic reaction on 22Dec2020: she passed out, said her brain felt like a rock, like she was there but not there, she then received an Epi Pen shot, when she got to the ER, her throat started to tighten up, lips were tingly and swollen, she was breathing fast, she had chest pain, she scaled it from a scale of 1-10, as about a 3 to 4 for chest pain, she felt nauseous, sweaty, and had a headache. She went to bed last night, and woke up, feeling better but a little fatigued on 23Dec2020. She is wondering if she should take the second dose, and wants to be in the clinical trial for this type of reaction. She needs transfer to Regulatory Authority. Caller confirmed details. Caller states she works in a hospital, and all this happened at the hospital, and her doctor was not involved. Outcome of allergic reaction: asks what does lasting effects mean? Right now she has a little fatigue and headache, but she knows they are regular symptoms she can have with the vaccine, are those lasting effects? She was discharged from the ER to home. She mentioned to the nurse she has, she went to get the shot, she told the registration nurse, she said she has a severe allergic reaction to CT contrast, her airway closes and she has a severe reaction to MRI contrast, her skin burns, it turns red and feels like a horrible burn, she cannot handle anything to contact her skin, it burns, and she mentioned that to the nurse, she said, instead of staying 15 minutes, said to stay 30 minutes there to observe just in case. She got the vaccine, and 10 minutes after the vaccine, she felt a little lightheaded, a little wobbly, but she didn't think much, it was mild, and on the mark at 30 minutes, the nurse asked her to stand, and that is when she started feeling, like her head was so heavy, the only way to describe, was like her brain was like a rock, she had to lay down, and when they laid her down, she wasn't there, she was there but wasn't, and they didn't wait at all to give her the Epi Pen, she had a feeling of heaviness that got worse, she wouldn't open her eyes, she was able to answer questions, but it was not her there, it was weird, then she didn't have. she breathed fast, had palpitations, chest pain, so they called a Rapid Response team, they were keeping an eye on her breathing, which was super fast, and they rushed her to the ED, and the doctor did what they were doing, giving her IV of whatever medication, and she was also very nauseous, then at one point in the ED, she started feeling, like imagine if fists were on throat, pushing her throat, a  little bit, and she tried to tell to the ED doctor, but guessed she was calling everyone to give her things, and didn't catch it, but it didn't last long, at the same time, she started to feel her lips tingly, so she thinks that, because they gave the Epi Pen so quickly, they wasted no time, she didn't have the airways closing like she does when she gets the CT contrast, they were quick. NDC/lot/expiry: She reads from the card they gave her: states first dose COVID-19 EH9899, states it doesn't specify lot, but she can find that out, they just gave her a vaccine record card. EPi Pen: NDC, lot, expiry unknown, states everything happened so quickly, she didn't think to get this information before calling, but she can get it. There at the hospital, she went to see the occupational health doctor, and based on guidelines from the CDC, he read supposedly she cannot get the second dose, but the doctor said because it is so new, and she has to wait the 3 weeks she guesses, things can change, and she wanted to be proactive.

His vital signs notable only for mildly elevated blood pressure but the remainder of his vitals were in the normal range.  At the time of his evaluation his symptoms had fully resolved and he had no ongoing complaints.  I do not think this is an allergic reaction, no evidence of angioedema or anaphylaxis.  Likely vaccine side effect perhaps with some anxiety.  He was offered Benadryl, and further monitoring in the emergency department however his concern is low at the time of his evaluation and he does not feel he needs any treatment or monitoring at this time.  Given his overall reassuring appearance, benign exam, and resolution of his symptoms I agree.  We will have him go home, take 25 mg of Benadryl and closely monitor symptoms.  If he gets any return of his symptoms get back in to the ED for evaluation.  I recommend that he notify the clinic where he received the vaccine about this side effect so that it can be documented.  I do not see any true contraindication to receiving his second vaccine.  He could premedicate with Benadryl prior to his next vaccine.  An alternative option would be to request the Moderna vaccine in place of the Pfizer brand vaccine. 46-year-old male in the ED with concerns about a reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine.

Somewhat rapid onset of symptoms with dizziness, numbness and tingling in his arms and his legs which remained in the distal portions and was not associated with any weakness.  He felt nauseous but without any vomiting.  Developed chills which lasted for a few minutes and then resolved.  He felt like his tongue was swollen but when his wife looked at it it appeared normal for her.  There was no periorbital swelling, lip swelling, facial swelling otherwise.  He did not develop a rash.  His breathing was normal and he did not have any wheezing, shortness of breath.  There is no chest pain or palpitations though he tells me he felt anxious.  He called the on-call nurse line who instructed her to come to the ED.  He has been in the emergency department for about an hour at the time of his evaluation and reports full resolution of symptoms at this time.  The numbness and tingling has fully resolved.

When I woke up on Sunday both my eyes were bloodshot, again did not think much about it, added some visine and went on about my day. Later in the evening they were bloodshot and watery. I called a nurse friend and talk to her she advised me to call my doctor on Monday morning. I also talked to my optometrist and she advised me if not better by Monday to call her and make an appointment for her to look. I called my primary doctor office on Monday morning and spoke to the nurse. She took my symptoms and talked to my doctor. The nurse called me back to let me know that maybe my headache caused my blood pressure to spike making my eyes irritated and watery. My vision on Monday was very foggy so I decided to call my optometrist to have her look. Her diagnosis was Primary iridocyclitis, bilateral.  This is caused from inflammation. She put me on steroids drops every 2 hours and wants me to keep my eyes dilated for at least a week so that the iris does not attach to the lens again. (it had attached but come unattached) she was concerned because my eyes are always healthy. She saw me again today, Tuesday December  22nd. My eyes are responding well to the steroids. She wants me to continue to use the steroids and dilation drops and follow up with her on Monday unless I have any complications. She also talked to Dr. for his advice on it and he also was concerned about it. Dr. said normally it affects one eye, both of my iris in each eye had attached to the lens from the inflammation.

In 2017 (reported as approximately two weeks after the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine was administered), the pt developed a dark rash, which caused such pain that pt could not bear to have anything touching her skin, and which lasted well into the following year, 2018. The pt sought relief, advice, and treatment from doctors. In addition, she presented at the emergency room in search of relief. The pt was diagnosed with shingles by a doctor in 2017. The pt first learned of the link between zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) and injuries such those from which she suffered, in or about 22-DEC-2018, when a friend shared information found on internet. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, the pt's symptoms had resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using the product. The pt also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of her (conflict information, also reported as ""his"") condition. As a result of the manufacture, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and/or sale of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, as a tragic consequence of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt has suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. All damage proximately caused by the aforementioned characteristics of the zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) product that rendered the product unreasonably dangerous, arose from the reasonably anticipated use of the product by the pt. The outcome of the event shingles was not recovered. The causality assessment was considered as related by the lawyer.  The event shingles was considered to be disabling by the lawyer.",,,,,,,,Y,N,08/01/2017,,,,UNK,,,Routine health maintenance,,,US0095075132012USA010187,2,12/31/2020,,Y,Y,

On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with hpv rl1 6 11 16 18 31 33 45 52 58 vlp vaccine (yeast)(GARDASIL 9) for prophylaxis (strength, dose, frequency, route of administration, anatomical location, lot number, and expiration date were not reported).        In approximately 2000 (reported as: for over 20 years), the patient experienced anogenital warts and human papilloma viral (HPV) infection, which came out all over her body. It was reported that only two types of HPV she could possibly have, which were HPV 9 and HPV 11 for the genital worts. It was reported that she was figuring out which category for HPV she was, but the test did not decipher which HPV type she had. According to her doctors, is not important to know which type of cancer (Neoplasm malignant) she had as she received hpv rl1 6 11 16 18 31 33 45 52 58 vlp vaccine (yeast)(GARDASIL 9).  On 22-SEP-2020 (reported as three months ago) (conflicting information also reported as in November 2020), the patient underwent into a non-invasive surgery. It was reported that her body did not respond to anything she did. Also, she went to the emergency room for her issue (ill-defined disorder) and doctors were not helping her and not giving her answers, and they just told her it was just her anxiety; however, she knew it was not the case. It was reported that she only wanted to figure out what had happened to her, as other people who have had the same procedure had posted the same issues she had (captured in # 2012USA013058). It was reported that the patient did not want to experience that again and she felt like they ruined her and were not careful. She stated that it was negligence from the doctor and she still not ok.   At the reporting time, the outcome of surgery was unknown and for anxiety, papilloma viral infection, ill-defined disorder and anogenital warts was reported as not resolved.

Upon internal review Neoplasm malignant was considered medically significant event. Company Causality Assessment: Based on the limited information currently available for this case, a reasonable possibility to suggest a relationship between the GARDASIL 9 vaccine and the reported event of neoplasm malignant cannot be established. Missing information such as subject�s medical history, dates of GARDASIL 9 vaccine administration, detailed clinical course, diagnostic workup results, treatment and outcome is essential for a proper assessment.

The outcome of events lymphangioma and 'perinephric fluid collection' was not reported.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment.  the events lymphangioma and 'perinephric fluid collection' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  The case is linked to 202005981, the corresponding mother case.  Company comment: Lymphangioma and perinephric fluid collection have developed after foetal exposure during pregnancy to the suspect product Afluria QIV. Chronology is plausible. As reported, the foetus' mother's (subject) obstetrical history included one previous pregnancy with one full term live birth. The foetus' mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. Lymphangioma was not noted on the ultrasound three weeks after vaccination. Lymphangioma was revealed by ultrasound after approximately 7 weeks. No significant information regarding the medical history and concomitant medications have been reported. With information presented, causality for the events lymphangioma and perinephric fluid collection cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as possible (defaults to related in the safety database for reporting purposes). Causality for foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related (as per company specific guidelines).; Sender's Comments: Lymphangioma and perinephric fluid collection have developed after foetal exposure during pregnancy to the suspect product Afluria QIV.

EMS at the vaccine site performed a field EKG which the patient observed to have isolated PVCs. They then obtained a full EKG that again showed isolated PVCs. At this time the patient's blood pressure was taken and recorded to be elevated at 160/110. This caused the patient concern as she has no prior cardiac history or history of hypertension. Patient notes her systolic pressure at baseline is usually 110-120.

It started with tingling/numbness in my right hand which progressed up my arm into my elbow. About 10 minutes later, it then progressed into my right foot, and my left foot. About 10 minutes after that, I started to get flushed and a neck rash (diagnosed from Dr.). I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen 800mg PO every 6 hours for the next 24 hours. The numbness in my right foot and left foot along with the flushness went away a couple hours later. Although, the numbness in my right hand never went away. It came and went for the next 4 days until December 27th and 28th when it started getting worse. On December 28th evening, it got so bad that I was debating going to the emergency room around 1 am. The numbness and tingling was in my right hand and started shooting up my arm. The nerve pain around my wrist was unbearable. I finally fell asleep and the next morning, it was not nearly as bad, but was still there.

He did a full evaluation and found that I had neuropathic pain in my right hand and right foot. As of the 29th, the numbness and tingling was back to my right foot also and would come and go. He gave me a shot of decadron 1g (even though it would blunt my antibody titer response to the vaccine) and gave me extended release gabapentin to start on the evening of the 29th. He also had me start a Medrol dose pack starting on the 30th (today).   12-30-2020 Dr. did a STAT EMG which came back fairly normal. He can almost definitively say this is not guillain barre although he still concerned about some of the more rare de-myelinating brain disorders caused from vaccines. he said the most likely on the differential is a small fiber peripheral neuropathy stimulated from the lipid moiety that encompasses the messenger RNA of the mRNA vaccine.

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19  vaccine was administered at: Time: 0852 Date: 12/31/2020  Patient presented with symptoms at time 0905 while being observed following vaccine.  Patient's symptoms include the following:  Skin and Mucosal symptoms: No  Respiratory Symptoms: Yes: Sensation of throat closing.  If described on scale of 1-10 with throat closure being a 10, stated ""throat closure could feel like a 2-3 on 1-10 scale.  Symptoms also described as ""scratchy throat"". She hadn't had any breakfast today.    She reported history of reaction after pneumococcal ppsv 23 vaccine which consisted of very red, sore, swollen arm with fever following vaccine.  Reported to healthcare provider who let her know she ""suffered an allergic reaction to one or more components of the pneumococcal vaccine and not just side effects"".  She was treated with ibuprofen, ice, and advised to take zyrtec, allegra, or benadryl.  She reports she took benadryl and never required any epinephrine.  She denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, mouth, or throat with that reaction.    She does report a possible reaction to bees/wasps for which she felt previous tingling in the lips, but when reviewed with her PCP, they opted to not order epi pen for her use at the time.  She denies ever needing epinephrine or epi pen use in the past that she is aware of.   Gastrointestinal Symptoms: No  Cardiovascular: Yes: Dizziness  The following actions were performed: Patient was brought to exam room to lie down Feet were elevated Given some water  Given some juice Vital signs: @0915 BP 130/85, Pulse 84, Oxygen on room air 100%, Temp 98.8 F, @0923 BP 126/85, Pulse 75, Oxygen on room air 100%  Airway, Breathing, Circulation, and level of consciousness assessed and normal Bendaryl 50mg administered as a single dose   Patient reported dizziness was resolved quickly after lying down.

Airway, Breathing, Circulation normal throughout assessment period.  Vital signs again checked at 0945:  BP 135/85, Pulse 80, Oxygen 100%, Temp. 98.9 F.  Discussed normal adverse events following this vaccine with patient.  Also discussed more severe adverse events which can include difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat, fast heartbeat, bad rash all over body, and dizziness or weakness.  Discussed she could take another dose of benadryl if she was concerned about any continued, mild swelling of throat in 4-6 hours.   If she has severe swelling of face/throat that is worsening or not resolved with benadryl, she should call 9-1-1 immediately.  She voiced understanding.  We discussed that she would need to weigh the benefits/risks of a 2nd dose, and if she does choose to get a 2nd dose based on a minor reaction not causing severe anaphylaxis, she would need to make sure staff are prepared with benadryl and epinephrine to be used if needed.

I relayed my symptoms to the RN who administered the vaccine and told her I did not feel well enough or safe enough to walk down the hall to the observation room. She got me water, orange juice, and a breakfast bar. I finished the breakfast bar and drank part of the water and orange juice. She told me to stay seated with her for as long as I felt necessary. 15 minutes later, the same RN told me I was ashen pale. She advised me to lie on the floor, which I did with my feet up on a chair. 15-30 minutes later, I told her I felt well enough to walk. She told me to do so and I sat with the person who came with me to receive the vaccine as well. We talked for about 15 minutes when I told her I felt numbness, tingling, and a burning sensation in my throat and the back of my tongue. She got an MD who walked me to another room to quickly examine me. I told her my symptoms and started to experience mild nausea that lasted about 5 minutes. She hooked me up to a machine which revealed 99% O2 sat and heart rate 72. She gave me Pepcid PO. I waited another 30 minutes and told her I felt well enough to leave. As I was driving home, I called the MD who examined me after vaccine administration and reported redness and sores at the back of my throat and back of tongue. I also reported the same burning, tingling, and burning sensation in the back of my throat and back of tongue. She advised me to go to the employee health clinic and be seen by an MD. I arrived at the clinic 15 minutes later. Vital signs were taken with blood pressure in the 140?s systolic, an O2 sat of 100%, and heart rate of 76. The MD who examined me stated this was probably some type of allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid shot IM, Benadryl 25 mg PO and had me stay 90 minutes to be observed after administration. I felt well enough to go home. He told me to take Pepcid PO BID and Benadryl 25 mg q 4-6 hours for the next 1-2 days. He also wrote a prescription for a Medrol Dose Pack to be taken in 2 days if symptoms did not abate. He advised me to go immediately to the ER if I had difficulty breathing where epinephrine could be given. I stated agreement and went home. At home I continued to have sores, redness, tingling, and a burning sensation in my throat and on my tongue as well my head feeling heavy. I also felt muscle soreness and a burning sensation in from my feet to my knees in my legs bilateral. I took the Benadryl and Pepcid as directed and went to bed.  The 2nd day, I still felt the odd burning sensation in my throat and on my tongue as well as the presence of sores in the same area. I also had a heavy feeling in my head, felt woozy intermittently, and had a burning sensation with itchiness on my chin. I picked up the Medrol Dose Pack to have on hand in case I needed. I continued to take the Benadryl and Pepcid as directed by the MD. The 3rd day, the numbness, burning sensation on my tongue and throat is gone but the burning, itching sensation on my chin persists. Sores are still present on the back of my tongue and the back of my throat along with redness. I still have an intermittent feeling of heaviness in my head. I continue to take Pepcid but have stopped taking Benadryl. I have decided not to take the Medrol Dose Pack.

Patient's husband informed her that he noted ""red splotches"" on her back the morning of 12/30/2020 prior to vaccination but didn't think much of it. Her symptoms obviously significantly worsened later that day. However, given that she had atypical symptoms prior to vaccination she is questioning whether this is truly related to the vaccine. She denies any other new exposures prior to symptom onset. No new soaps, lotions, detergents, foods, etc. The only thing she can think of is that in the past she has developed puffiness under her eyes and a runny nose when in the vicinity of marijuana. She inadvertently came in contact with a parcel that likely contained marijuana at work the night before she was vaccinated. Patient denies any previous skin rash due to marijuana exposure but wonders if this could have contributed to her current symptoms.   She denies shortness of breath, wheezing, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or swelling of face/lips. Patient states that other than the diffuse itchy rash, ""I feel fine.""   June does have a history of significant oral swelling and breathing difficulty following bee sting in the past. For this reason, she does carry an EpiPen with her at all times. She has never been evaluated by an allergy specialist but has history of severe reactive airway disease when exposed to perfume. Will refer to allergy specialist for further allergy testing.   Today in clinic, patient was administered 50mg IM Benadryl and she was prescribed famotidine 20mg BID to take at home in addition to Benadryl 25mg TID prn. She felt the witch-hazel provided more relief than the hydrocortisone cream so she will continue this with cool compress or cool showers prn.
