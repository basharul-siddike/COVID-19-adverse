On the same date, he received concomitantly varicella virus vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (manufacturer unknown). The pt claimed that he had suffered the following physical injuries caused by zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX): shingles (herpes zoster) and chickenpox. On approximately 01-OCT-2015 (also reported as three days after getting the vaccine), he first became aware of the injuries as he had blisters and scabs all over his body, had headaches and his whole body hurt and stinger, he also had fever. In October 2015, he was diagnosed with blisters, scabs, fever and pain by a physician who prescribed acyclovir. Pt did not know if a test was ever performed to determine if the rash was wild type or vaccine strain varicella zoster virus. No healthcare professional (HCP) told him he had vaccine strain varicella zoster virus. The pt claimed that receipt of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) caused or aggravated the following psychiatric and/or psychological condition for which treatment was sought from a HCP: anxiety, depression and severe bipolar disorder; which were diagnosed in November 2015 by a physician.

Symptoms included feeling extremely feverish and fatigued, an extremely dry throat and an unproductive cough which which felt like a sore throat mixed in with layrngitis (losing about 95% of my speaking voice), and persistent discomfort and pressure in my eyes. I was not comfortably able to speak for a week and did not retain my speaking voice for 3 weeks.  I remember feeling like these were not mild or typical flu symptoms for me because of the severity of losing my voice, how long it took to fully get my voice back, the dry non-productive cough (vs. a burning sore throat feeling that would normally result from coughing so much), and the general malaise of all the symptoms that I felt for up to 3 weeks. I took 3 days off of work because of how ill I felt and because I could not talk (Thu 10/24, Fri 10/25, and Mon 10/28). Even after coming back to work on 10/29, I felt I probably should have taken at least 2-3 more days off.   Saw my primary care physician on Tue 10/29/19 to discuss my symptoms and obtain a work absence excuse note for having missed previous days (per my employer). No treatment was administered or medications prescribed. His notes indicate: ""discussed typical resolution, warning symptoms reviewed""   Saw the same primary care physician again on Mon 11/11/19 for a physical. I mentioned that in hindsight, I thought these vaccines may have contributed to my falling ill but was told in a very short and muffled response, ""I don't think so"". There was no further conversation in regards to this because his response swayed me based on his position of expertise but also how uncomfortable I felt. However, he did not document this specific inquiry on my appointment notes. I felt later on after my 3 weeks of feeling ill that these vaccines most likely made me ill and that I should have pushed the conversation. The obvious connection between the vaccines and becoming ill two days later is a glaring concern for me.

The patient was 51-year-old at 10-month presentation post vaccination.   The patient's concurrent condition included prolapsing mitral valve. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of shoulder issues and was able to work out and play recreational level sports before the flu shot. The patient was a healthy, fit woman with no significant medial or surgical history.   On an unknown date in Sep-2016, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified, anatomical location: left posterior deltoid, distal and slightly anterior to the posterolateral border of the acromion, also reported high on her left upper arm, dose, route of administration: not reported) for influenza vaccination. The batch number was not reported. The patient likely had the shot administered very deeply, causing mechanical and chemical irritation of the posterior humeral head (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine administered at inappropriate site' and 'Inappropriate route of vaccination').   On an unknown date in 2016, one day after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient developed left shoulder symptoms. The patient later experienced unremitting left shoulder pain and loss of motion.   On 13-Oct-2016, two weeks after receiving flu shot, the patient presented to a primary care sports medicine (PCSM) specialist. On presentation, anteroposterior radiograph of the left shoulder was unremarkable showing no evidence of a lesion in the posterior proximal humerus.   On 08-Nov-2016, two months after the flu shot, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear with a small hyperintense area on the posterior aspect of the rotator cuff footprint.   The differential diagnosis included infection, traumatic injury, or immunologic reactive inflammation. Her shoulder pain was managed conservatively, with a course of anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy.  On an unspecified date in 2016, approximately three months after the flu shot, during the conservative treatment course of anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy, the patient developed adhesive capsulitis. An ultrasound guided joint aspiration was performed and the sample was evaluated for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. Ten aerobic bacterial cultures demonstrated no growth after five days of incubation. Ten anaerobic cultures had no growth after 14 days of incubation. Nine fungal cultures had no growth after four weeks of incubation, and seven cultures for mycobacteria had no growth after eight weeks of incubation. This was treated with two ultrasound-guided intraarticular cortisone steroid injections. Because of the presence of a prolapsing mitral valve, two blood cultures were obtained, which showed no growth. In addition, serologic studies for Lyme disease were negative (both immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)). Studies for rheumatologic disease, including antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and human leukocyte antigen-B27, were also negative.  On an unspecified date in 2017, ten months after the flu shot, the patient's presenting symptoms included anterior and lateral shoulder pain, pain with shoulder flexion and abduction, and night pain. She denied paresthesias, fevers, chills, and night sweats. On presentation to physician's office, she had tenderness to palpation over the anterior fibers of the supraspinatus, with no evidence of muscle wasting. She had normal shoulder range of motion (ROM), with the exception of diminished active abduction (100 degrees on left vs. 170 degrees on right) and internal rotation (5 spinal levels less than the right side). Her strength examination was normal, with the exception of infraspinatus weakness (4/5).  On 12-Jul-2017, ten months after the flu shot and eight months after the initial MRI, a repeat MRI was obtained which demonstrated a significant increase in the signal within the humeral head with bony erosion. Given the change in MRI appearance, she was referred to an infectious disease specialist who recommended rheumatologic blood work (inflammatory markers, metabolic panelsï¿½) and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The lab, including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, were normal.   On 28-Aug-2017, the CT scan demonstrated a large lytic lesion in the posterior proximal humerus. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the bone and soft tissue performed at that time (11 months from the flu shot) was inconclusive.  On an unspecified date in Oct-2017, 13 months after the flu shot, the patient had left shoulder arthroscopy with bone and soft-tissue biopsy and debridement. At the time of arthroscopy, there was evidence of patchy synovitis in the joint with a focal synovitic area at the site of the lytic lesion and a bone defect in the posterior aspect of the humeral head, adjacent to the infraspinatus insertion. Tissue cultures were taken from throughout the anterior capsule, posterior capsule, and synovium. A spinal needle was then used to localize the defect, and an incision was made for insertion of a 7 mm core biopsy needle. The core biopsy was taken from this defect, with debridement of unhealthy-appearing tissue in and at the edges of the defect. Additionally, tissue samples were taken from various locations within the joint. All cultures came back negative. Each location shared inflammatory features of varying degrees. Tissue from the anterior capsule consisted of synovium that showed papillary hypertrophy with a moderate degree of hyperplasia of the synovial lining layer. There was a moderate degree of chronic lymphoplasmacytic inflammation that had a high proportion of plasma cells, some of which contained more than one nucleus. Tissue from the posterior capsule, adjacent to the bone erosion, also showed papillary hypertrophy with greater degrees of hyperplasia and chronic inflammation imparting a much higher degree of cellularity including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and stromal elements. Tissue from the defect in the posterior aspect of the humeral head showed inflammatory destruction of the articular cartilage and bone. The superficial cartilage showed inflammatory destruction of the cartilage with Weichselbaum lacunae and a small amount of pannus. The bony endplate was focally destroyed, and the bone while eroded was demonstrating remodelling activity. The marrow space showed replacement of the fat by dense and loose fibrous and fibromyxoid tissue associated with a variable dense inflammatory infiltrate that was composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, some of which, as elsewhere, contained more than one nucleus.  Once the area of inflammatory tissue was removed and healthy bone/tissue was stimulated at the time of arthroscopy, the patient's body was able to mount a response to heal the injured area. Postoperatively, the patient was placed into a sling for immobilization for two weeks, followed by the initiation of shoulder ROM exercises. Once full ROM was obtained, a supervised shoulder strengthening program was begun.   On an unknown date in 2018, at 1-year follow-up, the patient recovered from all events. She had regained full passive and active ROM in all directions, and strength and functional capacity have returned to normal. No new imaging was obtained given her full functional status with no complaints.  The reporters assessed the events of 'osteolytic lesion', 'shoulder injury related to vaccine administration' and 'adhesive capsulitis' as related to influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. Based on a strong temporal relationship between the influenza vaccination, placed relatively high on her left upper arm, and the onset of patient's left shoulder symptoms the day after the injection, there was a concern that her symptoms were related to the injection.  The events of 'osteolytic lesion', 'shoulder injury related to vaccine administration' and 'adhesive capsulitis' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.   Company comment: A 51-year-old female patient started experiencing symptoms, which will later be determined as osteolysis, shoulder injury (related to vaccine administration) and periarthritis, one day after administration of influenza virus vaccine polyvalent in the area described as: left posterior deltoid, distal and slightly anterior to the posterolateral border of the acromion, also reported as 'high on her left upper arm'.

The patient's past medical history included multiple sclerosis (in remission for ten years). Previously administered products included Shingrix with an associated reaction of injection site pain (1st dose received on unknown date, for tolerance refer case US2020AMR238525).

Additional details were provided as follows: The age at vaccination was not reported, however could be 61 or 62 years. The patient reported she had a significant adverse reaction involving multiple body systems following the 2nd vaccine and would like to discuss it with her physician at their appointment tomorrow. The reporter requested to email the list of ingredients in the vaccine and suspension solution so that they could start discussion about possible remedies. Upon follow received on 1st December 2020 it was reported that the patient had medical history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and had been in remission for ten years. The patient stated that she was immune compromised (because of the multiple sclerosis) but was not taking any immunosuppressant medications. She had gluten sensitivity and had eliminated soy, corn, and dairy from her diet. The patient was a massage therapist for 20 years. The concomitant medications included Naturethyroid, thyroid medication made for the patient by compounding pharmacy using veggie caps. The compounding pharmacy also made the patient Naltrexone low dose 4.5 mg oral (capsules). She took 1 each night and had been taking this since 2013 for her multiple sclerosis and has not had an multiple sclerosis flare in the 7 years since she has been on this product. The patient said that she could not walk 12 hours after the 2nd shot. Around 1 am she got up to go pee and had wicked vertigo. She grabbed onto the door (to stabilizer herself) and urinated quite a bit into the toilet. She said she had to hold onto the wall and dresser so she could walk. As she was trying to walk to the kitchen, to get a glass of water, she could not move her legs. She had to pick up her thigh (with her arms) to move her legs until she got to kitchen sink to get a glass water. Then she had to urinate again and peed on the kitchen floor. The patient's muscles were so weak she could not stand without assistance. She was able to reach a stool and rested on the stool for about 15 minutes. She was not able to properly clean herself or the floor. She said she was afraid because of this episode and was ready to call 911 because she lived alone. The patient eventually made it back to bed without the glass of water. From 13th November 2020 to 25th November 2020, the patient had gastrointestinal upset. She said it was not really diarrhea it was more like an oozing 24 hours a day 7 days a week every time she bent over. She went through many (urinary/sanitary) pads and took Pepto Bismol for 2 days. She would take Pepto each time after having an ooze. The patient had no solid stools during this time and said the Pepto caused her stool to be black. The patient also reported experiencing double vision. The patient was asked her how she was feeling on the day of reporting, if her symptoms had resolved and the patient said that she still had myalgia. She said she still had a lack of muscle strength and lack of energy. Those symptoms were not resolving. The patient said that her stool was no longer black now that she was off of Pepto. She was not having the 24/7 oozing anymore but she still was having some lower digestive issues and she can feel it in her descending and sigmoid colon. The patient said that her descending and sigmoid colon are making themselves known. The patient also said that she was still having urinary urgency issues which was perplexing to her.

I have no allergies and have never experienced an adverse reaction to vaccines, medications, food, or health care products (such as lotion, body wash, etc.).   11/15/2020-11/16/2020: Within the first 6-12 hours, the hives began to spread to my entire body. I took one dose of Benadryl about every 4-6 hours for the first 24 hours, starting at 5:00 am when the hives were discovered on 11/15/2020. Benadryl did not provide relief. I also used calamine lotion on affected areas for the first 24 hours to calm itching.   11/16/2020: I visited my dermatologist (who I have visited before for acne but no other skin issues) at 3:15 pm who confirmed hives but could not confirm the specific cause. I provided information on the vaccine that I received (as that was the only ?new thing? that I had taken or began using  within the last few months). He instructed me to keep a detailed journal and monitor flare-ups, as well as change detergent, not use fragrances (in health care products or home products, such as Glade Plug-ins), and monitor foods that commonly cause reactions in individuals (such as strawberries). He prescribed Triamcinolone 0.1% Cream. I was also instructed to take Zyrtec 10 mg instead of Benadryl (since I was seeing no relief). He also provided the option to take Pepcid 20 mg with the Zyrtec. I began using Triamcinolone 0.1% Cream on patches of hives that night at around 6:00 pm and took a Claritin 10 mg tablet with the Pepcid 20 mg.   11/15/2020-11/17/2020: Hives covered extremities and most of body the first 48 hours after discovery. They were large patches (about 8-10 inches grouped together) and were painful, itchy welts. They moved frequently around my body and would disappear and reappear in different areas every 1-2 hours. I noticed that the hives would flare sporadically and appear in unusual places (such as tops of feet and neck), but specifically on ?touch points? (example: sitting on the couch or in the car would cause large welts on my back, butt, back of legs, and back of arms). I limited showers and would only use cool water with Aveeno fragrance-free body wash. I also kept my skin moisturized with Aveeno and CeraVe, and wore loose clothing. No pain relievers such as Advil or Tylenol were taken.  11/17/2020: Continued use of Triamcinolone 0.1% Cream and Claritin 10 mg with Pepcid 20 mg.  11/18/2020: Discontinued Triamcinolone 0.1% Cream (hives were frequently moving and I did not want to continue reapplying cream if the hives disappeared and reappeared in the same area); I also saw no relief from the cream since I began using it. I saw a good amount of improvement that morning from the Claritin and Pepcid taken over the last 48 hours; the patches were still present but they no longer covered my entire body.   11/18/2020-Present: I have continued to take Claritin 10 mg. On 12/2/2020 I discontinued the Pepcid 20 mg as it specifies on box not to take for more than 14 days. The hives have not gone away permanently, but they have improved since 11/18/2020. They continue to appear on my stomach, arms, legs, back, and butt, either in large patches or small spots that are grouped somewhat close together. It is rare that they appear on multiple areas of my body, but it has happened (for example: the night of 12/8/2020, they were on my arms, back, and butt after sitting on the couch for a few minutes). I work from home due to COVID and do not typically notice any hives during the day while I work at my desk and move around, but I tend to wake up with them in one or two areas and go to sleep with them in one or two areas. To be on the safe side, I have changed to a fragrance-free detergent and I continue to use fragrance-free body products. I have tried to keep somewhat of a detailed journal with photographs, and have found no correlation between the hives/flare ups and any food or products that I have used. I have had no other symptoms or health issues since first discovering them on 11/15/2020. I have also not taken any pain relievers, such as Advil or Tylenol, since discovering them. I'm a fairly active person but have not exercised or exerted myself much since discovering them; I only go on short walks when the weather is cool (I do not see flareups from the walks).",,,,,,,,,N,11/10/2020,11/15/2020,5,None,PHM,,"Tretinoin 0.05% Cream (applied on face, neck, and chest at night)",None,IBS and GERD (diagnosed in 2015); hiatus hernia (found in 2017 after endoscopy),,,2,12/09/2020,,Y,,None

I've had many a flu shot, and none were this painful. I think the young man pharmacist didn't use the proper length needle, because I had the sensation that the needle went right through the muscle and into the bone. It hurt a lot, so much so that I let out an un-ladylike expletive.  Second was the Shingles shot in the right shoulder. I once again had the sensation that the needle went all the way through my muscle and into the bone. It hurt a lot. Later that same evening, I felt nauseous like I wanted to throw up, and I had such excruciating pain in my right shoulder that I was screaming & writhing in pain and the neighbor's dog could hear me [by barking in acknowledgement]. I applied ice and I was finally able to fall asleep. It was better the next morning. However, to this day (today is 12/14/2020 as I write this), my shoulder is not the same. I am not able to reach for things or use my shoulder in certain ways without experiencing pain and discomfort. I don't think the young man pharmacist followed proper technique in administering the vaccine(s) to me. And I feel sorry for all his prior and subsequent patients, both young and old.  Upon reading articles on the internet about the proper technique for administering shots (in order to help explain the extraordinary pain I've been having in my right shoulder weeks after my shot at Pharmacy on 10/9/2020), I've come to the conclusion that the needle was too long. Also, I don't remember the pharmacist bunching up my muscle first before giving me the shot. I'm not saying that it didn't happen; it's just that I don't remember whether he did or not. In my mind, I'm thinking that he didn't.",,,,,,,,Y,N,10/09/2020,10/09/2020,0,"Does not apply, but I want to know if my vaccines are still valid if, in fact, they were not administered directly into the muscle like they were supposed to.

Caller did not have a reaction to it other than a site reaction. Where the shot was it was a little red. It wasn't a big reaction. He said she only had to have the pneumonia vaccine once every five years. The next year he said she need to get the Pneumonia vaccine because the CDC said everyone has to get it. It was Prevnar 13. She had rashing, heat, swelling, and difficulty breathing from the Prevnar 13. That was when she was 66, so it was 6 years ago.

At about 12:00pm he started crying inconsolably, but wouldn?t move.  I said, ?come here,? but he just stood there, cries turning to screams. I grab his hand to get him to walk closer, but he falls over and does not get up.  I pick him up, trying to calm him, but he?s still crying uncontrollably.  I try to stand him in my lap, but he feels limp. I check everything on him, making sure he?s okay, seeing what I can do to help, nothing helps.  I have no clue what?s going on or how to help, so I call the doctors office - I can only hear some of what they are saying, but I try to tell the nurse what?s going on while he cries in the background, the nurse told me that soreness is to be expected and to give some Tylenol.  We?ve had shots before, but never any of this. Never crying like this, never going limp like this.  I finally calm him down and get him to sleep long enough for my husband to come home.  After weeks/months of research, talking to a family friend who had knowledge in this area, and a few nurse friends, I was able to discover that this was a hypotonic hypersensitive episode.   That afternoon and the following few days of that week, it?s as if Patient was re-learning how to walk. He was 15 months and had started walking at 11 months, so this was not a difficult task for him, but he was very clumsy, would stumble and fall several times a day. My husband and I both made comments to each other about him being very clumsy.  Patient also had/has a speech regression/delay which I am confident came after this. I only say this because I spent every day with him before and after and watched the regression and these are the things that I witnessed.  - Patient had been saying: Mama, Dada, Nose, Hair, had been practicing feeding himself, and when asked would point to a body part.  - 09/14/2019 he said ?sit down? his first 2 word sentence ever, (I was so proud, I documented it!) After his shot, he did not say the above words again until just a few months ago after months of speech therapy.  When I asked if he wanted to hold a utensil to help feed himself, he would act as if he were throwing a tantrum.  When his toys (that he has played with for months) would make a noise, he would flinch, when prior to the shot, he never did this.  He did not point to his body parts again for months as well, until speech therapy and months of me working with him again.   A few treatments that have helped are, of course, speech therapy (he began this in maybe February) and glutathione cream.

0902497,12/15/2020,NE,3.0,3,,F,,She got her shot the 20th had a slight fever that night but the Dr said that it was normal and it was gone the next day. Everything was going good then the night of December 9th I was helping her wipe after potty time and I noticed some little specks. Didnt think much of it since there was none any where else at the time. They got a little bigger and a little more red but i figured shes a kid and was scooting around on the ground so I didnt think much of it put some lotion on. December 13th come and she woke up and had those little spots down on her ankles and im like geeze maybe we have bugs in the house. So I checked everybody and couldnt find anybody else who has any little bumps. We went to my moms which is about 45 mins away spent the day with her and she just keeps getting more spots but only on her legs. Then im like well maybe she has the chicken pox! My mom looks at them and they just started growing right before our eyes!   So I go to head home and in that 45 min window they grew about 4X the original size and are now completely covering her legs and butt. I call my nurse friend and shes like maybe its Hives give her some benadryl and see what they look like in the morning so i do that. In the morning they were a dark deep redish purple almost like a bruise so i called the clinic to get her in. They ask a bunch of questions and have her pee in a hat and come back tell me that its something called HSP.   Dr didn't really explain much on what causes it he just said that it can be caused by a few things. So i check the CDC for it and one of the things listed for a cause is the chicken pox. She hasn't been sick hasn't been around anybody who has been sick we have not changed her diet etc so i fell like its an adverse reaction to the shot.   Once he explained to me some of the symptoms I feel like she was showing sooner then December 9th because shes been complaining about her legs and her hands hurting since the first week of December and he said joint pain is a side effect of HSP.   He prescribed a steroid to help keep it out of the kidney and told us to keep an eye out for bloody urine and bloody stool.

On 27-Oct-2020, at approximately 29 weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine, route of administration, anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100265371.  On 11-Nov-2020, 15 days after receiving Afluria QIV, the subject developed prolonged premature rupture of membranes.  At gestational age of 32.6 weeks (as reported), the subject vaginally delivered a live birth, female neonate. The characteristics of the neonate included birth weight of 1984 grams, head circumference: 30 cm and length: 44.5 cm. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes). No data for APGAR score at 10 minutes was provided. No MCM was identified at birth.  On the same day, the subject recovered from prolonged premature rupture of membranes.   The outcome of 'premature delivery' was not reported.  The events of 'premature delivery' and 'premature rupture of membranes' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus' Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment.  This case is linked to the case 202007591 (the corresponding baby case).  Company comment: A 31-year-old pregnant subject developed preterm premature rupture of membranes 15 days after vaccination with the suspect product, Afluria QIV. Reportedly, the event of premature delivery emerged 26 days post vaccination, at gestational age of 32.6 weeks. Chronology is unsuggestive.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the pain in extremity, nerve pain, discomfort and intramuscular formulation administered by other route to be related to Shingrix. The reporter considered the injection site pain to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were received as follows: The patient received Shingrix around 2:00 or 2:30 pm in the left deltoid. The customer care asked, if the shot was given intramuscularly and the patient said he thinks so but was not sure because but the person administering the shot did pinch his skin up and he states that he did not recall his skin being pinched up for Shingrix dose 1. He indicated that he did not know if pinching the skin up would have affected the ability of the needle to reach the muscle. When asked the patient if the injection was done on the back of the arm and he said no.   The patient was experiencing soreness at the injection site (left shoulder). This had not resolved. He reported that yesterday by evening he experienced twinges (of pain) in his left thigh. He was not sure if it was nerve pain perhaps shingles-type nerve pain. The pain was on the inside of the left thigh, high up, sharp and local. He said the pain kept him up for a couple hours last night (in the middle of the night) because he couldn't get comfortable while sleeping. He said the pain comes and goes and he did not injure himself or do anything out of the ordinary. He said the pain comes in waves. The pain was a little better this morning  but he did have a sharp leg/thigh pain right before calling. The patient was calling because he wanted to see if he should call his doctor. He was concerned that maybe the pain could be something serious like a blood clot. He stated he was almost sure this the thigh pain wa related to the Shingrix shot because it started a few hours after getting the shot.

Since symptoms were similar, I got a COVID test on 11/21 which was negative. 11/24 I developed hives over my whole body, mouth, lips, torso, thighs, arms, which lasted 3 weeks. The doctor prescribed Hydroxyzine which didn't help much. On 11/25 - the Dr. prescribed Prednisone 20mg to help with the hives and calm it down. On 11/28 developed wheezing, shortness of breath and on 11/30 - was analyzed for heart and lungs issues by paramedics. On 12/8 - GP - Dr. diagnosed me with possible reactive airway dysfunction and prescribed an inhaler.   I've found that then inhaler alone does not do the trick.  Since the word reactive is in the diagnosis, I figured I'd try an antihistamine.  I tried Benadryl but it is not as long lasting.  On Sunday, I tried taking  a Benadryl over night and then didn't take a Zyrtec first thing to see how it went. I did not go out to the barn or do any big activities.  I ended up having breathing problems.     I'm 67 and have never had a reaction like this in my life. I am still having breathing problems as of today 12/16.

No big deal.  I went about my activities.  Previous to this, I have never used an inhaler in my life. I'm not a smoker. I've started taking Zyrtec 1x per day in the morning  to help with the reactive lung issues. This seems to work the best at this time.  If I don't take it, I start having breathing issues.    I am allergic to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and cephalosporins.   I am a professional photographer, do quite a bit of walking for my profession.   I also have horses, ride 2-3 times per week & do daily chores with the horses. I also care for my grandson part time.  I'm an active person. This has left me with much lower energy and breathing problems which I've never experienced in my life!  I don't know if this is permanent, but I sure hope not!  It has prevented me from caring for my grandson at times, has curtailed my riding and horse care activities, and has curtailed my ability to hike and walk for my photographic business.

The events 'premature baby 26 to 32 weeks' and 'low birth weight baby' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  This case is linked to the case 202007590, the corresponding mother case.  Company comment: A female neonate subject, whose mother was 31-year-old pregnant subject, experienced premature baby and low birth weight baby 15 days after administration of Afluria QIV to the subject's mother. Causality is assessed as unrelated to vaccine due to unsuggestive chronology and biological implausibility and more likely related to the increased BMI of the subject's mother. Increased BMI most likely resulted in premature rupture of membranes and premature delivery/ low birth weight baby. Foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as unrelated per company conventions.; Sender's Comments: A female neonate subject, whose mother was 31-year-old pregnant subject, experienced premature baby and low birth weight baby 15 days after administration of Afluria QIV to the subject's mother.

It seemed to get a little better over the next few days, but the pain never actually went away.  It just dulled.  On 12/12/2020, I began to become concerned because it had been a week since receiving the shot and I still was experiencing pain.  I noticed the pain was worse when I slept at night and my range of motion was becoming worse.  I tried taking Tylenol and icing the area, but the pain was only temporarily dulled.  I woke up throughout the early morning of 12/15/2020 with excruciating pain in my left shoulder and arm.  I called out of work and went to a doctor's office to be evaluated.  I was diagnosed with subacromial bursitis of the left shoulder.  Currently, I am wearing a sling to get through the work day and cannot move my arm much because it is too painful.  It is hard to function occupationally and I am having a hard time doing simple tasks, such as putting my clothes on and going to the bathroom.  I was told it would probably take weeks to heal and was referred to physical therapy in the meantime.  I am currently not sure if this will result in permanent damage or disability.

There were no other causes for the hives such as clothing, soap, detergent, etc.  The hives would come back up on different parts of my body for the following weeks.

From this point, I have seen a dermatologist, several allergists, an infectious disease specialist regarding why I am having systemic hives that are not controlled by allergy medications.  I underwent many tests and procedures including a biopsy of my skin hive, and a test that came back as markers for Lupus were present.    I was taking several allergy medications, Predisone steroids long term, and  Zantac for the awful heartburn and indigestion that felt like I was having a heart attack- I also have dental enamel damage from those years of intense acid indigestion. I was prescribed an epipen because my throat and tongue would swell up so bad.  My face would swell so much that I couldn't see due to my eyes being swollen shut.  I could not walk because the hives covered the bottoms of my feet.  I spent the last part of my high school career and much of the first part of my college life miserable and covered in hives.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the femur fracture to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in a 76-year-old female patient, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis. The patient had past medical history of hyperlipidemia, asthma, macular degeneration, and two previous episodes of pancreatitis of unknown origin. The patient denied recent camping, hiking, insect bites, and prior neuropathy/myopathy. However, the patient did report a mild upper respiratory tract infection ten weeks prior to admission. No information on patient's family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, 10 (ten) days before hospitalization, the patient received Shingrix (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided but it could be 75 years or 76 years. [The Patient stated that she had received the new Shingrix (Recombinant Zoster) vaccine ten days before hospitalization]. On an unspecified date, 10 days after vaccination, the patient presented with a two-day history of bilateral proximal lower extremity weakness. The patient reported that the patient had progressive weakness that initially started with inability to ascend stairs. This progressed to difficulty with standing and a subsequent non-traumatic fall. These described symptoms deviated significantly from her baseline. The Patient's baseline consisted of independence with mobility and activities of daily living. The patient did not require any assistive devices. On presentation, the patient was afebrile (98.4 degree Fahrenheit), had a normal respiratory rate (17 breaths/minute), had an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and was normotensive (136/76 mmHg). The patient reported paresthesias and numbness on the dorsal region of her right lower extremity and difficulty lifting both legs. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, cranial nerves II-XII were intact, there was 5/5 bilateral upper extremity strength, and 5/5 bilateral lower extremity strength with dorsiflexion. The patient had normal sensation bilaterally in upper and lower extremities. However, the patient had 3/5 lower bilateral extremity strength with hip flexion. Furthermore, that patient had bilateral absent Patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes. On further assessment, the patient's labs were unremarkable. A computed tomography scan of the brain was performed, which revealed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. The report did endorse microvascular ischemic disease involving the white matter. These results were found to be secondary to aging. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and lumbar spinal cord was only positive for degenerative antegrade spondylolisthesis deformity at L5-S1. Over the next 24 hours, the patient reported worsening lower extremity paresthesias and weakness. The patient could no longer stand without assistance. The patient also stated that having neuropathic pain in bilateral lower extremities; burning, tingling, and electrical shock sensations. Furthermore, the patient described new difficulties with swallowing. An endoscopy was performed, and the patient was described to have esophageal dysmotility because the patient was unable to pass the barium pill during the examination. Consequently, a lumbar puncture was performed due to concern for disease progression. Lumbar cerebral spinal fluid studies revealed an elevated protein level (61 mg/dL), a normal white blood cell count (0 CUMM), and a cytoalbuminogenic dissociation. These results indicated acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (GBS). Neurologic consultation was obtained. No electrodiagnostic studies were performed. The patient was diagnosed with Guillen Barre Syndrome likely secondary to Shingrix vaccine. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg divided over five days) was initiated. The patient showed gradual improvements with five days of treatment and was transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility (Hospital day 5). At discharge, the patient's bilateral Patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes remained absent. However, the patient was able to stand and ambulate with a walker. Five days after discharge to the rehab facility, the patient reported worsening of bilateral lower extremity pain (per patient, this pain was worse than her prior admission). The patient was therefore readmitted to the hospital. On examination, the patient had 5/5 bilateral upper extremity strength, 5/5 bilateral strength on lower extremity dorsiflexion, normal bilateral sensation in upper and lower extremities, and 3/5 bilateral lower extremity hip flexion strength. This strength assessment was consistent with the patient's previous presentation. Furthermore, light touch sensation was intact in all four extremities. There was no apparent sensory loss. Bilateral Achilles and Patellar tendon reflexes remained absent. However, the patient could no longer stand with and without assistance and therefore could no longer ambulate. This presentation significantly deviated from her prior discharge appearance. Initially the patient described neuropathic pain and therefore, the patient was treated with Gabapentin and amitriptyline. However, the patient became hyponatremic (133 mmol/L on admission to 122 mmol/L after treatment) and had significant fluctuations in her blood pressure (ranging from 110/67 mmHg to 182/88 mmHg). Additionally, the patient unfortunately feels due to weakness while attempting to walk with assistance. The patient suffered a nondisplaced spiral fracture through the distal fibular metaphysis and had a large ankle joint effusion. The patient was seen by Orthopedic Surgery and was placed in a CAM boot. Plasma exchange was initiated because the patient's muscular strength continued to decline, and her lower extremity pain was increasing. After undergoing three plasma exchange treatments, the patient showed remarkable improvement with lower extremity strength and power. The patient was then able to ambulate the hospital halls with the use of a walker and some assistance after five treatments of plasma exchange. Additionally, the patient's neuropathic pain improved. The patient was then discharged to an acute rehabilitation center with scheduled physical therapy. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The author commented, ""We present a case of Guillian-Barre syndrome that occurred 10 days after Shingrix vaccine administration. We identified no other possible etiology of the patient's symptoms. The patient displayed several key features of GBS established by the Brighton Criteria of weakness; paresthesias, diminished Patellar and Achilles deep tendon reflexes, hyponatremia secondary to Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH), dysautonomia, and cytoalbuminological dissociation on cerebral spinal fluid analysis. We believe that this is an example of post-vaccine related Guillain-Barre Syndrome, given the timing of the presentation and when she received her vaccine. While electrodiagnostic studies have been used to help diagnose GBS secondary to bacterial, viral, and vaccination origins, these results are not necessary. The diagnosis of GBS is confirmed with the elevated CSF protein level and absence of deep tendon reflexes (found in 90% of GBS affected patients). Additionally, it can take up to four weeks before electrodiagnostic studies show loss of motor and sensory response secondary to GBS. There have been numerous vaccines connected to GBS, including the H1N1 swine flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine. However, the newly release Shingrix vaccine has yet to be reported to be associated with this potentially life threatening polyradiculoneuropathy. Documented adverse reactions to the Shingrix vaccination from eight high quality randomized control trials, include local injection site rash or irritation, disseminated rash, herpes zoster infection in immunocompetent patients, and life-threatening complications in immunocompromised recipients. However, none of these studies demonstrated a relationship between Shingrix, nor the previous Zoster vaccine, to GBS. As a result, GBS likely secondary to the Shingrix vaccine could not have been expected in this patient after receiving this immunization. In summary, the bacterial lipopolysaccharide epitope acts as a molecular mimicker. The precise nature by which this occurs is still unclear. Therefore, the mechanism by which GBS may result from Shingrix vaccine remains unknown. If further cases reveal a similar association, this should be further explored. Per this case report and prior documentation of GBS secondary to herpes zoster, there is now evidence to state that antibodies generated in a lab against herpes zoster and then given intramuscularly via vaccination (Shingrix) may be a sufficient nidus for Guillain-Barre syndrome."" The author concluded, ""In summary, we present a case of GBS that occurred shortly after Shingrix vaccination. Our case is consistent with other vaccine and herpes zoster related cases of GBS.

Concurrent medical conditions included neuropathy.   On an unknown date, the patient received Shingrix. On an unknown date, 10 days after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced guillain barre syndrome (serious criteria GSK medically significant), demyelinating polyneuropathy (serious criteria GSK medically significant), tingling of extremity, hypoesthesia, areflexia, loss of sensation, joint range of motion decreased and fall. The patient was treated with doxycycline and immunoglobulins nos (Ivig). On an unknown date, the outcome of the guillain barre syndrome, demyelinating polyneuropathy, tingling of extremity, hypoesthesia, areflexia, loss of sensation, joint range of motion decreased and fall were unknown.   The reporter considered the guillain barre syndrome, demyelinating polyneuropathy, tingling of extremity, hypoesthesia, areflexia, loss of sensation, joint range of motion decreased and fall to be possibly related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), in a 79-year-old male patient, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.  The patient had a history of clinically diagnosed neuropathy by his primary care physician (PCP). No information on patient family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported. n an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with Shingrix (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported but it could be between 78 or 79 years old at the time of vaccination. On an unspecified date, 10 days after vaccination, the patient had onset of symptoms. The patient initially presented with symptoms of progressive tingling and numbness in his feet for over a week to the urgent care clinic. At the baseline, the patient was very active, and the history was negative for any other relevant symptoms. The neurological examination at the urgent care was reported unremarkable (no further details available). Due to the patient's history of outdoor activities, the patient got empirically treated with doxycycline, and blood drawn for tick-borne serologies came back negative. The patient returned with worsening paresthesia and weakness in his legs, which culminated in a fall. A neurological examination done on this visit showed diminished pinprick and vibration bilaterally from the toes to the knees with areflexia at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and Achilles despite Jendrassik maneuver. Romberg was positive, with no dysmetria on finger to nose test. The patient gait was broad-based. There was no loss of sensation in the upper limbs. Motor examination showed a weakness with foot dorsiflexion and medical research council- MRC grading of 4/5 for bilateral hip flexion and knee extension. Lumbar puncture showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Protein: 195 mg/dl, with a normal corrected white blood cell (WBC) count. Electrodiagnostic study (Nerve conduction study (NCS)) revealed demyelinating polyneuropathy was done. The motor NCS shows prolonged latency and slowed conduction velocity in addition to reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes in some nerves due to pre-existing neuropathy. The results of NCS were: Left median: nerve site was wrist showing latency 7.7 m/s (reference: less than 4.2 m/s) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude was 4.0 mV (reference: more than 4.0 mV). Nerve site was elbow showing latency 14.3 m/s, CMAP amplitude was 3.6 mV and conduction velocity was 37.5 m/s (reference: 50 m/s). Right Ulnar: nerve site was wrist showing latency 4.2 m/s (reference: less than 3.6 m/s) and CMAP amplitude was 7.2 mV (reference: more than 5.0 mV). Nerve site was below elbow showing latency 10.3 m/s, CMAP amplitude was 6.0 mV and conduction velocity was 41.3 m/s. Nerve site was above elbow showing latency 13.0 m/s, CMAP amplitude 5.7 mV and conduction velocity was 36.6 m/s (reference: 50.0 m/s). Left/Right Peroneal: nerve site was ankle and results were not recordable for both left and right (reference for latency less than 6.0 m/s; reference for CMPA amplitude more than 2.5 mV). Left tibial: nerve site was ankle showing latency 15.6 m/s (reference: less than 6.6 m/s) and CMAP amplitude was 0.9 mV (reference: more than 2.0 mV). Nerve site was knee showing latency 32.2 m/s, CMAP amplitude was 0.3 mV and conduction velocity was 27.1 m/s. Right tibial: nerve site was wrist showing latency 9.1 m/s (reference: less than 6.6 m/s) and CMAP amplitude was 1.9 mV (reference: more than 2.0 mV). Nerve site was knee showing latency 27.1 m/s, CMAP amplitude was 1.1 mV and conduction velocity was 25.2 m/s (reference: 40 m/s). Left Peroneal Tibialis Anterior: nerve site was fibular head showing latency 4.0 m/s (reference: less than 4.0 m/s) and CMAP amplitude was 4.0 mV (reference: more than 4.0 mV). Nerve site was knee showing latency 6.9 m/s, CMAP amplitude was 3.9 mV and conduction velocity was 33.7 m/s (reference: 40 m/s). Right Peroneal Tibialis Anterior: nerve site was fibular head showing latency 12.4 m/s (reference: less than 4.0 m/s) and CMAP amplitude was 2.5 mV (reference: more than 4.0 mV). Nerve site was knee showing latency 14.4 m/s, CMAP amplitude was 2.2 mV and conduction velocity was 48.3 m/s (reference: 40 m/s). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with contrast showed enlarged and enhancing nerve roots involving L1 through S1. The patient was diagnosed with GBS. The patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (2g/kg body weight over 5 days), resulting in improvement of strength with residual pinprick sensation deficit only in the toes and reduced vibration in his feet from his previous neuropathy two months after treatment. Outcome was not reported. The authors commented, The temporal association of the development of autoimmune neuromuscular disorders and vaccine administration is well documented. Several vaccines, although beneficial, have proposed to be implicated in the development of autoimmune disorders, especially GBS. The precise mechanism is unknown, but one probable cause could be the vaccine components eliciting an exaggerated immune response. As stated earlier, the Shingrix vaccine consists of the glycoprotein E and adjuvant AS01B. Adjuvants, by definition, are substances that augment antigen-specific immune response. However, studies reported the role of adjuvants in causing autoimmunity by molecular mimicry and simulating an immune reaction in animal models or humans similar to the bacterial or viral infections. Although hypothesized that the Shingrix vaccine may have led to GBS in our patient, the exact pathogenesis is still not clear. In addition to the adjuvants, immune responses directed against the Glycoprotein E can also result in autoantibodies or T-cell activation that cross-react with ganglioside GM1 in the myelin resulting in immunological damage to the peripheral nerve sheaths. Further in vitro studies will be required to assess this relationship.

This is a 27-year-old female with a past medical history as above presenting with a chief complaint of concern for urticarial rash in anaphylaxis following a COVID-19 vaccination.    ï¿½ I did speak with Occupational Health who stated that this patient is well-known to the hospital, stating specifically that she becomes very anxious with vaccinations/needles and breaks out in hives on previous injections.  This information was given to his after her initial presentation.  Patient had already been removed provided epinephrine given concern of possible anaphylactic reaction given her area, diaphoresis, pruritus and diffuse urticaria. ï¿½ I was called into the room multiple times as patient continued to ask to be discharged.  I did have multiple conversations with her in regards to need for continued monitoring given possibility of anaphylactic reaction.  She feels that this was due to her anxiety and states that she is completely asymptomatic and at her baseline at this time.  She once again is asking to leave.  I did discuss my recommendation for continued monitoring as well as the risks of leaving without continued monitoring.   The patient is able to choose, communicate and make choices clearly and understandably. The patient is able to understand risks, benefits and alternatives of therapy explained by myself. The patient can make a logical and rational decisions according to my assessment. The choice made by the patient is consistent with the patient's values and is consistent with character and decision capacity in the patient's past, according to friends and family present. There is no impending medical risk to this patient to warrant my holding the patient against their will. ï¿½ Patient will be discharged in stable condition at this time with strict return precautions and instructions for close outpatient follow-up.

Systolic BP's were 138, then 120's, then 101 prior to me leaving ambulance. Finger stick was 140. I was in the ambulance for about 15 minutes and was feeling much better the last 5 minutes or so of that. I declined need to go to ER, my daughter then drove. I then went to a store and while walking around at 1105, began to feel my heart racing again but not as intense. Had slight feeling of being shaky but nothing like previously. After that, I have felt fine for the rest of the day. I took 400mg Ibuprofen for a slight HA around 1130 but not unusual for me, especially since the events that occured.

On my way home approximately 25 minutes after my vaccination I felt a tingling and numbness in the back of my throat. I decided to call the center and let them know how I was feeling. They suggested I return. During the 10 minute ride back the tingling and numbness had progressed to the back of my tongue. Once I arrived there they continued to monitor me and my symptoms remained stable with numbness in my throat and back of my tongue. I was not having any difficulty breathing and felt otherwise fine. There was a concern that the symptoms would progress and they initiated EMS. I was taken via ambulance to Hospital where they continued to monitor me and check my airway.. In route to the hospital I was hypertensive with a BP of approx 190/100. I did not ask what my heart rate was. I was surprised my blood pressure was so high. They said it was probably because I was nervous however I was not feeling nervous because I knew since I could breathe I really was fine, and sending me to the hospital was simply out of an abundance of caution as this vaccine is new. Upon my arrival they took my blood pressure again and it was 140s/80s I believe with a heart rate of 106. My O2 sat we?re in the upper 90?s throughout the situation. My blood pressure tends to be in the 110s/70s with a heart rate in the upper 60s to mid 70s. So it was surprising to me that I was hypertensive and tachycardic despite not feeling like my heart was racing or that my blood pressure was high. I felt completely fine other than the numbness in the back of my throat and tongue. Since the symptoms remained stable and there wasn?t really anything for anybody to do they did release me.

A 65-year-old female patient received pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm site on 12Dec2020 at single dose for immunization; influenza vaccine, via an unspecified route of administration at right arm site on 12Dec2020 at unknown dose for immunization. The patient's medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine. Clinical course: Patient had never had a Pneumonia shot before, and she got it, and she does not know how many hours it was before she had the side effect, but she got the shot in like the afternoon on 12Dec2020, and that night when she went to bed, there was a big red area around where the shot had been administered, the area had turned red, but it was not as bright when it started, as when she went to bed, and her arm hurt. She had the worst night that night, she felt like she had a major flu, her body ached all over, and she took Aspirin, and she had a high fever of like 103 degrees, and she had body aches. The next morning (on 13Dec2020), she didn't feel good, but it was nothing compared to how bad the night before had been, it was like she had the worst flu ever. On 13Dec2020, the patient was just wiped out, but she did not feel like she was dying, like she had the night before. it was stated, with a laugh, that she ever told her husband to shoot her because she was so miserable. She has never had a pneumococcal 13-Val Conj Vac (Dipht CRM197 Protein) before, but she is 65, so she was told she should get one. She had been taking influenza vaccine every year since like 1999, and she has never had a problem with the influenza vaccine. So, she did not think it was the influenza vaccine. When she actually received the Pneumonia Vaccine, the injection itself did not hurt, but it was like later when the caller went to bed that her problems started. When she rolled over on to her arm, her arm hurt, and then as she was going to sleep, her symptoms just got worse overnight. It was like a horrible flu, where her body was achy, and she had a fever. She took 5 baby Aspirin, or like the heart ones that are 81mg. She is not currently home, and where she is staying is like an hour from the closest hospital. Several hours after the first set of Aspirin she took, she took 5 more of the 81mg Aspirin, and then she took some Ibuprofen later because she was hurting. On 13Dec2020, she still was hurting, but it was nothing like that first night, and on 14Dec2020, she is feeling a lot better. It was stated that if she knew how severe the side effects might be, she might not have taken it. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she felt great, but it was not until after she went to bed and went to sleep that the side effects started. It did not last for days and days but did stay in bed yesterday. She still felt like she has had some energy taken out of her, but it was nothing like that first night. She had not had any fevers since 13Dec2020 afternoon, and it was all lighter, but she still didn't get out of bed much on 13Dec2020. On 14Dec2020, she had been able to get up and get on her computer and such. she did still have body aches and soreness and achiness at this time, but they had improved. Her weight is somewhere between 130 and 135 pounds. She did not know the name of the influenza vaccine and pneumococcal 13-Val Conj Vac (Dipht CRM197 Protein) she received, nor did she know the manufacturer, NDC number, Lot number, Expiry, formulation, or dose. She knew some people say to not get the Flu Shot but the she was a firm believer in it, she had done it so many years, since 1998 or 1999, and had never had a problem, but she had never had a pneumococcal 13-Val Conj Vac (Dipht CRM197 Protein), this was her first one, and she had the problem; so she couldn't say 100% it was the pneumococcal 13-Val Conj Vac (Dipht CRM197 Protein) that caused her problem, but she was assuming it was.

About a week after first shot on September 28, 2020, I had an acute onset of tinnitus. I've never had persistent ringing in my ears before. Symptoms waxed and waned in the following weeks, largely subsiding by the time of the second shot. About five days after second shot, symptoms started ticking up again. Noticed that symptoms can be worse after eating. Might be some stomach/inner ear nerve correlation, since there is some gut pain/inflammation after shots for a few days?   Went to doctor about 10 days after first onset. No inner ear infection. I told her that it was hardly noticeable that day and that melatonin the night before might have helped. Recommended I continue taking melatonin and follow up if symptoms persist. Have not been back to doctor since symptoms were slowly disappearing.  It's been about a week since second shot. Will see if symptoms subside in next few weeks as with first shot. Will visit primary physician or ENT specialist if symptoms persist. I filed similar report with GlaxoSmithKline on this day, December 21, 2020.
