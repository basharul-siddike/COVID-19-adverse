0907505,12/23/2020,NJ,28.0,28,,M,,"Initial symptom date was 12/20/2020 around 4PM while driving.  I felt hot, dizzy, and short of breath with no  prodromal symptoms.  I had felt as if my brain was in a fog the entire time and was having intermittent waxing and waning bouts of worse shortness of breath.  However, the pulse oximetry at the time was within normal limits ranging from 95% to 99% at rest but with a few instances where it dropped to 94%.  At that time, I had returned back home and laid in bed.  I did feel anxious because I have never had these symptoms in the past.  Admittedly I was worried that it could have been COVID.  So I went with my symptoms to the ED later that day because I developed nausea and near vomiting (I am a reluctant vomiter and it is hard for me to vomit).  There I was given antiemetics and fluids and had a CBC done along with a thyroid panel which were within normal limits.  I was discharged with zofran after feeling improved with the treatment at the ED.  The next day I was feeling weak but the feeling of shortness of breath was intermittent but not unmanageable.  I could see that with my portable pulse oximeter that my pulse ox sometimes dropped to 93/94% on room air while I was walking around so I opted to stay in bed.  I was able to eat some food at this point because the nausea has improved.  I am staying hydrated with both water and Gatorade.  I received my results of the COVID19 swab at 18:40 and it was negative and not in a pooled sample.  I am relieved but I still feel the similar symptoms previously described above.  I then prepared to go to bed and after taking a shower I went to lay down and felt hot all over and extremely nauseous with a right sided headache and mild dizziness.  At this point, I feel my heart is racing and my chest is burning.  I was able to check my pulse ox and it was great, 99% the time I was sitting there but my pulse was in the 110s.  As these events unfold, naturally I am feeling very anxious about the prognosis as I have not had these symptoms before.  I was brought to the ED again on 12/22/20 for those symptoms and was given IV Reglan and Benadryl to help with the nausea and headache.  The medications helped but I did have another episode of palpitations while receiving the medications.  I discussed with the ED physician that it might still be anxiety and to not rule it out and was given 2mg of Ativan by mouth.  Afterwards I felt calmer but I still felt unwell.",,,,,,,,,U,12/18/2020,12/20/2020,2,"COVID19 test  negative on 12/20/20, normal cbc 12/20/20, normal tsh  normal cbc, negative d-dimer, negative troponins",PVT,,bergamot BPF,no other illnesses,high cholesterol,,,2,12/23/2020,,,Y,"no known allergies to medications, some reaction (hives) to certain laundry detergents"

I also had red splotches over my entire body (not a rash but redness).  When I alerted the vaccination staff that I thought I was having a reaction they all seemed shocked. They didn?t really know what to do and asked me what I wanted to do. I, myself, was having a hard time making choices since I was in a bit of a panic. They wanted to give me oral Benadryl but since I was having the reaction in my throat and mouth one of the nurses suggested IM Benadryl.  They gave me that shot around 1405. They watched me for about an hour and I still had the numbness in my lips and tongue and the red splotches over my entire body.  (During this entire time no one took my BP or pulse).

As the day progressed, the body aches got more severe and were accompanied by a headache and fever by around 7 PM. I literally felt like I was dying, and have never had body aches that bad before in my life. I laid on my couch and didn't move until 11 PM, with no apetite, and then went to bed. The day after that, when I woke up the body aches weren't as bad, and my temp was 98.8. Again, around 3 the body aches started getting worse, I was so tired I could barely function, couldn't eat without being nauseous, and laid in bed as still as possible until I could fall asleep. The Saturday following my vaccine, I woke up at 6 and my body hurt so bad it felt like I couldn't move, my head was so bad even the light from the shades felt like it was piercing me, and I still had no apetite. I stayed in bed until 10 until the body aches got a little better, and was able to go about my day almost as normal, just with my body feeling kind of like I slipped and fell on ice. On Sunday, I still had no apetite and was nauseous without even eating. My body still ached, but I was able to do things like the dishes and just hang out at home. My headache was still unbearable. I called the hotline number for my hospital that was given to me when I got my vaccine, and they scheduled a COVID nasal swab test at 1. I put on sunglasses to drive the 10 minutes to the clinic, got my test, and went home and went to bed. Since I had a COVID test ordered by my employer, I wasn't allowed to work until I got the results and HR cleared me. The results were negative, and I didn't get cleared by HR until Monday morning. When I contacted my supervisor, he wanted me to stay home anyway since the body aches (even though they were getting better), fatigue, headache and nausea were still there, regardless of a negative covid test. He was worried I had the flu. I made an appointment with my primary care doctor for 2:10 on Monday, and he told me it was just serum sickness. I went home and went to bed.

The patient had a severe allergic reaction to a meningococcal B vaccine on an unspecified date but she was not sure which brand of vaccine she received. She was asking if any ingredients are the same in the COVID-19 vaccine and if it would be safe to take the COVID-19 vaccine. She had a bad reaction to both doses of the meningitis vaccine and has Thalassemia. She had her first dose of the meningitis vaccine at age 19 and the second dose at age 20. When she got the first dose, she had a diagnosis of mononucleosis. She didn't realize it was the vaccine at first. She thought it was a complication from ""mono"". She had a really bad headache that lasted for a couple of days. She had full body fatigue and full body weakness. She didn't have any other diagnoses when she took the second dose. She had a really bad rash around the insertion site. She had hives on the arm, headaches and fatigue. She had to go to the emergency room for it because it was so frightening. She was not hospitalized and was discharged from the emergency room. The second one was given in Jul2020 at around 8AM or 9AM. Thalassemia was diagnosed early on in life prior to receiving the meningitis vaccine. It was also reported that the patient had splenomegaly and hepatomegaly because of ""Mono"", so she was taking a low dose of hydrocodone to help with pain. She was not on any other medication at the time she received the vaccine. When she had Mono in 2019 they did a complete CBC and her WBC was 17,000, so it was pretty high. They didn't do any pain blood work this year (2020). They had ruled it out as an allergic reaction. They had done a hematocrit and hemoglobin and it was normal. It was further reported that around noon after receiving the second dose, she started feeling bad. She had long sleeves on and wasn't looking at the arm. When she got out the shower the next day, her mom noticed her arm. It was a huge rash. She doesn't know if the rash was there before or not. She had her influenza vaccine after that by a couple of weeks. She was worried to have another reaction. She had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Lot#: EK5730) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 afternoon at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Caller was unable to confirm the manufacturer of the vaccine that she received. It is not written on the card, and she didn't see the vial. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included oral contraception pill, but the name was unknown. Fifteen to twenty minutes after she received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 she became light headed and dizzy. She had to catch her breath. She couldn't shake it off. The light headedness and dizziness lasted at that intensity for 10 minutes, but it never went away. They encouraged her to be admitted in the emergency room (ER). She would say that the seriousness of being light headed and dizzy was disabling. Caller didn't remember the exact numbers for her blood pressure. It was 160's over 105. Her heart rate was in the low 100's, around 105. She stayed at the first monitoring station in the vaccine area for 2 hours. They were taking her blood pressure every five minutes. She was given diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) there and lots of water. After 3 hours and she was not improving they called a ""code medic"" that got the medical director and nursing supervisor to come. They encouraged her to go to the ER for continual monitoring. She stayed in the ER for4 hours and was given meds to help with the blood pressure. She was discharged from the ER home. She was nervous because of all this stemming from the vaccine. She had a low grade fever on 18Dec2020 (Friday) night. Caller stated her work had already reported her reaction. Occupational safety and the medical director are aware. Caller does not have reference number to provide. On 18Dec2020 (Friday) she was not overly concerned because it was the next day. Her blood pressure was high and her heart rate was in the 100's. They monitored her for a couple of hours and she was given a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She went to the emergency room (ER) for a few more hours and received additional treatment. They sent her home to be monitored at home. She has been taking her blood pressure every day since and it had not come down. It was still really high. She called her primary care doctor. He was wanting her to start blood pressure for medication it. She was concerned about starting it with the assumption that it was related to the vaccine. She would like to know the right thing to do. It seems safe to take the medicine, but it was unknown that whether it was going to mask the blood pressure and something else be going on. On 18Dec2020 she still had a headache and didn't feel well, but she thought she needed to give it some time. She had been anticipating not to feel well on 18Dec2020 (Friday). On 19Dec2020 she felt better considering she didn't have a headache. On 19Dec2020 (Saturday) her blood pressure was 138/90 and she felt good.

This went away after an hour or so.   My arm felt totally normal right after the vaccine, but later in the evening it worsened and I had a dead arm for about 24 hours.  The next morning when I awoke I felt there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I couldn't catch my breath or take in a deep breath. I tried to walk down the stairs to get my inhaler, but was so dizzy I had to hang on to the railing in order not to fall. When I got to my medication cabinet I had difficulty opening the cupboard. I took my inhaler and the chest pain seemed to ease up as the day progressed. I had such terrible body aches that I tried to open a bottle of Ibuprofen and had extreme difficulty with my fingers. Throughout the day my fingers were cramped up and I was unable to hold on to anything, even the steering wheel of my car to drive. My hands were so sore that I tried massaging them but nothing helped. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol every 4 hours to help and after about 48 hours the intense burning, aching, and cramping somewhat subsided. Over a week later, I am still struggling to use my cell phone and text messaging. My fingers are not working right so I am hoping that will go away.   In addition, I have been achy with chills  since the morning after getting the vaccine. I can not seem to warm up. I have tried warm baths and sleeping with hot pads, but I have terrible chills and aches. My joints and muscle hurt all over my body to the point that now I have made an appointment with a doctor to see if the vaccine caused some kind of autoimmune reaction. My fingers, hips, and knees are the areas that hurt the worst still. I am a marathon runner and was currently training and doing well. After the vaccine, my joints and muscles have been so painful that I haven't been able to maintain what I was currently doing with running. I have ended up icing or heating different parts of my body daily and gone through a lot of ibuprofen, naproxen, and Tylenol trying to find relief. My entire body is covered in Icy Hot as that seems to help a little.

I took a Benadryl without relief. I had a 100.1 fever that afternoon so I took another Benadryl and ibuprofen. It broke my fever, but the itching continued. I also had a couple of hives and a red blotchy rash over my body. I  took a hydroxyzine and was able to sleep that night. The next morning I once again felt flushed and itchy. I worked and came home to the same rash, almost mottled looking all over my body. I  took a Benadryl and ibuprofen and woke up early this morning itching again. As I was driving into work today (Monday), I noticed my heart fluttering and having palpitations. This continued throughout the morning. My skin rash is still red like I have a bad sunburn all over and is itchy with some red spots. I went to the ER to get checked out. My ekg was normal. They advised me that this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine and to continue 50mg Benadryl q6h for a couple more days and to see a PCP for follow up if it?s not better.

I did not have any adverse symptoms until the night of December 24th around 11:30 p.m.  It started that night with nausea.  I initially thought it was something I had eaten. I went to bed feeling nauseous but fell asleep.  I slept through the night, and work up the next morning, December 25th,  still nauseous.  I did not ever vomit, even though I very much thought I would.   As the day progressed, I developed chills and a low-grade fever.  This continued through the day. The nausea was terrible! I could not eat anything because the mere thought of food made me feel sicker. I drank very little as well.  I also developed flu like symptoms.  I could not stand to be touched, as my skin was highly sensitive to touch.  (The same feeling you get if you have a bad case of the flu.)  I used a cold wet washcloth all day, as I felt hot, but my fever never went over 99.7 degrees.  I eventually fell asleep that night, but I was restless. I woke up several times to noises in my home. Each time it felt like my body was trembling or my heart was racing or fluttering, but these episodes did not last long, nor could I tell you for sure that was exactly what it was. I just felt shaky.  Each time I fell back asleep.  The next morning, December 26th, I awoke, and the nausea was gone, but the chills and the fever were still hanging on.  I just felt bad!  I used a cold wet washcloth on my forehead, face, and neck all day.  I did eat maybe 5-10 dry saltine crackers and drank a glass or two of sprite.  As the day progressed, I felt worse!!  The nausea came and went all afternoon and into the night. I eventually fell asleep around 10-11:00 p.m.  I slept all night. I awoke the next morning, December 27th, initially feeling nauseous again.  I made it a point to drink a lot of Gatorade and sprite throughout the day.  I found that I felt some better when I sat up but felt worse when I laid down. So, I sat for about an hour on the side of my bed. I eventually got up and walked around my house. I began to feel better and thought I might be able to shower and possibly eat. So, I did? and it was like my body did a 180!  I quickly felt so much better. I ate some soup and drank some sprite. I didn?t completely go back to my normal routine, but I did stay up the remainder of the day and did not get sick. The next day, December 28th, I felt like myself again and pretty much went back to my normal routine.   The most interesting side effects that I had that are not mentioned in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine common side effects are: *My feet were ice cold, but they were wet with sweat (I put on socks to try to warm them up, but it did not help as my socks would get damp thus making my feet colder) *My tongue became coated white  (I did not lose my sense of taste or smell) *My skin felt hot to me, even though it was not hot to the touch (I used a cold wet washcloth for 2-3 days straight)",,,,,,,,,Y,12/23/2020,12/24/2020,1,N/A,PUB,,Women's Multi-vitamin  Vitamin D3 supplement 2 prescription drugs,None,None,,,2,12/28/2020,,,,"Sulfur Dioxide Seasonal Allergies (grasses, trees, pollen)"

Just a lingering discomfort remained.  That night I was awaken by 10/10 dull pain in both my hips. I don?t have arthritis, but I imagine that is what the pain must feel like. That eventually subsided over the course of the night and then the following morning I woke up with a stronger lower back pain and major stiffness in my hamstrings, but the hip pain was gone. Throughout the day the pain would come and go and move up and down my back and along my spine. It was the strongest on the night of the 22 and has since gotten weaker and the tightens in my back and hamstrings has since left. Now I just get random aches throughout my back that come and go during the day. Yesterday, the 27th, I was hiking down a hill and the impact from that caused instant discomfort in my spine, it felt like it was compressing like an accordion. Never had this happen before. After that my back was sore for hours. Today, the 28th, I tried jogging and the spinal discomfort was instantly there. Went about thirty yards before I stopped and my back has been aching down my spine for hours.    Also been experiencing a couple mild headaches through the day since the 22nd.  This also has fired up the endothelial dysfunction in my heart which causes some strong chest pain throughout the day. I?ve gone back in my heart medication, so hopefully that will fix that issue. I will be contacting my cardiologist in regards to this and seeing if the vaccine can affect that.",,,,,,,,,N,12/20/2020,12/22/2020,2,None yet,UNK,,None,No,Endothelial dysfunction in my LAD,My mom said that when I got the mmr vaccine I got a little sick.

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had muscle soreness for about 24 hours after the shot. The patient stated, ""I received the Pfizer vaccine on 16Dec at my hospital, (Institute Name Withheld). I think our hospital management wanted to first vaccinate some key clinicians who felt very comfortable with it - I personally wanted it as soon as possible since I see patients with COVID-19 every day. Twelve hours before I received the vaccine, I took information survey and signed the consent form. At my appointment, I was asked to confirm that I was feeling OK, was given the injection, and then waited about 15 minutes to make sure I didn't experience any side effects. I had a little muscle soreness, sort of like a punch to the arm, for about 24 hours. Other than a little muscle soreness that felt similar to a punch, I felt perfectly fine. The hospital administrator said they'd be in touch to schedule the second dose, which will be within a 96-hour window about three weeks later. I believe the science behind this type of vaccine - the messenger RNA platform - is strong. Understanding the basic science of it, I have very few concerns about the efficacy of the vaccine or the long-term complications. As a mechanism, there is no live COVID -19 virus in the vaccine: It's just giving you the code for spike protein so that your immune system will be able to make antibodies. To me, it's an even safer platform than many previous types of vaccines. Many infectious diseases are managed through vaccines. Infectious diseases that we don't think of as being a big issue anymore, like polio, even chickenpox, have been all but wiped out in the US thanks to vaccines that most people now get as babies. One or two people are not going to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. It's really when we get a good majority of the population fully vaccinated that we'll start to see a major effect.  Until then, I plan to still wear my face mask, practice social distancing, and observe safety and sanitary precautions. The outcome of the event was unknown.
