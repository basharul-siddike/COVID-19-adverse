Left Carotid Artery:  Duplex imaging of the left carotid artery system notes that it is tortuous.  There is a very small shelf of smooth mixed plaque at the bifurcation and extending into the origin of the external carotid artery.  The left internal carotid artery is without plaque.  Velocity measurements in the internal carotid artery of 120/47 cm per second and the 2-D image support no significant disease or stenosis in the internal carotid artery.  The left vertebral has normal integrate flow, the left subclavian has normal traphasic flow.  Blood pressure in the left arm is 120/70.  Impression:  Normal left carotid study. Right Carotid Artery:  Duplex imaging of the right carotid artery system reveals normal vessels that are tortuous without plaque.  Velocity measurements in the internal carotid artery of 93/34 cm per second are negative for any hemodynamically significant lesion.  The right subclavian/innominate have normal traphasic flow.  Blood pressure in the right arm is 122/70.  Impression:  Normal right carotid study.  I do not have available to me at this time a copy of the results of the lumbar puncture test.  What I can remember of the results that I reviewed with my neurologist, is that the results were inconsistent with either a viral infection or MS.

On an unspecified date, unknown period after vaccination, the patient fecal specimen was obtained to test for the rotavirus and the patient experienced acute gastroenteritis. The patient hospitalized between February 2013 and April 2015. Due to the delayed penta concordant 2nd dose, the patient missed last dose of rotarix, which led to missed dose (i.e incomplete course of vaccination).

Delayed vaccine administration was defined as vaccine administration at least 1 week after the recommended rotavirus vaccination schedule.

The author commented, ""Delayed pentavalent vaccine administration was clearly associated with missed rotavirus vaccination opportunity for the first dose alone. Children who received a delayed concordant dose of pentavalent vaccine were also more likely to miss a last dose of rotavirus vaccine as compared to children who had received concordant pentavalent dose on time, and findings were not confounded by age on admission, months between vaccine introduction and admission date, and sex. However, when restricting the cohort to children who had received first dose of rotavirus vaccine and pentavalent vaccine, there was no association between missed last dose of rotavirus vaccine and timeliness of concordant pentavalent dose in any country. This indicates that rotavirus vaccine last dose findings were driven primarily by missed rotavirus vaccine first doses."" The author concluded ""Rotavirus vaccine administration was timely among children enrolled at sentinel sites in these four early rotavirus vaccine introducing countries, and age restrictions had minimal impact on rotavirus vaccine use due to timely vaccine administration. In countries with less timely vaccine administration, disparities in coverage between rotavirus vaccine and pentavalent vaccine may be more prominent if age restrictions continue to be followed to some extent and this should be examined in future evaluations."".

The mother's concomitant medications included prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals, 1 tablet orally every day, from 18-Oct-2018 to 08-Feb-2019, for pregnancy and promethazine for nausea. The mother's medical history included nausea.  The mother's obstetrical history included three previous pregnancies: two live births and one spontaneous abortion. The mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation nor maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations. The mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The pregnancy status of the mother was collected and there were no complications noted.  The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) was 15-Jun-2018. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The estimated delivery date (EDD) was 22-Mar-2019 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was 05-Mar-2019.   On 18-Oct-2018, haemoglobin electrophoresis, spinal muscular atrophy screen and fibrosis mutation analysis were done and no major congenital malformation (MCM) were noted.

The subject's obstetrical history noted that the subject had 5 previous pregnancies which included three full term live births, one preterm live birth and one spontaneous abortion. No birth defects were reported. Also, the subject had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations. The subject did not have a prior history of use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The subject's medical history included hypothyroidism. The subject's concomitant medications included Prenatal Vitamins (mineral NOS, vitamin NOS) as a supplement.  The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 30-Nov-2018, estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) were reported as 06-Sep-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 24-Jan-2019, the subject underwent ultrasound scan, and no major congenital malformation was noted.

On 27-Aug-2019, approximately six months after vaccination, the subject developed oligohydramnios.   At gestational age of 39 weeks, the subject vaginally delivered live birth, female neonate. The neonate's birth weight was 3439 g, head circumference 35.5 cm and length 53.3 cm. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes).

The patient had no previous medical problems. There was no family history of autoimmune, ocular, or neurologic disorders.  On an unknown date, the patient was administered with unspecified Flu vaccine [quadrivalent inactivated flu vaccine, route of administration: intramuscular, dose, batch number and anatomical location: not provided] for an unknown indication.   On an unspecified date, one week after receiving a flu vaccine the patient developed bilateral vision loss and was diagnosed with bilateral optic neuritis.  The patient's identical twin received the same vaccination without subsequent changes in vision.  At presentation to the emergency department, her visual acuities were hand motion in the right eye and counting fingers in the left with no afferent pupillary defect (APD). Examination revealed severe optic disc swelling with vessel obscuration bilaterally and peripapillary hemorrhages on the left. There were no anterior chamber cells, vitreous cells, or macular exudates in either eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, orbits, and spinal cord with and without intravenous (IV) contrast showed increased T2/FLAIR signal and abnormal enhancement in the retrobulbar optic nerves bilaterally, but no white matter lesions in the brain or spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 1,000 red blood cells/mL, 5 nucleated cells (WBC)/mL, protein level of 23 mg/dL, and glucose level of 58 mg/dL. There were no oligoclonal bands, positive cultures, Lyme antibodies, aquaporin-4 antibodies, or evidence of any of the following by polymerase chain reaction in the CSF: Epstein�Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Serologic testing was also negative for culture growth, Lyme antibodies, and aquaporin-4 antibodies; white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were normal.  The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone.   After 5 days of IV methylprednisolone, visual acuities improved to 20/20, and she recognized 10/10 Ishihara color plates with each eye. The patient was discharged to home without a steroid taper.  Six days after her last dose of IV steroids, the patient experienced decreased vision in the left eye. Examination showed visual acuities of 20/25 in the right eye and no light perception in the left eye. There was a left APD.   Ophthalmoscopy showed mild atrophy of the right optic disc from her initial inflammation and swelling of the left optic disc. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer showed average thicknesses of 144 �m in the right eye and 203 �m in the left eye, consistent bilateral disc edema.   The patient was started oral prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day. Two weeks later, her visual acuities returned to 20/20 with normal color vision (14/14 Ishihara plates) in each eye. Optic disc swelling in the left eye had resolved, leaving mild pallor of both optic discs. The oral steroid dose was tapered over the subsequent 4 weeks without recurrence of vision loss. At her last follow-up evaluation (11 weeks after the influenza vaccination and 10 weeks after initial vision loss), neuro-ophthalmic examination was stable.  The patient has remained without recurrence off steroids over the past 2 years.  Per reporter, the divergent reactions to the influenza vaccine in their patient and patient's identical twin suggest that the interplay between environmental exposures and genetic predisposition in postinfluenza vaccination optic neuritis may be more complicated and warrants further research.  Company Comment: The patient experienced optic neuritis one week after vaccination with unspecified Flu vaccine. Chronology is plausible.

The mother's medical history included depression. Concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (mineral NOS, vitamins NOS), clonazepam and Effexor XR (venlafaxine hydrochloride).  The mother's obstetrical history noted that mother had two previous pregnancies with two spontaneous abortions. The subject's mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation and no relevant maternal and paternal medical history. The mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 23-Apr-2018. Estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected delivery date (CEDD) were 28-Jan-2019. The pregnancy was singleton.  On 07-Jun-2018, the mother underwent ultrasound and no major congenital malformations were noted.   On 16-Aug-2018, the mother underwent Quad screen and ultrasound and no major congenital malformations were noted.   On 17-Sep-2018, the mother underwent ultrasound and no major congenital malformations were noted.   On 08-Oct-2018, at gestational age at 24 weeks, the subject's mother was administered with Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, batch number: 252664, dose: 0.5ml, anatomical location, route of administration and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as fetal exposure during pregnancy) for immunization to Influenza virus.  On 06-Dec-2018, the mother underwent ultrasound and no major congenital malformations were noted.   at gestational age of 36.9 weeks, the mother vaginally delivered premature live birth, female neonate. The neonate's birth weight was 3459 g, head circumference 33 cm and length 50.8 cm. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes). No data was provided for Apgar score in 10 minutes. There was no major congenital malformation identified at birth.   The outcome of event �premature birth' was not reported.   The case is linked to 201904582, corresponding mother case.  Company comment: A female neonate patient experienced preterm birth, 3 months after maternal receipt of Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD at 24 weeks of gestation (considered as foetal exposure during pregnancy). Chronology seems plausible. Maternal medical history of two spontaneous abortions and concomitant use of clonazepam and Effexor XR confound causality. However, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and it is assessed as related. The event foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as unrelated per company's conventions.; Reporter's Comments: A female neonate patient experienced preterm birth, 3 months after maternal receipt of Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD at 24 weeks of gestation (considered as foetal exposure during pregnancy).

Next day patient went to school, complained that she was weak, that her vision was not right�seeing little things-- and started crying.   On 8/28 at around 12:38pm, took patient to ER visit due to the palpitations. All symptoms experienced were discussed, including ringing in the ears, with the doctor and upon discharge ER doctor recommended follow-up with doctor to possibly get a holter cardiac monitor a psychiatric consultation. On 8/29 went to follow-up with doctor after ER visit, again mentioned all the symptoms to the doctor including palpitations and that arm was sore/hurting at vaccination site. Doctor did not link any of the symptoms to the vaccination and gave order for labs and a holter cardiac monitor. Doctor also revoked the sports clearance that had been granted to the patient.  On 8/29 went to get labs including blood and urine samples; all came back normal.  Not sure, which day it was after the vaccination but patient woke up with a swollen arm and swollen help; she thought her allergy medication helped to control it. On 8/31, patient started wearing monitor until 9/9.   Patient went back to the same ER on 9/4 complaining of bad shortness of breath; the doctor still considered that it was related to panic attacks.  At the ER, heart monitor company (Cardiomedic) faxed results they had so far for review and they showed heart a little heart rate increase but not out of normal.  Contacted doctor to let them know they were back at the ER but did not have a follow-up appointment available until 9/9.   On 9/7, patient had difficulty breathing again so taken to doctor to get possibly a breathing treatment.   Per doctor, she could not give patient a breathing treatment and specified that the symptoms mentioned were not related to the vaccine.  Patient's parents were given the vaccine handouts that day�they had not received them before.   Patient reviewed the vaccine adverse event sheet and highlighted the following adverse events that were listed:   soreness, redness and swelling at site, shoulder and face, headache, feeling dizzy, vision problems, ringing in the ears, and difficulty breathing.

A 19-year-old-male patient developed generalized vaccinia (GV) (PT: Generalised vaccinia) and Epstein Barr Virus Infection/ mononucleosis (PT: Infectious mononucleosis), following the administration of ACAM2000 (smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine, live)   Case report: A 19-year-old presented to his aid station with concern for a spreading vesicular rash 9 days after a primary inoculation with the smallpox vaccine. The rash was limited to the inoculation site on his left shoulder. He had no medical history of eczema, atopic dermatitis, or other rashes and reported no systemic symptoms. His vitals also were within normal limits. A clinical diagnosis of inadvertent inoculation (also termed accidental infection) with satellite lesions was made, and he was discharged with counseling on wound care and close follow-up. Two days later, on post vaccination day 11, he presented with new symptoms of a headache, fever, chills, diffuse myalgia, sore throat, and spreading erythematous macules, papules, and vesicles on his arms, chest, abdomen, back, legs, and face. His vital signs were remarkable for tachycardia with heart rate of 100 bpm and a fever of 103 degree Fahrenheit (39.4 degree Celsius). He was sent to the emergency department with a presumed generalized GV diagnosis.   A complete blood count, liver function tests, and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Given his symptom of pharyngitis, a rapid strep test was performed. The test was negative, and a throat culture showed no growth. A mononucleosis screen also was performed and was positive. The patient was diagnosed with mononucleosis and GV. His condition improved, and his vital signs stabilized with conservative treatment without the need for vaccine immune globulin (VIG). He convalesced for 72 hours and was referred to dermatology on the following day. He was quarantined in a single occupancy barracks room until all lesions crusted over to address the concern for spread of the virus to non-immunized coworkers or family members.   On post vaccination day 12, the patient continued to be clinically well, and he remained afebrile. The dermatologist obtained a skin biopsy from a lesion on the patient's right shin. The biopsy demonstrated marked epidermal necrosis with peripheral keratinocytes showing ballooning degeneration and viral cytopathic changes consistent with GV. Antibody titers showing high levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) capsid IgM and IgG present confirmed mononucleosis infection within the past 6 months. The patient remained clinically well and was released from quarantine on post vaccination day 22 when all lesions crusted over.  Author's comment: The smallpox vaccination is unique among vaccinations. It is the only vaccine that is administered via inoculation with a bifurcated needle, requires regular follow-up care, and can be spread to casual contacts. It is important for any practitioner administering the smallpox vaccine to be aware of associated AEs. A greater knowledge of the unique challenges with the smallpox vaccine allows for better patient selection that eliminates those with conditions that impair their immune system and improves patient education.  Company' comment:The Company considers that the generalized vaccinia (GV) was probably related to the ACAM vaccination. Such widespread skin reaction to vaccine occurs due to virus dissemination beyond the initial inoculation site of small pox vaccine throughout systemic transmission. Mononucleosis is considered concurrent condition and present symptoms were probably due to a relapse or worsened due to the GV. Because the tests showed an onset of about six months, mononucleosis a concurrent infection and not considered as an adverse event. Symptoms are not coded as per MedDRA point to consider.

Patient to MD  9/17/19 12:11 PM  Hi Dr,  I visited the Ortho this morning about my shoulder pain. I asked Dr about the Shingrix vaccine and if there was a possibility of the vaccine being the culprit for the shoulder pain flare up. He said there are others who have come in with this same condition and he believes is related to the vaccine.

This case corresponds to result section reported in this literature article. The patient was the part of the Enhanced Pertussis Surveillance (EPS) as part of the Emerging Infections Program Network. The aim of the study was to characterize severe pertussis cases, defined as those that require hospitalization, and compare hospitalized and non-hospitalized pertussis patients, identify risk factors for hospitalization, and describe the clinical course and underlying health conditions of hospitalized pertussis patients. The patient had a concurrent history of human immunodeficiency virus infection. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication. On unspecified date, at least 14 days prior to cough onset, the patient had received unspecified tetanus, diphtheria & acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. [In this study, 15942 cases of pertussis were reported in the surveillance area, patients aged more or equal to 12 years were considered up to date if they had received Tdap. For this analysis, only documented vaccine doses administered at least 14 days prior to cough onset. Fewer hospitalized patients were up to date on pertussis-containing vaccines]. On unspecified date in between 1st January 2011 and 31st December 2015, at least 14 days after vaccination, the patient had the onset of cough and was admitted. The patient had an infection which was laboratory confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During the admission, the patient had diagnosed with the pneumonia, sepsis (not further described), and encephalopathy. The patient had the normal white blood cell (WBC) of 8.71 � 109/L. The patient had a respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation. On an unspecified date, the hospitalized pertussis patients died from their infection. It was unknown, whether the autopsy was performed or not. [In this study, pertussis cases were classified according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition. For hospitalized pertussis patients, defined as those admitted to an inpatient care facility, observation unit, or emergency department for more or equal to 24 hours as a result of pertussis infection. Among these cases, 15 427 occurred in patients treated as an outpatient and 515 occurred in patients who were hospitalized; 107 hospitalized patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Overall, the most common hospital admission diagnoses included cough, ""pertussis"", respiratory distress and or failure, bronchiolitis or bronchitis, and pneumonia. Among all hospitalized patients (515), the median length of time from onset to hospitalization was 11 days, ranging from 7 days in infants aged less than 2 months to 17 days in persons aged equal or more than 65 years. The median length of hospital stay was 3 (1.7-6.9 days) and ICU stay was 4 (2-9 days). The hospitalized patients received a macrolide antibiotic within 14 days of symptom onset, and had an infection that was laboratory confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Traditional pertussis clinical symptoms were more commonly reported in hospitalized patients symptoms included paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, whoop, cyanosis and apnea. Among patients who were tested during their hospitalization, 31 of 350 had a maximum white blood cell (WBC) count that surpassed 30 � 109/L (previously associated with an increased risk of pertussis-related infant deaths and 54 of 271 had a viral codetection (diagnosed through PCR, direct fluorescent antibody testing, culture, or rapid antigen tests). Overall, 127 of hospitalized pertussis patients developed pneumonia, developed new-onset seizures, and developed encephalopathy]. This case was considered as suspected vaccination failure as the vaccination schedule and time to onset were unknown. This case was considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and death. The author commented, ""Pertussis vaccination according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations is not only effective at preventing disease but has also been shown to reduce the clinical severity of pertussis illness. Although high amounts of missing vaccination information in adolescents and adults precluded our ability to fully assess this association in older age groups, a recent publication suggested that adolescents and adults vaccinated with Tdap have reduced incidence of post-tussive vomiting, a marker of more clinically significant illness. Thus, although vaccinated persons may still remain at risk for pertussis infection, these data highlight the role that pertussis vaccination plays in the prevention of severe and potentially life-threating infections, suggesting an added benefits of vaccination that goes beyond disease prevention. We are unable to determine whether certain underlying conditions are risk factors for severe pertussis or, rather, whether persons with these conditions are hospitalized at greater rates due to a perception of increased risk for severe disease"". The author concluded, ""Our analysis shows that severe pertussis infections that require hospitalization are not limited to infants; certain risk factors, such as key underlying medical conditions, may predispose an individual to more severe infections. Continued monitoring of pertussis hospitalizations through enhanced surveillance systems such as EPS will help better define populations at increased risk of severe disease in order to appropriately target and prioritize current and future pertussis prevention and control strategies. Individuals at the extreme ends of life may be the most vulnerable to severe pertussis infections, though hospitalization was reported across all age groups. Continued monitoring of severe pertussis infections will be important to help guide prevention, control, and treatment options"".

This case corresponds to result section reported in this literature article The patient was the part of the near real-time surveillance for GBS claims after influenza vaccination of insurance fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries using the updating sequential probability ratio test throughout the influenza seasons and SCRI analyses at the end of the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons. The aimed of this study was to evaluate this signal by conducting chart reviews in the 2015-2016 season followed by self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analyses of chart-confirmed and imputed cases. [In this study, for the 2015-2016 season SCRI analysis, they used chart-confirmed GBS cases. In 2016-2017 season they conducted SCRI analyses of the claims-based GBS cases and attributed GBS cases (based on the positive predictive value (PPV) of the GBS diagnoses obtained by chart reviews in the previous season). Of the 95 chart-confirmed GBS cases, they noted a history of antecedent respiratory or gastrointestinal illness within six weeks prior to onset of GBS symptoms in 47 charts, one of which had a documented history of Campylobacter jejuni. They identified claims for influenza vaccines and vaccines administered concomitantly (pneumococcal, hepatitis B, and tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines) using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. They conducted influenza infection adjustment using ��high"" and ��low"" influenza weeks, which were assigned as such using weekly oseltamivir prescription rates as well as use rates of rapid influenza tests (RIT) followed by an oseltamivir prescription within the subsequent two days]. On unspecified date, the patient had received unspecified 2015-2016 seasonal influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. [In this study, the vaccine type (high dose (HD) and standard dose (SD)), and presence of concomitant vaccination. The only HD vaccine administered in both seasons was the inactivated trivalent high dose vaccine (60 mg hemagglutinin per strain). The SD group included inactivated trivalent and quadrivalent (15 mg hemagglutinin per strain) vaccines A total of 13,366,005 insurance FFS influenza-vaccinated beneficiaries were observed for our SCRI analyses. Of these, 6,936,021 received the HD vaccine, 6,218,036 received the SD vaccines, and the remaining received other influenza vaccines (recombinant, intradermal, and cell-culture based) or only had general influenza vaccine codes but no specific codes for a vaccine type.]. On unspecified date between 2015 and 2016, in between the 1 and 42 days risk window, the patient had diagnosed with the guillain-barre syndrome (GBS) and fisher syndrome (FS) as per the Brighton case definition. [In this study, the primary and secondary risk windows were 1-42 and 8-21 days post-vaccination respectively. They defined exposure as a beneficiary's first influenza vaccination during the season, and outcome as the first occurrence of GBS in the inpatient setting during the post-vaccination window of interest. They used Brighton Collaboration's case definitions for GBS and Fisher Syndrome (FS), a variant of GBS, to classify these cases and considered cases classified as Brighton Level 1, 2, or 3 as ��chart-confirmed"" GBS cases. For the 2015-2016 season, our claims-based near real-time surveillance using the Updating Sequential Probability Ratio Test (USPRT) first revealed a GBS signal in week 16 of surveillance (as of 29th November 2015) among HD vaccines aged more or equal than 65 years as a risk of GBS in the 0 to 42 day window and as a risk of GBS in the 7 to 21 day window. Of note, in the 2015-2016 season, the 0 to 42 day and 7 to 21 day risk windows were used for near real-time surveillance; however, they changed the risk windows to 1 to 42 and 8 to 21 days post-vaccination for the SCRI analyses and near real-time surveillance for subsequent seasons to better align with the existing literature. In the subsequent weeks they observed a GBS signal in week 26 (as of February 2, 2016) for all beneficiaries vaccinated with all seasonal vaccines as a risk of GBS cases in the 0 to 42 day window. The demographic characteristics of the influenza-vaccinated beneficiaries and the GBS cases in the 2 risk windows. They obtained 133 charts. They found 158 claims-based GBS cases in the 84 days post-vaccination that met our study criteria. All cases except one were identified with the ICD-10 code. Three cases were observed after the January 22, 2016 cut-off, and they requested medical charts for the remaining 155 cases. They obtained 133charts. Of these, they confirmed 95 by chart review as GBS cases. Our analysis showed a PPV of an inpatient diagnosis of GBS in ICD-10. By chart abstraction they found that seven cases identified as GBS by claims had FS noted in the charts. However, none of these seven cases met the criteria for FS and four did not meet the criteria for GBS. Of the remaining three cases, they excluded one due to the subject being noted as less than 65 years of age. They included the remaining two cases in the SCRI analysis. Both cases occurred in the 1 to 42 day risk window; one also occurred in the 8 to 21 day window. Even though these two remaining cases were diagnosed by the physicians as FS, they both had limb weakness in addition to FS features and were thus classified as GBS.].  This case has been considered as serious due to the hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not provided. The authors commented, ""Our SCRI results did not show an excess GBS risk in the 1-42 day risk window either in the overall analysis or in any of the sub-analyses by vaccine type. For the secondary 8-21 day risk window, we found a statistically significant increased GBS for all seasonal vaccines. Our chart-confirmed analysis showed that the attributable risk in the secondary (8-21 day) risk window for all seasonal vaccines was slightly less than one excess GBS case per million vaccines, and that for the HD vaccine was slightly less than two excess cases of GBS per million vaccines. These findings are consistent with the risks noted on the package insert of influenza vaccines distributed in specific country. Our secondary analysis finding of a higher GBS risk among males and individuals aged more or equal to 75 years who received seasonal vaccines is consistent with existing literature. We considered the possibility that the difference may be related to egg-based versus recombinant influenza vaccine, which was included in our SD vaccine group"". The author concluded, ""we did not find an excess GBS risk in our primary analysis. The excess risk in some of our secondary analyses was close to what was expected; however, the slightly elevated GBS risk after all seasonal and HD vaccines, but not after standard dose vaccines is hypothesis-generating. This difference between HD and SD vaccines may be related to vaccine factors such as the amount of antigen or the antigen strains in various seasons or related to host factors. The risk of GBS after influenza disease is estimated to be much greater than the potential risk following influenza vaccine, ranging from four to almost 16 times higher, and the benefits of influenza vaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality heavily outweigh this risk. Influenza vaccines continue to be our best defense against influenza disease and the morbidity and mortality associated with it.""

For the 2015-2016 season, our claims-based near real-time surveillance using the Updating Sequential Probability Ratio Test (USPRT) first revealed a GBS signal in week 16 of surveillance (as of 29th November 2015) among HD vaccines aged more or equal than 65 years as a risk of GBS in the 0 to 42 day window and as a risk of GBS in the 7 to 21 day window. Of note, in the 2015-2016 season, the 0 to 42 day and 7 to 21 day risk windows were used for near real-time surveillance; however, they changed the risk windows to 1 to 42 and 8 to 21 days post-vaccination for the SCRI analyses and near real-time surveillance for subsequent seasons to better align with the existing literature. In the subsequent weeks they observed a GBS signal in week 26 (as of February 2, 2016) for all beneficiaries vaccinated with all seasonal vaccines as a risk of GBS cases in the 0 to 42 day window. The demographic characteristics of the influenza-vaccinated beneficiaries and the GBS cases in the 2 risk windows. They obtained 133 charts. They found 158 claims-based GBS cases in the 84 days post-vaccination that met our study criteria. All cases except one were identified with the ICD-10 code. Three cases were observed after the January 22, 2016 cut-off, and they requested medical charts for the remaining 155 cases. They obtained 133charts. Of these, they confirmed 95 by chart review as GBS cases. Our analysis showed a PPV of an inpatient diagnosis of GBS in ICD-10. By chart abstraction they found that seven cases identified as GBS by claims had FS noted in the charts. However, none of these seven cases met the criteria for FS and four did not meet the criteria for GBS. Of the remaining three cases, they excluded one due to the subject being noted as less than 65 years of age. They included the remaining two cases in the SCRI analysis. Both cases occurred in the 1 to 42 day risk window; one also occurred in the 8 to 21 day window. Even though these two remaining cases were diagnosed by the physicians as FS, they both had limb weakness in addition to FS features and were thus classified as GBS.].  This case has been considered as serious due to the hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not provided. The authors commented, ""Our SCRI results did not show an excess GBS risk in the 1-42 day risk window either in the overall analysis or in any of the sub-analyses by vaccine type. For the secondary 8-21 day risk window, we found a statistically significant increased GBS for all seasonal vaccines. Our chart-confirmed analysis showed that the attributable risk in the secondary (8-21 day) risk window for all seasonal vaccines was slightly less than one excess GBS case per million vaccines, and that for the HD vaccine was slightly less than two excess cases of GBS per million vaccines. These findings are consistent with the risks noted on the package insert of influenza vaccines distributed. Our secondary analysis finding of a higher GBS risk among males and individuals aged more or equal to 75 years who received seasonal vaccines is consistent with existing literature. We considered the possibility that the difference may be related to egg-based versus recombinant influenza vaccine, which was included in our SD vaccine group"". The author concluded, ""we did not find an excess GBS risk in our primary analysis. The excess risk in some of our secondary analyses was close to what was expected; however, the slightly elevated GBS risk after all seasonal and HD vaccines, but not after standard dose vaccines is hypothesis-generating. This difference between HD and SD vaccines may be related to vaccine factors such as the amount of antigen or the antigen strains in various seasons or related to host factors. The risk of GBS after influenza disease is estimated to be much greater than the potential risk following influenza vaccine, ranging from four to almost 16 times higher, and the benefits of influenza vaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality heavily outweigh this risk. Influenza vaccines continue to be our best defense against influenza disease and the morbidity and mortality associated with it.""

The patient was a part of cohort study that aimed to determine whether Partial Splenic Embolization (PSE) was safe and effective in the pediatric population.  The study was a retrospective review of a single-center experience for all patients ages 0 to 21 who underwent PSE for the management of portal hypertension (PHTN) between January 2010 and August 2017. The study presented the experience with the use of this modality in different pediatric populations with PHTN to better understand the rationale for safe and appropriate application of this treatment. [In this study, [In this study, recommended PSE to patients with bleeding tendencies that were not optimal candidates for an open surgical shunt or repeated endoscopies. This includes the following patient populations: Patients with baseline compromised respiratory function (ie, cystic fibrosis [CF]). 2. Patients with significant synthetic dysfunction that may progress to liver failure after shunting. 3. Patients with early signs of encephalopathy that could potentially worsen with increased portal systemic shunting. 4. Patients with abnormal right heart function that could develop cardiac decompensation or shunt failure. 5. Patients deemed to be marginal candidates for repeated anesthesia. 6. Patients with splenic vein thrombosis. 7. Patients with characteristics predicting poor wound healing or other surgical complications. 8. Patients with unfavorable anatomy, increased transhepatic resistance, or elevated right heart pressures to permit mesoportal shunting (Rex shunt)]. The patient had thrombocytopenia and/or recurrent variceal bleeding. The patient had portal hypertension, whose etiology was biliary atresia (BA), and the patient also noted to have evidence of varices before PSE which required endoscopic intervention. For this, the patient underwent endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) before PSE. The patient had significant splenomegaly before PSE. The decision to proceed with PSE was determined by the primary hepatologist and surgeon after careful discussion with both patient and family members regarding alternative approaches. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.   On an unspecified date, at least 2 weeks before PSE, the patient received unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B, unspecified meningococcal vaccines and unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 followed in 1 month by PPSV23 when feasible) (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown, batch number not provided for all), in order to reduce the risk of future infection by encapsulated organisms, should the procedure lead to a complication necessitating total splenectomy. The age of vaccination was not provided. It was reported that the patient received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis, typically with piperacillin/tazobactam, before the procedure to prevent infection of infarcted splenic tissue. This was continued for 5 to 7 days. On an unknown date, before PSE, the patient's platelet count was noted at 35�10E9/L (normal range not provided).   On an unspecified date between January 2010 and August 2017, at least 2 weeks after vaccination, the patient underwent PSE by interventional radiology under general anesthesia via percutaneous femoral artery approach under sterile conditions utilizing guidelines based on the Spigos technique to minimize complications. At the time of PSE, the patient was not actively bleeding. Diagnostic angiographies of the celiac axis and splenic arteries were obtained to determine the target splenic arterial branches, to identify accessory branches to other tissues from the splenic artery and to determine baseline splenic volume. Abdominal sonograms with doppler analysis of hepatic and splenic vessels were performed post procedure to assess vessel patency and the degree of intra-abdominal-free fluid. Arteriograms of partial splenic embolization (PSE), pre-embolization with capillary blush demonstrated splenomegaly and post-embolization with capillary blush revealed multiple defects before and after esophageal varices.   Information regarding patient's blood transfusions was not available. The patient was admitted to hospital after PSE for further observation and management. [In this study, patients received patient-controlled analgesia for pain control and to prevent splinting and associated pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia]. The patient did not develop infection with encapsulated organisms. Post-PSE, the patient's platelet count was 154�10E9/L. the antibiotics were converted to an oral regimen before hospital discharge. [In this study, criteria for hospital discharge included adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications, adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed splenomegaly and postembolization with necrotic areas surrounding the spleen. Three patients demonstrated complete resolution of varices. An additional 7 patients were noted to have a decrease in variceal grade].  On an unknown date, the patient was discharged fulfilling the criteria for hospital discharge that included (adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications), adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. The patient was followed-up in the outpatient hepatology clinic. Hematologic indices including white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were monitored. Imaging was repeated as indicated. The patient developed fever and abdominal pain and the patient was re-hospitalized. [In this study, 7 patients required readmission after initial discharge 2 of these patients were discharged only 1 day after PSE and returned the following day with fevers and abdominal pain with an unremarkable diagnostic evaluation].  Surveillance endoscopy was also performed 3 months after PSE to evaluate for persistent varices. Splenic function appeared to be preserved during years of follow-up in patient without increased incidence of infection.  This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The outcome of the event was not reported.  The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of fever and abdominal pain and Unspecified Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, unspecified meningococcal vaccine and unspecified pneumococcal (PCV13 followed by PPSV23) vaccine. The author stated ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunoprophylaxis against Streptococcus pneumoniae, H influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in all splenectomized patients. Complications of PHTN such as hypersplenism, variceal hemorrhage, and ascites can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Surgical interventions include shunting or splenectomy; however, overwhelming sepsis postsplenectomy is a pressing concern. PSE addresses portal hypertension regardless of etiology as definitive therapy. Most adverse effects following PSE are expected and can be managed conservatively. In our cohort we commonly observed fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis without evidence of infection. Pain was effectively controlled with intravenous and oral analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were avoided to minimize hemorrhage. In our experience, prophylactic antibiotics and limiting splenic reduction to no greater than 70% have avoided serious morbidity and mortality. In particular, there was no significant difference in the preprocedure platelet count between patients with and without recurrent thrombocytopenia. After PSE we noted a significant increase in platelets but to a lesser degree in patients who had recurrent hypersplenism. In our patients with esophageal varices, the combination of endoscopic ligation and PSE has been successful in controlling the progression of varices and decreasing the incidence of variceal hemorrhage.""  The author concluded ""our study supports that PSE is a safe, effective, semi-invasive alternative to splenectomy in pediatric patients with PHTN. The combination of EVL and PSE is effective treatment for esophageal and gastric varices (not amenable to simple band ligation). Reduced splenic volume and splenic venous return effectively decreased portal flow and pressure. PSE can be successfully performed in pre- and post-transplant transplant patients, and select cirrhotic and noncirrhotic pediatric patients. PSE appears to preserve functional spleen mass and avoids postprocedure accelerated liver disease or encephalopathy. In contrast to shunting, PSE can be effective even in the setting of elevated right-sided heart pressures. Further multicenter collaborative studies with larger and varied patient populations will need to be performed to substantiate our approach and better define patient populations that would benefit most from PSE, sequential PSE or combined interventions. Liver transplantation remains the ideal intervention for anyone with significant decompensated PHTN or advanced hepatic dysfunction"".  This is 1 of the 9 valid cases reported in this article.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the bacteremia was unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the bacteremia to be related to Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of bacteremia in a 7-year-old patient of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B, unspecified meningococcal vaccines and unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 followed in 1 month by PPSV23 when feasible) (manufacturer unknown for all) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to supplemental table 1 (patient 15) reported in this literature article.  The patient was a youngest patient of a cohort study that aimed to determine whether Partial Splenic Embolization (PSE) was safe and effective in the pediatric population.  The study was a retrospective review of a single-center experience for all patients ages 0 to 21 who underwent PSE for the management of portal hypertension (PHTN) between January 2010 and August 2017. The study presented the experience with the use of this modality in different pediatric populations with PHTN to better understand the rationale for safe and appropriate application of this treatment. [In this study, [In this study, recommended PSE to patients with bleeding tendencies that were not optimal candidates for an open surgical shunt or repeated endoscopies. This includes the following patient populations: Patients with baseline compromised respiratory function (ie, cystic fibrosis [CF]). 2. Patients with significant synthetic dysfunction that may progress to liver failure after shunting. 3. Patients with early signs of encephalopathy that could potentially worsen with increased portal systemic shunting. 4. Patients with abnormal right heart function that could develop cardiac decompensation or shunt failure. 5. Patients deemed to be marginal candidates for repeated anesthesia. 6. Patients with splenic vein thrombosis. 7. Patients with characteristics predicting poor wound healing or other surgical complications. 8. Patients with unfavorable anatomy, increased transhepatic resistance, or elevated right heart pressures to permit mesoportal shunting (Rex shunt)]. The patient had thrombocytopenia and/or recurrent variceal bleeding. The patient had portal hypertension, whose etiology was portal vein thrombosis (PVT) (no underlying liver disease) and the patient had a bleeding. The patient also noted to have varices before PSE. The patient had significant splenomegaly before PSE. The patient underwent surgical shunt before PSE. The decision to proceed with PSE was determined by the primary hepatologist and surgeon after careful discussion with both patient and family members regarding alternative approaches. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.   On an unspecified date, at least 2 weeks before PSE, the patient received unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B, unspecified meningococcal vaccines and unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 followed in 1 month by PPSV23 when feasible) (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown, batch number not provided for all), in order to reduce the risk of future infection by encapsulated organisms, should the procedure lead to a complication necessitating total splenectomy. The age of vaccination was not provided. It was reported that the patient received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis, typically with piperacillin/tazobactam, before the procedure to prevent infection of infarcted splenic tissue. This was continued for 5 to 7 days. On an unknown date, before PSE, the patient's platelet count was noted at 56�10E9/L (normal range not provided).   On an unspecified date between January 2010 and August 2017, at least 2 weeks after vaccination, the patient underwent PSE by interventional radiology under general anesthesia via percutaneous femoral artery approach under sterile conditions utilizing guidelines based on the Spigos technique to minimize complications. At the time of PSE, the patient was not actively bleeding. Diagnostic angiographies of the celiac axis and splenic arteries were obtained to determine the target splenic arterial branches, to identify accessory branches to other tissues from the splenic artery and to determine baseline splenic volume. Abdominal sonograms with doppler analysis of hepatic and splenic vessels were performed post procedure to assess vessel patency and the degree of intra-abdominal-free fluid. Arteriograms of partial splenic embolization (PSE), pre-embolization with capillary blush demonstrated splenomegaly and post-embolization with capillary blush revealed multiple defects before and after esophageal varices.   Information regarding patient's blood transfusions was not available. The patient was admitted to hospital after PSE for further observation and management. [In this study, patients received patient-controlled analgesia for pain control and to prevent splinting and associated pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia]. The patient did not develop infection with encapsulated organisms. Post-PSE, the patient's platelet count was 181�10E9/L. The antibiotics were converted to an oral regimen before hospital discharge. [In this study, criteria for hospital discharge included adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications, adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed splenomegaly and postembolization with necrotic areas surrounding the spleen. Three patients demonstrated complete resolution of varices. An additional 7 patients were noted to have a decrease in variceal grade].  On an unknown date, the patient was discharged fulfilling the criteria for hospital discharge that included (adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications), adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. The patient was followed-up in the outpatient hepatology clinic. Hematologic indices including white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were monitored. Imaging was repeated as indicated. The patient developed bacteremia and re-admitted 1 day after discharge secondary to Staphylococcus warneri treated with a change in oral antibiotic from amoxicillin/clavulanate to levofloxacin after sensitivities were reported.  [In this study, 7 patients required readmission after initial discharge 2 of these patients were discharged only 1 day after PSE and returned the following day with fevers and abdominal pain with an unremarkable diagnostic evaluation].  Surveillance endoscopy was also performed 3 months after PSE to evaluate for persistent varices. Splenic function appeared to be preserved during years of follow-up in patient without increased incidence of infection.    This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The outcome of the event was not reported.  The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of bacteremia and Unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, unspecified meningococcal vaccine and unspecified pneumococcal (PCV13 followed by PPSV23) vaccine. The author stated ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunoprophylaxis against Streptococcus pneumoniae, H influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in all splenectomized patients. Complications of PHTN such as hypersplenism, variceal hemorrhage, and ascites can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Surgical interventions include shunting or splenectomy; however, overwhelming sepsis postsplenectomy is a pressing concern. PSE addresses portal hypertension regardless of etiology as definitive therapy. Most adverse effects following PSE are expected and can be managed conservatively. In our cohort we commonly observed fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis without evidence of infection. Pain was effectively controlled with intravenous and oral analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were avoided to minimize hemorrhage. In our experience, prophylactic antibiotics and limiting splenic reduction to no greater than 70% have avoided serious morbidity and mortality. In particular, there was no significant difference in the preprocedure platelet count between patients with and without recurrent thrombocytopenia. After PSE we noted a significant increase in platelets but to a lesser degree in patients who had recurrent hypersplenism. In our patients with esophageal varices, the combination of endoscopic ligation and PSE has been successful in controlling the progression of varices and decreasing the incidence of variceal hemorrhage.""  The author concluded ""our study supports that PSE is a safe, effective, semi-invasive alternative to splenectomy in pediatric patients with PHTN. The combination of EVL and PSE is effective treatment for esophageal and gastric varices (not amenable to simple band ligation). Reduced splenic volume and splenic venous return effectively decreased portal flow and pressure. PSE can be successfully performed in pre- and post-transplant transplant patients, and select cirrhotic and noncirrhotic pediatric patients. PSE appears to preserve functional spleen mass and avoids postprocedure accelerated liver disease or encephalopathy. In contrast to shunting, PSE can be effective even in the setting of elevated right-sided heart pressures. Further multicenter collaborative studies with larger and varied patient populations will need to be performed to substantiate our approach and better define patient populations that would benefit most from PSE, sequential PSE or combined interventions. Liver transplantation remains the ideal intervention for anyone with significant decompensated PHTN or advanced hepatic dysfunction"".  This is 1 of the 9 valid cases reported in this article.

Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a patient aged between 22 and 63 years of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with unspecified quadrivalent influenza vaccine (manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.   The patient was a part of the study that aimed was to compare antibody titers against both circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains and egg-adapted influenza A (H3N2) strains in acute specimens from individuals with and those without influenza virus infection in the 2017-2018 season. During the severe 2017-2018 influenza season, a study of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among inpatients with acute respiratory illness as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sponsored Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) was performed. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided.

All 15 individuals with confirmed vaccine product information received vaccines containing inactivated egg grown virus; 10 received quadrivalent standard dose vaccines (9 vaccines were produced by GlaxoSmithKline, and 1 was produced by Seqirus), 3 received trivalent high dose vaccines (produced by Sanofi Pasteur), 1 received trivalent adjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus), and 1 received trivalent unadjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus)]. On an unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, between 27 November 2017 and 31 January 2018, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient developed acute respiratory illness and subsequently hospitalized. The patient was enrolled less than or equal to 10 days after illness onset during active influenza virus circulation. The patient's throat and nasal swab specimens were collected shortly for influenza virus identification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The patient was found influenza A(H3N2) Positive The patient's antibody titers were also measured with neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays was determined. The microneutralization (MN) egg propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK-egg) antibody titer was found 20, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 20, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Washington/16/2017 (WA) antibody titer was found 10, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was 10, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Maryland/53/2017 (MD) antibody titer was found 10, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Wisconsin/327/2017 (WI) antibody titer was found 10, neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 80 and NAI MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was found 160 in patient. The genetic characterization of Influenza A(H3N2) virus strains circulating in patient sample was also determined (results not provided). This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of influenza A (H3N2) infection and unspecified Quadrivalent influenza vaccine. However, the authors stated, ""This analysis of specimens from adults hospitalized with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection during the 2017-2018 influenza season demonstrated an antibody response specific to egg-adapted strains that was significantly higher among vaccinated individuals. In our study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus. Additionally, antibody titers against cell grown influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus were similar to those in unvaccinated individuals. In this study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus. In this study, antibody against the neuraminidase of influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014 virus and influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 virus was not associated with protection against infection. Although neuraminidase content was not standardized in influenza vaccines, it was observed that anti neuraminidase antibody titers were higher among vaccinated individuals, suggesting that some of the existing anti neuraminidase antibody in this population resulted from vaccination. The serum specimens in this study were collected at a single time point early during acute illness."" The authors concluded, ""The conclusions were limited by the inclusion of a small number of specimens from a single hospital. Because the severity of the 2017-2018 epidemic was evident early in the season, it was prioritized rapid serologic testing of the specimens that were available to date during the first half of the season. These 2 factors may limit the broad generalizability of the results; however, the influenza viruses that circulated locally overall and during the analysis period were similar to those that predominated nationwide during the same season. The small sample size also precluded the ability to perform additional subanalyses, to assess whether results might vary within specific age groups or by history of prior vaccination. In one sense, the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine appears to have worked as intended: vaccinated individuals had high antibody titers against the influenza virus strain included in the vaccine. The study adds to the evidence that egg adaptations in the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine strain elicited antibodies to epitopes not conserved in circulating strains. The degree to which this contributed to the marked severity of the 2017- 2018 season remains to be determined. Several vaccine products have been introduced into the vaccine market that are produced in cells and do not have the same emergent egg adaptations seen in recent influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strains. At this time, evidence for the effectiveness of these vaccines relative to those produced in eggs is limited because few head to head trials have been performed. Early data suggest that cell based vaccines have somewhat improved protection in clinical trials and in the community. Unfortunately, these vaccines are still dependent on selecting viruses that are close antigenic matches to those that will circulate and are subject to the limitations of annual strain selection time lines. This underscores the need for the development of the next generation of influenza vaccines that provide better, broader, and longer lasting protection.""

That pain lasted about 6 months and just went away on it's own.

At that time, I could not even lift my arm to dress myself, it was very painful but like I said it went away. This time, I felt it again and thought oh no, before when I would tell people of my reaction to it before they looked at me like I was weird. This time I googled it and found that there is such a thing now.  This is where I got the information to this site. The deltoid muscle can get pinched and can be very painful. I knew I was not crazy. I am having pain now everyday, as the day goes on my arm just gets painful, there are times when I have to literally lift my arm up with my other arm to move it while I'm in bed. I have muscle relaxers that I was given by my PCP for my lower back pain that I use when the pain is so bad on my arm  and then I can get some sleep.  I have read articles on it and have found that a MRI can be helpful in determining how bad it is. I have not gone to my Dr yet regarding this and it's just because I do not want to take the time to do all the visits that will probably be involved and also the cost of the MRI.

This case corresponds to supplemental table 1 (patient 13) reported in this literature article.  The patient was a youngest patient of a cohort study that aimed to determine whether Partial Splenic Embolization (PSE) was safe and effective in the pediatric population.  The study was a retrospective review of a single-center experience for all patients ages 0 to 21 who underwent PSE for the management of portal hypertension (PHTN) between January 2010 and August 2017 at New York. The study presented the experience with the use of this modality in different pediatric populations with PHTN to better understand the rationale for safe and appropriate application of this treatment. [In this study, [In this study, recommended PSE to patients with bleeding tendencies that were not optimal candidates for an open surgical shunt or repeated endoscopies. This includes the following patient populations: Patients with baseline compromised respiratory function (ie, cystic fibrosis [CF]). 2. Patients with significant synthetic dysfunction that may progress to liver failure after shunting. 3. Patients with early signs of encephalopathy that could potentially worsen with increased portal systemic shunting. 4. Patients with abnormal right heart function that could develop cardiac decompensation or shunt failure. 5. Patients deemed to be marginal candidates for repeated anesthesia. 6. Patients with splenic vein thrombosis. 7. Patients with characteristics predicting poor wound healing or other surgical complications. 8. Patients with unfavorable anatomy, increased transhepatic resistance, or elevated right heart pressures to permit mesoportal shunting (Rex shunt)]. The patient had thrombocytopenia and/or recurrent variceal bleeding. The patient had portal hypertension, whose etiology was portal vein thrombosis (PVT)(no underlying liver disease) and the patient had a bleeding. The patient also had variceal hemorrhage and the patient also noted to have varices before PSE. For the management of variceal hemorrhage, the patient underwent sclerotherapy rather than endoscopic variceal ligation before PSE. The patient had significant splenomegaly before PSE. The decision to proceed with PSE was determined by the primary hepatologist and surgeon after careful discussion with both patient and family members regarding alternative approaches. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.   On an unspecified date, at least 2 weeks before PSE, the patient received unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B, unspecified meningococcal vaccines and unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 followed in 1 month by PPSV23 when feasible) (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown, batch number not provided for all), in order to reduce the risk of future infection by encapsulated organisms, should the procedure lead to a complication necessitating total splenectomy. The age of vaccination was not provided. It was reported that the patient received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis, typically with piperacillin/tazobactam, before the procedure to prevent infection of infarcted splenic tissue. This was continued for 5 to 7 days. On an unknown date, before PSE, the patient's platelet count was noted at 15�10E9/L (normal range not provided).   On an unspecified date between January 2010 and August 2017, at least 2 weeks after vaccination, the patient underwent PSE by interventional radiology under general anesthesia via percutaneous femoral artery approach under sterile conditions utilizing guidelines based on the Spigos technique to minimize complications. At the time of PSE, the patient was not actively bleeding. Diagnostic angiographies of the celiac axis and splenic arteries were obtained to determine the target splenic arterial branches, to identify accessory branches to other tissues from the splenic artery and to determine baseline splenic volume. Abdominal sonograms with doppler analysis of hepatic and splenic vessels were performed post procedure to assess vessel patency and the degree of intra-abdominal-free fluid. Arteriograms of partial splenic embolization (PSE), pre-embolization with capillary blush demonstrated splenomegaly and post-embolization with capillary blush revealed multiple defects before and after esophageal varices.   Information regarding patient's blood transfusions was not available. The patient was admitted to hospital after PSE for further observation and management. [In this study, patients received patient-controlled analgesia for pain control and to prevent splinting and associated pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia]. The patient was noted to have recurrent variceal hemorrhage after PSE and started bleeding and subsequently underwent EVL intervention. The patient did not develop infection with encapsulated organisms. Post-PSE, the patient's platelet count was 188�10E9/L. The antibiotics were converted to an oral regimen before hospital discharge. [In this study, criteria for hospital discharge included adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications, adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed splenomegaly and postembolization with necrotic areas surrounding the spleen. Three patients demonstrated complete resolution of varices. An additional 7 patients were noted to have a decrease in variceal grade].  On an unknown date, the patient was discharged fulfilling the criteria for hospital discharge that included (adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications), adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. The patient was not re-hospitalized. The patient was followed-up in the outpatient hepatology clinic. Hematologic indices including white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were monitored. Imaging was repeated as indicated. Surveillance endoscopy was also performed 3 months after PSE to evaluate for persistent varices. Additionally, the patient underwent surgical shunt after post PSE and reason of surgical shunt was due to recurrent variceal hemorrhage. The time range from PSE to surgical shunt was 7.56 -27.72 months. Splenic function appeared to be preserved during years of follow-up in patient without increased incidence of infection.  This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.   The outcome of the event was not reported.  The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of recurrent variceal hemorrhage and Unspecified Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, unspecified meningococcal vaccine and unspecified pneumococcal (PCV13 followed by PPSV23) vaccine. The author stated ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunoprophylaxis against Streptococcus pneumoniae, H influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in all splenectomized patients. Complications of PHTN such as hypersplenism, variceal hemorrhage, and ascites can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Surgical interventions include shunting or splenectomy; however, overwhelming sepsis postsplenectomy is a pressing concern. PSE addresses portal hypertension regardless of etiology as definitive therapy. Most adverse effects following PSE are expected and can be managed conservatively. In our cohort we commonly observed fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis without evidence of infection. Pain was effectively controlled with intravenous and oral analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were avoided to minimize hemorrhage. In our experience, prophylactic antibiotics and limiting splenic reduction to no greater than 70% have avoided serious morbidity and mortality. In particular, there was no significant difference in the preprocedure platelet count between patients with and without recurrent thrombocytopenia. After PSE we noted a significant increase in platelets but to a lesser degree in patients who had recurrent hypersplenism. In our patients with esophageal varices, the combination of endoscopic ligation and PSE has been successful in controlling the progression of varices and decreasing the incidence of variceal hemorrhage.""  The author concluded ""our study supports that PSE is a safe, effective, semi-invasive alternative to splenectomy in pediatric patients with PHTN. The combination of EVL and PSE is effective treatment for esophageal and gastric varices (not amenable to simple band ligation).

The combination of EVL and PSE is effective treatment for esophageal and gastric varices (not amenable to simple band ligation). Reduced splenic volume and splenic venous return effectively decreased portal flow and pressure. PSE can be successfully performed in pre- and post-transplant transplant patients, and select cirrhotic and noncirrhotic pediatric patients. PSE appears to preserve functional spleen mass and avoids postprocedure accelerated liver disease or encephalopathy. In contrast to shunting, PSE can be effective even in the setting of elevated right-sided heart pressures. Further multicenter collaborative studies with larger and varied patient populations will need to be performed to substantiate our approach and better define patient populations that would benefit most from PSE, sequential PSE or combined interventions. Liver transplantation remains the ideal intervention for anyone with significant decompensated PHTN or advanced hepatic dysfunction"".  This is 1 of the 9 valid cases reported in this literature article.      Lab Comments: Lab test were performed on an unspecified date, The patient's hematologic indices including white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were monitored (result not provided). Imaging was repeated as indicated  (result not provided). Surveillance endoscopy was also performed 3 months after PSE to evaluate for persistent varices.

I looked within the vaccine insert under post market-experience on page 17 and found that his last visit and vaccine DTap/IPV/hib fit the time frame perfect.

On an unknown date, the patient received Flu vaccine at an unknown dose.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, h3n2 influenza and respiratory disorder were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, h3n2 influenza and respiratory disorder to be related to Flu vaccine.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a patient aged between 22 and 63 years of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to supplementary table 2 (subject 7) in this literature article. The patient was a part of the study that aimed was to compare antibody titers against both circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains and egg-adapted influenza A (H3N2) strains in acute specimens from individuals with and those without influenza virus infection in the 2017-2018 season. During the severe 2017-2018 influenza season, a study of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among inpatients with acute respiratory illness as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored program was performed. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not provided. [In this study, there were 18 individuals who had been vaccinated, and the specific influenza vaccine they received could be confirmed for 15. All 15 individuals with confirmed vaccine product information received vaccines containing inactivated egg-grown virus; 10 received quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines (9 vaccines were produced by GlaxoSmithKline, and 1 was produced by Seqirus), 3 received trivalent high dose vaccines (produced by Sanofi Pasteur), 1 received trivalent adjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus), and 1 received trivalent unadjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus)]. On an unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, between 27 November 2017 and 31 January 2018, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient developed acute respiratory illness and subsequently hospitalized. The patient was enrolled less than or equal to 10 days after illness onset during active influenza virus circulation. The patient's throat and nasal swab specimens were collected shortly for influenza virus identification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The patient was found influenza A(H3N2) Positive. The patient's antibody titers were also measured with neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays was determined. The microneutralization (MN) egg propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK-egg) antibody titer was found 320, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 57, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Washington/16/2017 (WA) antibody titer was found 20, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was 20, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Maryland/53/2017 (MD) antibody titer was found 20, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Wisconsin/327/2017 (WI) antibody titer was found 57, neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 160 and NAI MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was found 160 in patient. The genetic characterization of Influenza A(H3N2) virus strains circulating in patient sample was also determined (results not provided). This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of influenza A (H3N2) infection and unspecified influenza vaccine. However, the authors stated, ""This analysis of specimens from adults hospitalized with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection during the 2017-2018 influenza season demonstrated an antibody response specific to egg-adapted strains that was significantly higher among vaccinated individuals. In our study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus.Additionally, antibody titers against cell-grown influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus were similar to those in unvaccinated individuals. In this study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus. In this study, antibody against the neuraminidase of influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014 virus and influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 virus was not associated with protection against infection. Although neuraminidase content was not standardized in influenza vaccines, it was observed that anti-neuraminidase antibody titers were higher among vaccinated individuals, suggesting that some of the existing anti-neuraminidase antibody in this population resulted from vaccination. The serum specimens in this study were collected at a single time point early during acute illness."" The authors concluded, ""The conclusions were limited by the inclusion of a small number of specimens from a single hospital. Because the severity of the 2017-2018 epidemic was evident early in the season, it was prioritized rapid serologic testing of the specimens that were available to date during the first half of the season. These 2 factors may limit the broad generalizability of the results; however, the influenza viruses that circulated locally overall and during the analysis period were similar to those that predominated nationwide during the same season. The small sample size also precluded the ability to perform additional subanalyses, to assess whether results might vary within specific age groups or by history of prior vaccination. In one sense, the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine appears to have worked as intended: vaccinated individuals had high antibody titers against the influenza virus strain included in the vaccine. The study adds to the evidence that egg adaptations in the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine strain elicited antibodies to epitopes not conserved in circulating strains. The degree to which this contributed to the marked severity of the 2017- 2018 season remains to be determined. Several vaccine products have been introduced into the US vaccine market that are produced in cells and do not have the same emergent egg adaptations seen in recent influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strains. At this time, evidence for the effectiveness of these vaccines relative to those produced in eggs is limited because few head-to-head trials have been performed. Early data suggest that cell-based vaccines have somewhat improved protection in clinical trials and in the community. Unfortunately, these vaccines are still dependent on selecting viruses that are close antigenic matches to those that will circulate and are subject to the limitations of annual strain selection time lines. This underscores the need for the development of the next-generation of influenza vaccines that provide better, broader, and longer-lasting protection."" This is 1 of the 4 valid cases reported in the same literature article.

On an unknown date, the patient received Flu Seasonal QIV Dresden at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, less than a year after receiving Flu Seasonal QIV Dresden, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), h3n2 influenza (serious criteria hospitalization) and respiratory disorder (serious criteria hospitalization). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, h3n2 influenza and respiratory disorder were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, h3n2 influenza and respiratory disorder to be related to Flu Seasonal QIV Dresden.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a patient aged between 22 and 63 years of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with unspecified quadrivalent influenza vaccine (manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.   The patient was a part of the study that aimed was to compare antibody titers against both circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains and egg-adapted influenza A (H3N2) strains in acute specimens from individuals with and those without influenza virus infection in the 2017-2018 season. During the severe 2017-2018 influenza season, a study of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among inpatients with acute respiratory illness as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) was performed. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, the patient received unspecified quadrivalent influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not provided. [In this study, there were 18 individuals who had been vaccinated, and the specific influenza vaccine they received could be confirmed for 15. All 15 individuals with confirmed vaccine product information received vaccines containing inactivated egg-grown virus; 10 received quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines (9 vaccines were produced by GlaxoSmithKline, and 1 was produced by Seqirus), 3 received trivalent high dose vaccines (produced by Sanofi Pasteur), 1 received trivalent adjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus), and 1 received trivalent unadjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus)]. On an unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, between 27 November 2017 and 31 January 2018, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient developed acute respiratory illness and subsequently hospitalized. The patient was enrolled less than or equal to 10 days after illness onset during active influenza virus circulation. The patient's throat and nasal swab specimens were collected shortly for influenza virus identification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The patient was found influenza A(H3N2) Positive. The patient's antibody titers were also measured with neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays was determined. The microneutralization (MN) egg propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK-egg) antibody titer was found 160, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 80, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Washington/16/2017 (WA) antibody titer was found 40, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was 40, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Maryland/53/2017 (MD) antibody titer was found 40, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Wisconsin/327/2017 (WI) antibody titer was found 40, neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 80 and NAI MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was found 160 in patient. The genetic characterization of Influenza A(H3N2) virus strains circulating in patient sample was also determined (results not provided). This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of influenza A (H3N2) infection and unspecified Quadrivalent influenza vaccine. However, the authors stated, ""This analysis of specimens from adults hospitalized with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection during the 2017-2018 influenza season demonstrated an antibody response specific to egg-adapted strains that was significantly higher among vaccinated individuals. In our study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus. Additionally, antibody titers against cell-grown influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus were similar to those in unvaccinated individuals. In this study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus. In this study, antibody against the neuraminidase of influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014 virus and influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 virus was not associated with protection against infection. Although neuraminidase content was not standardized in influenza vaccines, it was observed that anti-neuraminidase antibody titers were higher among vaccinated individuals, suggesting that some of the existing anti-neuraminidase antibody in this population resulted from vaccination. The serum specimens in this study were collected at a single time point early during acute illness."" The authors concluded, ""The conclusions were limited by the inclusion of a small number of specimens from a single hospital. Because the severity of the 2017-2018 epidemic was evident early in the season, it was prioritized rapid serologic testing of the specimens that were available to date during the first half of the season. These 2 factors may limit the broad generalizability of the results; however, the influenza viruses that circulated locally overall and during the analysis period were similar to those that predominated nationwide during the same season. The small sample size also precluded the ability to perform additional subanalyses, to assess whether results might vary within specific age groups or by history of prior vaccination. In one sense, the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine appears to have worked as intended: vaccinated individuals had high antibody titers against the influenza virus strain included in the vaccine. The study adds to the evidence that egg adaptations in the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine strain elicited antibodies to epitopes not conserved in circulating strains. The degree to which this contributed to the marked severity of the 2017- 2018 season remains to be determined. Several vaccine products have been introduced into the vaccine market that are produced in cells and do not have the same emergent egg adaptations seen in recent influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strains. At this time, evidence for the effectiveness of these vaccines relative to those produced in eggs is limited because few head-to-head trials have been performed. Early data suggest that cell-based vaccines have somewhat improved protection in clinical trials and in the community. Unfortunately, these vaccines are still dependent on selecting viruses that are close antigenic matches to those that will circulate and are subject to the limitations of annual strain selection time lines. This underscores the need for the development of the next-generation of influenza vaccines that provide better, broader, and longer-lasting protection."" This is 1 of the 4 valid cases reported in the same literature article.      Lab Comments: On an unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, between 27 November 2017 and 31 January 2018, the lab test were performed.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, h3n2 influenza and respiratory disorder were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, h3n2 influenza and respiratory disorder to be related to Flu vaccine.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a patient aged between 22 and 63 years of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a part of the study that aimed was to compare antibody titers against both circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains and egg-adapted influenza A (H3N2) strains in acute specimens from individuals with and those without influenza virus infection in the 2017-2018 season. During the severe 2017-2018 influenza season, a study of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine among inpatients with acute respiratory illness as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) was performed. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not provided. [In this study, there were 18 individuals who had been vaccinated, and the specific influenza vaccine they received could be confirmed for 15. All 15 individuals with confirmed vaccine product information received vaccines containing inactivated egg-grown virus; 10 received quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines (9 vaccines were produced by GlaxoSmithKline, and 1 was produced by Seqirus), 3 received trivalent high dose vaccines (produced by Sanofi Pasteur), 1 received trivalent adjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus), and 1 received trivalent unadjuvanted vaccine (produced by Seqirus)]. On an unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, between 27 November 2017 and 31 January 2018, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient developed acute respiratory illness and subsequently hospitalized. The patient was enrolled less than or equal to 10 days after illness onset during active influenza virus circulation. The patient's throat and nasal swab specimens were collected shortly for influenza virus identification by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The patient was found influenza A(H3N2) Positive. The patient's antibody titers were also measured with neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays was determined. The microneutralization (MN) egg propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK-egg) antibody titer was found 160, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 20, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Washington/16/2017 (WA) antibody titer was found 10, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was 10, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Maryland/53/2017 (MD) antibody titer was found 10, MN MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Wisconsin/327/2017 (WI) antibody titer was found 10, neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK) antibody titer was found 10 and NAI MDCK-SIAT1 propagated A/Singapore/Infimh-16-0019/2016 (SG) antibody titer was found 10 in patient. The genetic characterization of Influenza A(H3N2) virus strains circulating in patient sample was also determined (results not provided). This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of influenza A (H3N2) infection and unspecified influenza vaccine. However, the authors stated, ""This analysis of specimens from adults hospitalized with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection during the 2017-2018 influenza season demonstrated an antibody response specific to egg-adapted strains that was significantly higher among vaccinated individuals. In our study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus.Additionally, antibody titers against cell-grown influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus were similar to those in unvaccinated individuals. In this study sample, this suggests that the antibody responses to vaccination in this population are highly specific to the egg-adapted strain, with little cross-reactivity to the circulating virus. In this study, antibody against the neuraminidase of influenza A/HongKong/4801/2014 virus and influenza A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 virus was not associated with protection against infection. Although neuraminidase content was not standardized in influenza vaccines, it was observed that anti-neuraminidase antibody titers were higher among vaccinated individuals, suggesting that some of the existing anti-neuraminidase antibody in this population resulted from vaccination. The serum specimens in this study were collected at a single time point early during acute illness."" The authors concluded, ""The conclusions were limited by the inclusion of a small number of specimens from a single hospital. Because the severity of the 2017-2018 epidemic was evident early in the season, it was prioritized rapid serologic testing of the specimens that were available to date during the first half of the season. These 2 factors may limit the broad generalizability of the results; however, the influenza viruses that circulated locally overall and during the analysis period were similar to those that predominated nationwide during the same season. The small sample size also precluded the ability to perform additional subanalyses, to assess whether results might vary within specific age groups or by history of prior vaccination. In one sense, the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine appears to have worked as intended: vaccinated individuals had high antibody titers against the influenza virus strain included in the vaccine. The study adds to the evidence that egg adaptations in the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine strain elicited antibodies to epitopes not conserved in circulating strains. The degree to which this contributed to the marked severity of the 2017- 2018 season remains to be determined. Several vaccine products have been introduced into the vaccine market that are produced in cells and do not have the same emergent egg adaptations seen in recent influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strains. At this time, evidence for the effectiveness of these vaccines relative to those produced in eggs is limited because few head-to-head trials have been performed. Early data suggest that cell-based vaccines have somewhat improved protection in clinical trials and in the community. Unfortunately, these vaccines are still dependent on selecting viruses that are close antigenic matches to those that will circulate and are subject to the limitations of annual strain selection time lines. This underscores the need for the development of the next-generation of influenza vaccines that provide better, broader, and longer-lasting protection."" This is 1 of the 4 valid cases reported in the same literature article.      Lab Comments: On an unspecified date, during 2017-2018 influenza season, between 27 November 2017 and 31 January 2018, the lab test were performed.

The patient was a part of cohort study that aimed to determine whether Partial Splenic Embolization (PSE) was safe and effective in the pediatric population.  The study was a retrospective review of a single-center experience for all patients ages 0 to 21 who underwent PSE for the management of portal hypertension (PHTN) between January 2010 and August 2017. The study presented the experience with the use of this modality in different pediatric populations with PHTN to better understand the rationale for safe and appropriate application of this treatment. [In this study, [In this study, recommended PSE to patients with bleeding tendencies that were not optimal candidates for an open surgical shunt or repeated endoscopies. This includes the following patient populations: Patients with baseline compromised respiratory function (ie, cystic fibrosis [CF]). 2. Patients with significant synthetic dysfunction that may progress to liver failure after shunting. 3. Patients with early signs of encephalopathy that could potentially worsen with increased portal systemic shunting. 4. Patients with abnormal right heart function that could develop cardiac decompensation or shunt failure. 5. Patients deemed to be marginal candidates for repeated anesthesia. 6. Patients with splenic vein thrombosis. 7. Patients with characteristics predicting poor wound healing or other surgical complications. 8. Patients with unfavorable anatomy, increased transhepatic resistance, or elevated right heart pressures to permit mesoportal shunting (Rex shunt)]. The patient had thrombocytopenia and/or recurrent variceal bleeding.   The patient had portal hypertension, whose etiology was autoimmune hepatitis (AI). The patient also noted to have evidence of varices before PSE. For this, the patient underwent endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) before PSE. The patient had significant splenomegaly before PSE. This patient was found to have a genetic predisposition to myelodysplastic-like syndrome and thrombocytosis. it was reported that Myelodysplastic-like syndrome has been associated with both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The decision to proceed with PSE was determined by the primary hepatologist and surgeon after careful discussion with both patient and family members regarding alternative approaches. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.   On an unspecified date, at least 2 weeks before PSE, the patient received unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B, unspecified meningococcal vaccines and unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 followed in 1 month by PPSV23 when feasible) (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown, batch number not provided for all), in order to reduce the risk of future infection by encapsulated organisms, should the procedure lead to a complication necessitating total splenectomy. The age of vaccination was not provided. It was reported that the patient received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis, typically with piperacillin/tazobactam, before the procedure to prevent infection of infarcted splenic tissue. This was continued for 5 to 7 days. On an unknown date, before PSE, the patient's platelet count was noted at 153�10E9/L and white blood cells count (WBC) was 1.4�10E9/L (normal range not provided).   On an unspecified date between January 2010 and August 2017, at least 2 weeks after vaccination, the patient underwent PSE by interventional radiology under general anesthesia via percutaneous femoral artery approach under sterile conditions utilizing guidelines based on the Spigos technique to minimize complications. At the time of PSE, the patient was not actively bleeding. Diagnostic angiographies of the celiac axis and splenic arteries were obtained to determine the target splenic arterial branches, to identify accessory branches to other tissues from the splenic artery and to determine baseline splenic volume. Abdominal sonograms with doppler analysis of hepatic and splenic vessels were performed post procedure to assess vessel patency and the degree of intra-abdominal-free fluid. Arteriograms of partial splenic embolization (PSE), pre-embolization with capillary blush demonstrated splenomegaly and post-embolization with capillary blush revealed multiple defects before and after esophageal varices.   Information regarding patient's blood transfusions was not available. The patient was admitted to hospital after PSE for further observation and management. [In this study, patients received patient-controlled analgesia for pain control and to prevent splinting and associated pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia]. The patient underwent EVL intervention post PSE. The patient did not develop infection with encapsulated organisms. Post-PSE, the patient's platelet count was 1335�10E9/L. the antibiotics were converted to an oral regimen before hospital discharge. [In this study, criteria for hospital discharge included adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications, adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed splenomegaly and postembolization with necrotic areas surrounding the spleen. Three patients demonstrated complete resolution of varices. An additional 7 patients were noted to have a decrease in variceal grade].  On an unknown date, the patient was discharged fulfilling the criteria for hospital discharge that included (adequate control of abdominal pain with oral medications), adequate oral intake/hydration, and absence of post procedure infection. The patient was followed-up in the outpatient hepatology clinic. Hematologic indices including white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts were monitored. Imaging was repeated as indicated. The patient developed extensive thrombosis and re-admitted to hospital. The extensive thrombosis of her splenic vein, portal vein, and inferior vena-cava (IVC) at the level of the renal veins necessitating thrombectomy and urgent splenectomy 9 days after PSE. This patient had normal transhepatic pressures with massive debilitating splenomegaly. The procedure was performed for compassionate reasons and an estimated 80% of the spleen was infarcted in a single procedure. Platelet levels peaked at an astonishing 2484�E109/L in this patient after PSE necessitating chronic antiplatelet therapy.  [In this study, 7 patients required readmission after initial discharge 2 of these patients were discharged only 1 day after PSE and returned the following day with fevers and abdominal pain with an unremarkable diagnostic evaluation]. Surveillance endoscopy was also performed 3 months after PSE to evaluate for persistent varices. Splenic function appeared to be preserved during years of follow-up in patient without increased incidence of infection.  This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization/serious per reporter. [In this study, Thrombosis included splenic vein, portal vein, and inferior vena cava at the level of the renal veins reported by the Institute.  The outcome of the event was not reported.  The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of thrombosis and Unspecified Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, unspecified meningococcal vaccine and unspecified pneumococcal (PCV13 followed by PPSV23) vaccine. The author stated ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunoprophylaxis against Streptococcus pneumoniae, H influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in all splenectomized patients. Complications of PHTN such as hypersplenism, variceal hemorrhage, and ascites can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Surgical interventions include shunting or splenectomy; however, overwhelming sepsis postsplenectomy is a pressing concern. PSE addresses portal hypertension regardless of etiology as definitive therapy. Most adverse effects following PSE are expected and can be managed conservatively. In our cohort we commonly observed fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis without evidence of infection. Pain was effectively controlled with intravenous and oral analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were avoided to minimize hemorrhage. In our experience, prophylactic antibiotics and limiting splenic reduction to no greater than 70% have avoided serious morbidity and mortality. In particular, there was no significant difference in the preprocedure platelet count between patients with and without recurrent thrombocytopenia. After PSE we noted a significant increase in platelets but to a lesser degree in patients who had recurrent hypersplenism. In our patients with esophageal varices, the combination of endoscopic ligation and PSE has been successful in controlling the progression of varices and decreasing the incidence of variceal hemorrhage.""  The author concluded ""our study supports that PSE is a safe, effective, semi-invasive alternative to splenectomy in pediatric patients with PHTN. The combination of EVL and PSE is effective treatment for esophageal and gastric varices (not amenable to simple band ligation). Reduced splenic volume and splenic venous return effectively decreased portal flow and pressure. PSE can be successfully performed in pre- and post-transplant transplant patients, and select cirrhotic and noncirrhotic pediatric patients. PSE appears to preserve functional spleen mass and avoids postprocedure accelerated liver disease or encephalopathy. In contrast to shunting, PSE can be effective even in the setting of elevated right-sided heart pressures. Further multicenter collaborative studies with larger and varied patient populations will need to be performed to substantiate our approach and better define patient populations that would benefit most from PSE, sequential PSE or combined interventions. Liver transplantation remains the ideal intervention for anyone with significant decompensated PHTN or advanced hepatic dysfunction"".  This is 1 of the 9 valid cases reported in this article.

Company comment: A 32-year-old female pregnant subject experienced candidiasis, urinary tract infection and premature delivery after receipt of Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD. Chronology seems plausible for the events of candidiasis and urinary tract infection while for premature delivery remains unsuggestive. UTIs are common during pregnancy, because the growing uterus makes pressure on the bladder and urinary tract. Candida infections are also frequent during pregnancy. According to one study, about 20 percent of women have Candida yeast in their vagina normally. That number goes up to 30 percent during pregnancy. Although causality was highly confounded, causal role of the suspect vaccine cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related for all 3 events. Vaccine exposure during pregnancy assessed as unrelated per company's conventions.; Reporter's Comments: A 32-year-old female pregnant subject experienced candidiasis, urinary tract infection and premature delivery after receipt of Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD.

The mother was a 38-year-old, adult female pregnant subject of body weight: 286 lbs, height: 65 inches and body mass index (BMI): 47.6 enrolled in a study on pregnancy outcomes in women immunized with seasonal cell culture influenza trivalent (TIVc) or quadrivalent (QIVc) vaccine during pregnancy.  The mother's obstetrical history included 6 previous pregnancies with 1 full term live birth, 1 preterm birth, 2 spontaneous abortions and 2 stillbirths. The mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations.   The mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) was 18-Jun-2018, estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was 10-Mar-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton.  The mother's current conditions included gestational diabetes, obesity, chronic hypertension, asthma, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), shortness of breath and acid reflux. The mother's concomitant medications included prenatal vitamins (minerals nos, vitamins nos) for pregnancy, Albuterol (salbutamol) for shortness of breath, Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) for history of preterm birth, Clatirine (loratadine) for allergies and Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride) for acid reflux.  On 02-Aug-2018, the mother underwent cystic fibrosis mutation analysis and spinal muscular atrophy test and no major congenital malformation (MCM) was noted.  On 06-Aug-2018, the mother underwent ultrasound scan and no MCM was noted.  On 16-Aug-2018, the mother underwent Qnatal test and no MCM was noted.  On 24-Sep-2018, the mother underwent ultrasound scan and no MCM was noted.  On 08-Oct-2018, at 16 weeks of gestation, the mother was administered with Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD (influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, batch number: 252664, route of administration, anatomical location, expiration date: not reported) (explicitly coded as foetal exposure during pregnancy) for influenza immunisation.  On 10-Jan-2019, 17-Jan-2019, 25-Jan-2019, 31-Jan-2019 and 07-Feb-2019, the mother underwent non-stress test and no MCM was noted.  On 08-Feb-2019, the mother underwent ultrasound scan and MCM was noted.  On 11-Feb-2019 and 13-Feb-2019, the mother underwent non-stress test and no MCM was noted.  On 18-Feb-2019, the mother underwent ultrasound scan and no MCM was noted.  On 19-Feb-2019, four months and eleven days after vaccination, at 37.3 weeks gestation, the mother gave a live birth to a male neonate by vaginal delivery. The neonate's birth weight was 2268 grams (explicitly coded as low birth weight baby), head circumference 32.4 centimetres and body length 45.7cm. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes. APGAR score was not reported for 10 minutes.   On the same date, major congenital malformation was noted: isomerism, stomach and gallbladder on left.   At the time of initial report, outcome of the isomerism, stomach and gallbladder on left and low birth weight baby was not reported.   The reported did not provide causality and seriousness criteria.  This case is linked to 201904749, the corresponding mother report.  Company Comment: Reportedly, the male neonate subject was delivered as low birth weight baby with heterotaxia after foetal exposure during pregnancy, at gestation age of 16 weeks, with the suspect product Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD. Chronology is plausible for the event low birth weight baby. For the event heterotaxia temporal relationship is implausible because product was administered after organs of digestive system have already positioned themselves. Mother's medical history of gestational diabetes, obesity, chronic hypertension and asthma may have contributed to development of the events. Causality was confounded by therapy with multiple concomitant medications. Foetal exposure during pregnancy and heterotaxia is assessed as not related. For the event low birth weight baby, causal role of the suspect product cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related.; Reporter's Comments: Reportedly, the male neonate subject was delivered as low birth weight baby with heterotaxia after foetal exposure during pregnancy, at gestation age of 16 weeks, with the suspect product Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD.

A 35 year old female experienced seizures like episode (PT: Seizure like phenomena), flu-like symptoms (PT: Influenza like illness), nausea (PT: Nausea), vomiting (PT: Vomiting), migraine (PT: Migraine), following the administration of BioThrax.  The consumer claimed to have suffered progressively worse symptoms after anthrax vaccinations in December 2017, April 2018 and August 2018. It was reported that after the first vaccine, she experienced flu-like symptoms including headaches, sweats and coughing. After the second shot, she experienced nausea, vomiting and migraines, in addition to her prior symptoms. She also received emergency room treatment for migraines during this period.  The progressively worsening reactions to the first two vaccines led the consumer to withdraw her informed consent to the third administration of the vaccine, and she repeatedly requested a waiver from vaccination from the doctor, her patient advocate, and her chain of command. Although she received a week-long delay in vaccine, she did not obtain a waiver.  After the compulsory administration of the third anthrax vaccine, she developed nausea within a day. More symptoms developed over the course of weeks resulting in multiple overnight stints at the hospital. Medical staff instructed her and her husband, to wait out the reaction at home and avoid seeking treatment, as reported by the consumer. But when she became non-responsive during episodes of seizure-like shaking, her husband paid out-of-pocket for emergency room treatment. The seizure-like episodes continued for at least three weeks after the administration of the vaccine.   Outcome of the reported events was unknown at the time of report.

The paperwork she was given regarding the vaccine just indicated Dtap vaccine, with no additional information regarding manufacturer, etc. She got very sick. Her symptoms did not improve over time. She felt exhausted and toxic. She had chills and hot flashes. Her baby died at 3 1/2 weeks later.    Tuesday 8/27/2019:   I went to my normal, scheduled prenatal visit for my 32 week check-up. I was healthy, feeling good and strong. My OB Dr suggested I have the Dtap vaccine. He told me about the side effects. I told him I didn?t want it, that I don?t like taking any medicines or drugs and was worried about the side effects on my baby. I said that I did not have it for my two other pregnancies and everything went well, no problem. He told me it was necessary, not only to protect my baby but to protect the other babies in the hospital when I gave birth. He said all the other moms were getting it. So I said okay. They gave me the vaccine.   Wednesday 8/28/19:  The next day, Wednesday, I woke up feeling really sick. I felt like I had a fever, but I didn?t, though I was having hot flashes. My arm was very sore. I couldn?t raise it. It hurt too much to sleep on. I felt exhausted. I had a sore throat and runny nose. The injection site on my arm was very painful, and felt numb. Couldn?t sleep on it. painful inside. The sickness never got better. It didn?t go away. I just took things day by day, thinking I would feel better soon.   Thursday 9/12/19:  I went in for my next prenatal appointment, my 34 week check-up. I told the doctor about my symptoms since they gave me the vaccine injection. He said it was normal and maybe I had a cold or flu. My body still felt very weird, tired, sick, weak, hot flashes, chills. It never went away. We scheduled a routine ultra sound for Sept 18th. At 20 weeks pregnant, the routine ultrasound had shown a possible low lying placenta.   Wednesday 9/18/19:  I had the ultrasound. It showed no problem. The placenta was in the right position and everything was normal. Everything was good. I heard the baby?s heartbeat. It was strong and good. No problems. But I was still feeling sick.   Sunday 9/22/19:  The baby wasn?t moving. I felt something was wrong. I went to the emergency that was close to my house. They did an ultrasound and found that there was no heartbeat. They said the baby was dead. They told me to go home and rest. I was almost 36 weeks. They said to call my doctor and schedule an appointment with him at Hospital for the next day.   Monday 9/23/19: I checked into Hospital. I saw Dr. He induced labor in the afternoon.          Tuesday:  I gave birth near 5 pm, a baby girl. She weighed 5 lbs 4 oz. No cord wrapped around her neck. No bleeding. Everything seemed very normal. She looked perfect, no abnormalities and a good size for 36 weeks. They put her on my chest. She stayed with me until I left the next day afternoon   They asked if I wanted an autopsy. They said it would be helpful to understand what happened and why the baby died. I agreed. The baby is now at Hospital undergoing the autopsy.  Wednesday 9/25/19: I checked out of hospital and went home.

0837070,09/30/2019,NC,29.0,29,,M,,"YEL-AVD (Yellow Fever associated viscerotropic disease) Patient states he was in his normal state of health of 23 Aug 2019 when he received 3 vaccines as part of his immunization requirements to include AVA #1, Typhoid and YF-Vax. He tolerated the vaccines well without any immediate adverse reactions. Within a few hours, he developed bilateral shoulder soreness that lasted about 3 days before resolving. He then did fine until Monday, 2 Sep when he awoke with some subtle left sided chest discomfort. Patient describes the chest discomfort began as a tugging/pulling sensation in his left chest. The pain progressed the following day and began to have associated dyspnea which was worse when lying down or when taking a deep breath. His symptoms continued to worsen and he sought care in the ED on 6 Sep 19. There he was noted to have a (+) D-dimer and CTPA done which did not reveal a PE but did show a small -moderate sized left-sided pleural effusion. In addition, he was noted to have an elevated creatinine and liver associated enzymes. He was hemodynamically stable, oxygenationg at 98% on RA and afebrile in the ED. He also endorses some chills and night sweats that developed during this time. He notes having daily headaches, as well. He further describes his chest pain as a constant dull pain 4 out of 10 in intensity but with acute excaerbations of a sharp pain (9 out of 10) with deep inspiration or lying down. Upon presentation today, he states his symptoms are all resolved other than rare episodes of substernal chest discomfort that occur at rest and resolve within a couple minutes, which he notes as distinctly different than his original pain and dyspnea.He denies any associated nausea, vomiting or diarrhea associated with his symptoms, but did endorse some LH associated with his dyspnea. He denies any recent travel and has never been outside the country. No high risk sexual encounters, etc. He denies a history of atopy/allergies. He received all routine childhood vaccines without any adverse reactions. Patient denies any other known adverse events following immunizations. Patient states he tolerates ingestion of eggs and gelatin and denies any known adverse reactions to latex, neomycin, polymixin, streptomycin, thimerosal, yeast, or formaldehyde.  Patient with clinical history and laboratory findings most consistent with Yellow fever vaccine associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). This is a rare Adverse Event Following Immunizations (AEFI) that was first described in 2001. It is reported to occur in 0.3 per 100,000 vaccines and is exclusively seen in patients receiving the YF-Vax for the first time, typically occurring within 1-8 days following vaccination but has been reported as far out as 18 days (patient's symptoms began at 10 days out from vaccination). YEL-AVD mimics naturally acquired yellow fever disease with the vaccine virus proliferating and disseminating throughout the patient's tissues. YEL-AVD is defined as acute multiple organ system dysfunction that occurs following vaccinization; it can range from relatively mild multi-system disease to severe multiple organ system failure and death. Initial symptoms of YEL-AVD are nonspecific including fever, headache, malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; as it progresses it can include thrombocytopenia, elevation of transaminases, bilirubin and creatinine; less frequent manifestations include rhabdomyolysis and DIC. YEL-AVD is fatal in more than 60% of reported cases. Unfortunately, patient has no baseline CMPs/BMPs to compare his elevated LAEs and creatinine to. However, his LAEs are already trending down. The patient had multi-system organ involvement to include pleural effusion with dyspnea, elevated liver associated enzymes and acute kidney injury, elevated fibrin degradation products, as well as headaches. I suspect that patient will meet Brighton Collaboration case definition for viscerotrophic disease (level 2 of diagnostic certainty) with elevated Fibrin Degradation Products (elevated D-dimer) as well as a creatinine >/= 1.5 times his baseline value. (baseline value pending but suspect as patient convalesces his creatinine will decrease to less than 1 which will then meet this criteria). Interestingly, several cases of YEL-AVD have involved a history of autoimmune disease or diseases with potential autoimmune etiology. The literature includes 3 patients with SLE, 2 with Addison's disease, 1 with Crohn's disease, 1 with PMR and hypothyroidism, 1 with UC and 1 with myasthenia gravis. This patient has known mild eosinophilia with recent striae and weight gain, as well as some white and blue color changes to his digits. As suggested by his pulmonologist it is prudent to rule out Addison's disease as well as CVD given the literature and patient's history. No history of immunodeficiency, but given YEL-AVD can be associated with immunodeficiency will rule out common immunodeficiency with screening flow cytometry and quantitative Immunoglobulin levels; of note, patient denies a history of thymectomy or myasthenia gravis. Patient should not receive YF-Vax in the future but would not have an indication for such anyways. Patient may receive AVA and Typhoid as needed in the future but would consider dosing them in isolation from other vaccines.

INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ADMINISTRATION (mL Omnipaque 350): 100  DOSE REPORT (Total DLP mGy*cm): 879    FINDINGS:    There is a region of fat stranding that measures approximately 2.9 x   1.5 cm centered about a left IIB lymph node which measures   approximately 4 mm. In the left submandibular area there is another   approximately 4 mm level IB lymph node at the center of a 1.6 x 2.4   cm area of fat stranding.  There is adjacent overlying asymmetric   thickening of the left platysma.  A few additional mildly prominent   left cervical chain lymph nodes are also present, none of which are   pathologically enlarged.    There are no pathologically enlarged right cervical lymph nodes or   areas of surrounding fat stranding.    The nasopharynx and oropharynx are unremarkable.  There is a cystic   focus along the anterior right aspect of the epiglottis which   measures 7 x 4 mm in greatest axial dimension likely representing a   vallecular cyst as it encroaches into the right vallecula.  The   airway remains patent.    There is mild multifocal calcific atherosclerosis.    1.3 cm lipoma overlying the superior medial left trapezius.    Lung apices are clear.

CT SOFT TISSUE NECK W CONTRAST - Final result (09/16/2019 5:29 PM) Procedure Note Interface, Radiology Results In - 09/17/2019 10:54 AM  CT NECK WITH CONTRAST  HISTORY: R22.1; Localized swelling, mass and lump, neck COMPARISON: PET scan 12/20/2018, ultrasound 9/13/2019 TECHNIQUE: Spiral CT of the neck was performed following the intravenous administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were generated. INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ADMINISTRATION (mL Omnipaque 350): 100 DOSE REPORT (Total DLP mGy*cm): 879  FINDINGS:  There is a region of fat stranding that measures approximately 2.9 x 1.5 cm centered about a left IIB lymph node which measures approximately 4 mm. In the left submandibular area there is another approximately 4 mm level IB lymph node at the center of a 1.6 x 2.4 cm area of fat stranding. There is adjacent overlying asymmetric thickening of the left platysma. A few additional mildly prominent left cervical chain lymph nodes are also present, none of which are pathologically enlarged.  There are no pathologically enlarged right cervical lymph nodes or areas of surrounding fat stranding.  The nasopharynx and oropharynx are unremarkable. There is a cystic focus along the anterior right aspect of the epiglottis which measures 7 x 4 mm in greatest axial dimension likely representing a vallecular cyst as it encroaches into the right vallecula. The airway remains patent.  There is mild multifocal calcific atherosclerosis.  1.3 cm lipoma overlying the superior medial left trapezius.  Lung apices are clear. Status post left temporoparietal craniotomy with an area of encephalomalacia the left temporal lobe. No air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses or mastoid air cells. Moderate degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Small hypodense nodules in the thyroid.  IMPRESSION:  Areas of fat stranding centered around two lymph nodes deep to the left sternocleidomastoid mastoid and in the left submandibular region as described in the findings. Findings likely reflect an inflammatory or infectious etiology given adjacent enlargement of the musculature and fat stranding. However, malignancy, possibly lymphoma or metastatic disease, cannot be excluded and follow-up imaging is recommended after treatment to ensure resolution.  I, have reviewed the images and verify the above interpretation on 9/17/2019 10:52 AM.

I knew the arm pain was due to shot, I did not know where the other symptoms came from or why. From that day forward, my teeth became extremely sensitive to touch and eating food became a painful event. I did not call the doctor, because I had no idea this was related. On June 29th I went to urgent care as my tongue swelled up so bad I couldn't open my mouth except to swallow small amounts of food and water. The urgent care said to go to ER as this could be life threatening. ER said it was an infection of the salivary gland involving the lymph nodes. I was given a prescription for Keflex(?) and told to follow up with the doctor. I spent the next 10 days sick and in pain. I finally returned to work on July 8th. On August 10th I returned to Urgent Care and said I felt horrible. Everything from my neck up hurt and it kept moving around. The doctor said he had never seen this before and didn't know what to do. He gave me a prednisone shot and sent me home.   I finally made an appointment with my primary for August 30th. She referred me to an infectious disease specialist and to a neurologist.

I went to bed and woke up and threw up at about 1:00pm.   I was awake until at least 4 feeling very thirsty, a bit dizzy, light headed and in general sick.  I was extremely thirsty and got up on the hour and drank 8 to 10 oz of water until about 4 am or so.    I slept then for a while and woke up again around 7 am or so, by then my stomach and cramps were ok but then I had a little ringing in the left hear and had a low grade head ache.    I called the Dr. around the time the office opened and spoke with the nurse and ate a breakfast cookie.    We decided that I was much better than during the night but that I should get gatorade or coconut milk to replace electrolytes.  Over the next couple of hours I drank 2 cans of coconut milk ,stayed in bed feeling like I had the flu and slept pretty much all day until I got up and had rice when my husband had dinner.    The next day, I felt like I had a mild flu and was up and out of bed all day.  I took my temperature with a mercury oral themometer just once and it read 101.2 at about 7 am.   Usually I would be 98 or a little below.   The following day I felt a bit better yet.     It is now a week out on Wed.   Except for my stomach and intestines getting back to normal, I feel fine.  Except, I went out to dinner last night, had a substantial meal and had one liquid stool and one throwing up episode.  Because , I feel like I should be fine, I saw my Dr. today who ran some blood work to make sure that nothing else is brewing along with this ""reaction.""  Temperature at the Dr. office was 98.

The patient was the part of the observational study that aimed to investigate adverse event (AE) reports following the adenovirus vaccine submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). They searched the VAERS database for reports among persons who received adenovirus vaccine during 1st October 2011 through 31st July 2018 including participants in a military observational study. [In this study, they identified those reports filled from 24th October 2011 to 5th October 2012, an FDA-mandated, post marketing military observational study was conducted using the database. This study compared 100,000 recruits exposed to the adenovirus vaccine with a historical unexposed cohort and identified statistical signals for psoriasis, anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions as emergent AEs possibly related to vaccination. During the study period, VAERS received a total of 100 reports following adenovirus vaccine; among all reports, the earliest vaccination date with the adenovirus vaccine the study identified was November 9, 2011]. The patient was from the military observational study. The patient had a past history of anaphylaxis following Tdap and hepatitis A vaccines (i.e., a missed contraindication for Tdap). No information on patient's family history or concomitant condition was provided. On unspecified date, the patient had received unspecified inactivated poliovirus (IPV), unspecified inactivated influenza (IIV), unspecified meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) and unspecified tetanus, diphtheria & acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) vaccines and unspecified adenovirus (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided for all). The age of vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date between 1st October 2011 through 31st July 2018, unknown period after vaccination, the patient presented to the hospital with the episode of anaphylaxis. [In this study, The main diagnosis for each report was categorized into a MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) grouping. Reports suggestive of anaphylaxis or GBS were further classified using the Brighton Collaboration criteria or a physician's diagnosis. Reports are classified as serious based on the Code of Regulations if one of the following is reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability, or congenital anomaly]. This case has been considered as serious due to the hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. [In this study, each of the patients was treated with epinephrine, antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy]. The outcome of event was not reported.  The author commented, ""We identified eight reports of anaphylaxis following adenovirus vaccine classified as serious and on review of medical records all were identified as participants in the military observational study. In two patients the anaphylaxis was considered as possibly related to vaccines. In addition, 95 percent of the adenovirus vaccine reports documented co-administration of other vaccines and 50 percent reported co-administration of penicillin G (or other antibiotic if allergic to penicillin) according to standard protocol in this military population. The investigators of the earlier military observational study also commented that concurrent vaccine exposures in the recruit population was an important limiting factor for attributing the statistical signaling outcomes including psoriasis, anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions as possibly related to the vaccine"". The author concluded ""The reporting rate for serious AEs was higher than with other vaccines administered in the comparison military recruit population (39 percent vs 18 percent however, we identified no unexpected or concerning pattern of adenovirus vaccine AEs. Co-administration of vaccines and IM Pen G was commonly reported in this military population. These exposures may have contributed to the GBS and anaphylaxis outcomes observed with the adenovirus vaccine. Future adenovirus vaccine safety studies in a population without these co-administrations would be helpful in clarifying the vaccine's safety profile"".

On an unknown date, 1 day after receiving dTpa vaccine and Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine (potential Menveo) and an unknown time after receiving LIVE ATTENUATED INFLUENZA VACCINE, the patient experienced anaphylaxis (serious criteria GSK medically significant and other: as per reporter). On an unknown date, the outcome of the anaphylaxis was unknown.   The reporter considered the anaphylaxis to be possibly related to dTpa vaccine and Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine (potential Menveo).  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of anaphylaxis in a patient of unspecified age and gender who was vaccinated with unspecified live attenuated influenza (LAIV); unspecified meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and unspecified tetanus, diphtheria & acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) vaccines and unspecified adenovirus vaccine (manufacturer unknown for all vaccines) for prophylaxis.  The patient was the part of the observational study that aimed to investigate adverse event (AE) reports following the adenovirus vaccine submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). They searched the VAERS database reports among persons who received adenovirus vaccine during 1st October 2011 through 31st July 2018 including participants in a military observational study. [In this study, they identified those reports filled from 24th October 2011 to 5th October 2012, a post marketing military observational study was conducted using the Medical Surveillance System database. This study compared 100,000 recruits exposed to the adenovirus vaccine with a historical unexposed cohort and identified statistical signals for psoriasis, anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions as emergent AEs possibly related to vaccination. During the study period, VAERS received a total of 100 reports following adenovirus vaccine; among all reports, the earliest vaccination date with the adenovirus vaccine the study identified was November 9, 2011]. The patient was from the military observational study. No information on patient's medical or family history or concurrent or concomitant condition were provided. On unspecified date, the patient had received unspecified live attenuated influenza (LAIV); unspecified meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and unspecified tetanus, diphtheria & acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) vaccines and unspecified adenovirus vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided for all). The age of vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date between 1st October 2011 through 31st July 2018, 1 day following concurrent receipt of the vaccines, the patient onset of symptoms occurred and has been diagnosed with the anaphylaxis. [In this study, the main diagnosis for each report was categorized into a MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) grouping. Reports suggestive of anaphylaxis or GBS were further classified using the Brighton Collaboration criteria or a physician's diagnosis]. This case has been considered as serious as per the author. [In this study, Reports are classified as serious based on the Code of Regulations if one of the following is reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability, or congenital anomaly]. Treatment was unknown. [In this study, each of the patients was treated with epinephrine, antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy]. The outcome of event was not reported.  The author commented, ""We identified eight reports of anaphylaxis following adenovirus vaccine classified as serious and on review of medical records all were identified as participants in the military observational study. In two patients the anaphylaxis was considered as possibly related to vaccines. In addition, 95 percent of the adenovirus vaccine reports documented co-administration of other vaccines and 50 percent reported co-administration of penicillin G (or other antibiotic if allergic to penicillin) according to standard protocol in this military population. The investigators of the earlier military observational study also commented that concurrent vaccine exposures in the recruit population was an important limiting factor for attributing the statistical signaling outcomes including psoriasis, anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions as possibly related to the vaccine"". The author concluded ""The reporting rate for serious AEs was higher than with other vaccines administered in the comparison military recruit population (39 percent vs 18 percent however, we identified no unexpected or concerning pattern of adenovirus vaccine AEs. Co-administration of vaccines and IM Pen G was commonly reported in this military population. These exposures may have contributed to the GBS and anaphylaxis outcomes observed with the adenovirus vaccine. Future adenovirus vaccine safety studies in a population without these co-administrations would be helpful in clarifying the vaccine's safety profile"". This is 1 of the 19 valid cases reported in this literature article.",,,,,,,,,U,,,,,UNK,,,,,,USGLAXOSMITHKLINEUS2019GS,2,10/03/2019,,,,

The mother's current medical conditions included bacterial vaginosis, nausea, vomiting, Herpes simplex, hypertension, trichomoniasis, anemia, elevated alpha-fetoprotein and uterine dehiscence. The mother's historical medications included Metrogel (metronidazole). The mother's concomitant medications included: Metrogel (metronidazole) for bacterial vaginosis, Flagyl (metronidazole) for trichomoniasis, Procardia (nifedipine) for hypertension, Venofer (saccharated iron oxide) for anaemia and Prenatal vitamins (minerals NOS, vitamins NOS) for pregnancy.   The subject's mother had six previous pregnancies. Five pregnancies ended with full term live birth and one ended with pre-term live birth.

Concomitant medications included prenatal vitamins (minerals NOS, vitamins NOS) for pregnancy and Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride) for anxiety.  The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 10-Nov-2018, the estimated date of delivery (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery was 17-Aug-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 12-Mar-2019, the subject underwent spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis mutation analysis and hemoglobin electrophoresis and no MCM was noted.  On 19-Mar-2019, the subject underwent ultrasound and quad screen, and no MCM was noted.  On 15-May-2019, at approximately 26 weeks of gestation, the subject was administered Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, batch number: 252664, dose: 0.5 mL, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation.   On an unreported date, at 34 weeks of gestation, the subject experienced eclampsia, reported as pregnancy complication.  On 13-Aug-2019, at gestational age of 39.4 weeks, the subject delivered a live birth, male neonate via caesarean section. The neonate's birth weight was 3250 grams, head circumference was 35.6 cm and length was 50.8 cm. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes). There was no APGAR score data for 10 minutes reported. No MCM was identified at birth.   At the time of initial reporting, the outcome for the event of 'eclampsia' was not reported.  Company Comment: The subject experienced eclampsia after vaccination with the suspect product Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD. Chronology is plausible. Reportedly, vaccination occurred during pregnancy. Chronology is plausible. Medical history of hypertension and pregnant state may have contributed to development of the event. Causality was confounded by use of concomitant medication, Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride). Causal relationship between the suspect product and exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related. For the event eclampsia, causal role of the suspect product cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as related.; Reporter's Comments: The subject experienced eclampsia after vaccination with the suspect product Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD.
