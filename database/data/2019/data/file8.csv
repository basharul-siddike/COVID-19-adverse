No Follow-up Needed as long as improving. 10/30/19 This is a 4 year old male that presents with concerns for reaction to vaccination. He was given his varicella, Kinrix and MMR vaccines 2 days ago. Mother noticed the night of his vaccines that he was developing some erythema and warmth around his left thigh where the vaccines had been administered. He had no other trouble breathing. He had no diarrhea or emesis. She gave some Motrin and let him relax overnight. In the morning he had a couple other areas of rash on his chest and back. He states that the area was itchy and kind of sore, so mother called out triage line and at the time he did not have any other symptoms. No fever, no work of breathing or anything like that, so they were recommended to give some more Motrin and to followup today. Today the area is slightly larger than she saw last night. She had outlined it the night before and it is still warm but the patient is not complaining of any soreness at this time. He does state that it is itchy. He is having no other symptoms today and the areas of rash that were on his abdomen and back appear to be improving. O: Temperature is 97.9. General: Patient is awake and alert sitting up on the clinic table in no acute distress. Eyes: PERR bilaterally without conjunctival injection. ENT: Bilateral tympanic membranes are clear of erythema or bulge. Tympanostomy tubes are in place. Nares are patent without rhinorrhea. Throat is clear of erythema or exudate. CV: Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops. Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheeze or crackle. Abdomen: If obese and soft and nontender with good bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. Skin: On the left thigh surrounding the area of his previous vaccination there is an area of erythema and warmth. It is a large patch about 5 cm x 6 cm. It has an irregular border. It is slightly outside the line that mother marked last night. There is no tenderness to palpation of the area. It is nonfluctuant. There are no other rashes or lesions noted on his body. A/P: This appears to be a local reaction most likely to the varicella vaccine that was placed in that leg. As he did not have a previous reaction before and has no intention to have that vaccine again as he has gotten his 2, this is unlikely to happen again. I recommended that they do some Benadryl 12.5 mg every 6 hours as needed to see if that helps and this should help this go away.

Patch testing was available after waiting 2 weeks after the last dose of Prednisone so the steroids will not interact with the results of the patch testing.  Patch testing was placed on 10/28/19, first patch test read and removed on 10/30/19, and final read on 11/1/19. Results from the patch testing showed allergic response to Thimerosal. In addition, took off work on 10/29/19 due to lack of sleep from the rash and symptoms of the rash (hives, itching, redness, swelling, inflammation, and severe pain of the chest, neck, and face).  I have been taking Benadryl and Claritin to try to ease the symptoms with little luck. I went to another allergist on 10/29/19, and he prescribed montelukast, zyrtec, and hydralazine to help with the inflammation, allergic reaction, and sleep (but with little luck, the symptoms of the effects of the flu shot still persists).   Rash has continued to this day and has spread to other areas of the body- entire face/ears, traps, upper back, and arms (starting around 10/14/19). The rash and effects of the flu shot is still currently affecting everyday life including effecting work (concentration/ coming in to work/ wearing OR scrubs and normal clothing) and ability to sleep at night. The lack of sleep interferes with work as well. As mentioned, the rash is currently still very itchy, red, swollen, dry, with inflammation, and severe pain of the chest, neck, and face.",,,,,,,,,N,09/20/2019,09/22/2019,2,"CBC- LYMPHOCYTES INCREASED, EOSINOPHILS INCREASED PATCH TESTING- THIMEROSAL",WRK,,PRENATAL VITAMINS TUMERIC B100,,ECZEMA,,,2,11/01/2019,,Y,,

Initially I felt ok, but after about 4 hours I started feeling itchy and tingly to my whole body. My heart rate felt very fast and my chest felt a little tight so I took 2 puffs of my albuterol inhaler which I had previously been prescribed for exercise induced asthma. The rest of the night I still felt itchy and tingly but was able to go to sleep. The next morning I went to work still feeling a little itchy and tingly. Around 10:30am I started feeling an intense itching and burning to my left shoulder and when I looked down I noticed some hives to that shoulder. At this point I went to Employee Health to be evaluated. The nurse saw me and noticed the hives and asked if I had any shortness of breath. At that point I did not but I did tell her it felt as though my heart rate was fast. She told me the NP would not be in for a little while and that I could wait or go back to work and come back if my symptoms got worse. I decided to go back to work and to have her call me when the FNP was back in. I was called that the FNP would be back at 1:00pm so I went there around 1:30pm. At this time the hives had gone away, my heart rate felt to have decreased a little from before, the itching and tingling had decreased. At this point my heart rate was checked and it was about 109bpm calm and  sitting down which is still elevated from my normal of about 50-60bpm. The FNP was concerned that my heart rate was elevated from my normal and that I had had hives to that shoulder earlier so she gave me Zyrtec and Benadryl to have on hold in case the symptoms came back or got worse. The rest of the day I had some itching and tingling but by the morning of 11/2/19  my heart rate has normalized and the itching and tingling has just about completely subsided.

At almost the same time I received a massive cold sore on my left upper lip inside and outside of the lip.   It was very painful and large.   I treated myself with alcohol swabs which I have always found worked good on any shingle.   I still have a small bit of the cold sore on my lip it is almost gone. I have been feeling very unwell and overall lethargic.  I am undergoing treatment for a possible urine infection and am also on Cephalexin twice daily but the clinic has not confirmed the infection as yet.  But last evening on the first of November I started to get up and my left front thigh was so painful it felt like someone hit me with a bat repeatedly on that front part of my thigh.  I took Ibuprophen two 200mg tabs.  It helped somewhat.  I was able to sleep.  Today I took one potassium over the counter pill thinking it might help and maybe I was dehydrated or something from the possible urine infection.  I did ok all day until this evening and I began feeling lethargic again and I have had GERD now for about three days or so.  I am very tired, my eyes are also bothering me, dry and they seem like they are somewhat infected and get blurry off and on during the day.

Test results for the infection were negative, however I felt increasingly anxious; enough to check myself back in after release given all clear on kidney infection.

He prescribed a 14 day regimen of Cephalexin which I am still taking and we agreed that I would continue steroid cream twice a day and take Benadryl at night given that I do not tolerate well most other antihistamines.

About 24 hours after receiving it, I came down with a series of somewhat non-specific but all very unusual symptoms, starting with each arm independently becoming very cold and almost numb, followed by general malaise and feeling ""off"", heart palpitations/heart racing, excessive thirst and urination (requiring drinking 24oz water bottles every 2 hours or so, much much higher than baseline - no matter how much I drank, I remained extremely thirsty and with dry mouth), excessive sweating on palms and soles of feet, chills and difficulty maintaining a comfortable temperature, inability to sleep, pallor, minor/occasional dry cough, stomach discomfort/mild nausea, loose stools x 2, all lasting from 4PM that afternoon the day after the vaccine until about 9-10AM the next day.  Symptoms seemed to fluctuate a little bit but were at a persistent level of malaise throughout. I had never previously experienced anything like this before and felt about the worst I have ever felt physically in my life.  I am a physician and had my vitals checked when I arrived to work around 7:30AM near the end of it, with elevated blood pressure to the 146/86 range (baseline systolic is 110-120s), afebrile.  I had a difficult time making it through work, but was able to do so starting to feel a little better.  By the time I proceeded to my physician's office that afternoon, I was feeling much better. In the proceeding 1-2 days, I have had a few much more minor episodes since of 30-60 min of feeling off sporadically.  The family physician and I both agreed these symptoms were most likely a delayed reaction to the influenza vaccine given time course and diffuse nature of symptoms.  I was tested for other possibilities such as a thyroid condition, with bloodwork unremarkable.

The patient had a really bad near death reaction 1 and 1/2 hours after the vaccination and was unconscious and in a coma for 5 days and was delirious for another two days after. Less than a week affter getting the vaccine, the patient woke up with shooting pain up the spine that went to his shoulders. Second time he came to consciousness he was awake and experienced fevers and chills.  Then he slept again and woke up with severe pain all over the body and he passed out because of the pain.  He stated that he had difficulty eating for 2 weeks after getting the Shingrix vaccine. Initially less than a month after receiving the shot, he had itching on various parts of his body that was below the surface of the skin. It was went away after a month or two which was consistent with a reaction to the shot and might be shingles. The patient had been really sick and partially from some outside things but mainly due to the reaction from the shot. The patient also reported that, every toe was tingling on each feet and the tingling was matching on both feet for months and then it stopped and his toes, feet and ankles were numb. The numbness was 5 to 6 inches above his ankles and was exactly in the same area on both feet. The patient described it as, when toes went numb he knew it was neurological which occurred 7 days after the vaccination. He had symptoms a half hour after the vaccine but his physician did not believe there was a correlation and denied that it could have happened. That physician had since retired, the patient saw another doctor who said it was impossible even though he was unconscious after getting the shot.  The patient's doctor had told him that, he had peripheral neuropathy in the fall of 2018. His left hand shakes all the time that began in the fall of 2018 and he could not rely on it.  There was nerve damage present on his left and right hand and both hands were shaking, but the left hand was much worse. The patient was lucid and sleeping a lot after 7 days from the reaction with matching tingling toes.  Less than 4 months after the vaccine, the patient could not drive and was in bad shape until early April 2018. The patient also reported bad back pain that was really serious. It was so bad that he could not plant his garlic in the greenhouse without laying on his side because he could not bend his back. This started in late April or early May 2018 but it eased up after physical therapy and he got dry needling which miraculously cured his back pain. He also had stiff hands in the fall of 2018.   In April 2018 less than 3 months after getting the Shingrix, the patient started to experience dry throat and dry eyes. He related these symptoms to an immune response called Sjogren's syndrome. The back pain was located in his lower back and he had another back reaction in late fall and in April, May and June of 2019 also he had another flare up. In May 2019 less than 4 months after the vaccination, in the course of 1 to 2 weeks he had symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis including joints in both feet and made it difficult for him to walk in his kitchen with numbing in his skin and the connective tissue of his feet. The numbness was below the skin in the connective tissue and when he pressed hard he felt the ligaments and bones in the deep parts of the foot. It started to hurt with the arthritis symptoms which had continued till the date of reporting. The patient had a period in 2019 where everything started to get worse including his back pain. The patient was experiencing a massive immune response which he believed was related to the shot. He had an ongoing immune issues like immune cells attacking his healthy tissue and his feet are numb with various health problems. If he had immune response symptoms flare ups, which he had on and off, his back would start hurting again. The symptoms had bilateral symmetry in both feet which still continued.   He also experienced joint pain that was episodic which began months after his autoimmune reaction and had been getting worse since April 2019. He has had difficulty walking and stumbled and fall when turning to do something. He falls at least once a month and has been getting worse since April of 2019. Less than a year of vaccination and a few months later after having an autoimmune reaction to the Shingrix, the patient's testicles hurt bad that he had to go to emergency room and they flared up again. The patient again went to emergency room in early September of 2019 and July of 2019.   This condition he described as Epididymitis as per his urologist.

I was having difficulties with basic functions such as walking, climbing stairs, holding a glass in one hand, picking up heavy items, etc.  I initially saw my internist, who ran a complete blood panel for 11 items.  All ranges were normal. Dr. referred me to a neurologist, who did a complete evaluation in January, 2019.  He was unable to identify the cause of the condition and discussed the possible need for nerve conduction tests if the condition did not resolve itself.  I had additional blood work done in March, 2019  by Dr. with no change in the results.  In May, 2019, Dr. performed a nerve conduction test and found no systemic issues.

Started crawling at 5 months, walking at the age of 10 months, had good appetite, overall was in good health with no concerns. She was saying simple 1 syllable words ?mama , dada?). Per pediatrician notes on the 12 months visit MD said ?well baby, no concerns, on track with her development?.  After receiving MMR vaccine on 3/24/2016 she became lethargic later that night and had a low grade fever of 101 (which was explained to us was ?normal?). She was still very tired and irritable the following day and had very poor appetite. These symptoms continued until the following week. And even though her fever resolved, her energy level was not the same.   My husband and I noticed that patient was not the same child anymore.  Her appetite became very poor, she didn?t make any progress in her vocabulary (at 15 months she was still saying 1 syllable words).  At out 18 months visit, pediatrician was concerned with poor appetite and sleep, along with bad temper tantrums. She also didn?t make much progress with her speech, her vocabulary only consisted of 4-10 words per her chart records. Per MD note ?patients has some behavioral issues?.   At 2 year follow up, she really was behind on her speech, still only used simple words and no sentences, and only gained 1 pound since 18 months follow up visit. She also developed GI symptoms, constipation, hard stools and her appetite didn?t improve since previous visit. Per pediatrician notes ?developmental and behavioral issues? were noted at that time. We had another follow up visit with Dr. on August 3rd, 2017 regarding patient?s very poor appetite and developmental delay issues. Per MD after visit summary ?growth and eating concerns, as well as speech concerns were noted?. At 2 years 6 months patient?s speech really didn?t progress, she only used simple words and rarely combined them into sentences, her articulation was quiet poor as well. So Dr. referred us to speech therapist for an evaluation. Per initial speech therapist evaluation, on 09/26/2017, patient had expressive language disorder and articulation disorder. Her expressive language skills were consistent with that of an 18 months old and receptive language skills of an 21 months old. Her vocabulary was reduced and she did not consistently combined words into phrases. She also demonstrated decreased oral motor range of motion when producing words. Per speech therapist summary, difficulties in these areas have negatively impacted patient?s ability to functionally communicate her needs and wants in her daily life. And speech therapy was initiated at twice a week sessions.  At the age of 3, patient was only able to use 3-4 words sentences with very poor articulation. We are still seeing therapist for speech therapy weekly. Patient is still behind in her development, she is 4.5 now, and even though her vocabulary and speech improved since our initial evaluation, she is still behind in articulation with speech equivalent of a 3 year old. Her appetite is still very poor and she still has a lot of behavioral concerns, as well  GI issues (constipation, recurring enemas and Miralax use daily). At this point, we saw GI specialist Dr. as well as nutritionist with very little improvement.",,,,,,,,Y,N,03/24/2016,03/24/2016,0,Diagnostics solutions/ GI map Stool sample- 10/04/2019 CBC- 10/22/2019 Methalation/Neuropsych profile test-10/11/2019  Vibrant Wellness- wheat zoomer/intestinal permeability -10/22/2019,PVT,,None,None,None,,,2,11/06/2019,,Y,,None

Abstract:  Case Presentation: A 62 year old woman with a history of hypertension suddenly developed a headache starting 3 days after receiving the influenza vaccine. The headache worsened and was associated with nausea, photosensitivity and vomiting. The next day she was lethargic, and that night, her husband states she sat up in bed and started ""speaking in tongues"" as if she was ""possessed"". He brought her to the emergency room where she was extremely disoriented, could not follow commands or respond appropriately. Temperature was 101.2F on presentation, and remained afebrile afterward. She had diffuse hyperreflexia with ankle clonus bilaterally; otherwise exam was unremarkable. Serum white blood count was 12.2, ESR 51, CRP 3.40; anticardiolipin IgM and beta-2-glycoprotein were elevated. The remainder of serological studies were unremarkable, including anti-NMDA antibodies, tick borne infections, autoimmune and viral studies. CT head and CTA of the head and neck were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture showed protein of 57, 87 white blood cells and 36 red blood cells; glucose was normal. Other cerebrospinal fluid tests including herpes virus and oligoclonal bands were negative. MRI brain demonstrated multifocal ovoid and serpiginous areas of diffusion restriction and T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, frontoparietal white matter, thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus; this was thought most consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). She was briefly treated with IV acyclovir (until HSV PCR was found to be negative), and IV steroids for 5 days followed by prednisone taper over about 1 month. Her mental status improved dramatically each day; score on montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) test was 19/30 on discharge. At follow up 1 month after presentation, she complained of some problems with short-term memory and balance, but was otherwise back to normal. Examination demonstrated MOCA of 26/30, difficulty with tandem gait, and mild hyperreflexia without clonus; neurologic exam was otherwise normal. Cardiolipin IgM was borderline-positive, ESR 13, CRP 2.2, and beta-2-glycoprotein was negative. Repeat MRI demonstrated resolution of diffusion restriction and improvement in the size and number of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities without any new lesions. Discussion: ADEM is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The assumed mechanism is immunemediated demyelination triggered by infection, or, rarely, vaccination. For most vaccines, incidence rates of ADEM are as low as 0.1 to 0.2 per 100,000 vaccinated individuals. A search from 1979 to 2013 showed only 3 cases of seasonal influenza vaccine associated with ADEM. As such, there have been no large population studies with estimated incidence rates yet. Lesion patterns often seen in ADEM include widespread, multifocal lesions in the white and deep grey matter, as seen in our patient. Conclusions: Significant spontaneous recovery is the expected outcome in most cases of vaccine-induced ADEM, usually occurring within 1-6 months. Based on the current literature, it is difficult to predict who may be at risk. The risk must be balanced by the fact that influenza infection itself is a risk factor for ADEM, which is likely more common than that triggered by the vaccine. We do not advocate avoiding any vaccinations, but wish to promote awareness of this potential complication, as early identification and treatment may improve outcomes, and avoid unnecessary testing and treatment  This case involves a 62 years old female patient who experienced acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (adem) (Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), short-term memory (Amnesia) and balance (Balance disorder), while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.

On an unknown date, The patient developed a serious acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (adem) (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) (3 days latemcy), short-term memory and balance (amnesia) (latency: 1 month), some problems with balance (balance disorder) (latency: 1 month), headache worsened (headache) (3 days latemcy), nausea (nausea), photosensitivity (photosensitivity reaction), vomiting (vomiting), lethargic (lethargy), speaking in tongues as if she was possessed (verbigeration), extremely disoriented (disorientation), ould not follow commands or respond appropriately (abnormal behaviour), diffuse hyperreflexia (hyperreflexia), ankle clonus bilaterally (clonus) Unknown latency following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. Other than amnesia and balance disorder, all other events was assessed as medically significant. The patient was hospitalized for these events.

On Friday, October 4th I began to feel fatigued and experienced some discomfort in my throat. On Saturday the throat discomfort, not exactly a sore throat but generally feeling like something was going on. This continued on Sunday the 6th and worsened on Monday the 7th. I continued feeling fatigued and having some discomfort in my throat through the remainder of the week including a fever and went home early on Tuesday, was off sick on Wednesday and then worked through Thursday and Friday. By Monday the 14th whatever was causing the issues in my throat moved to my chest turning into an upper respiratory infection and fever. I was off work two days that week and on vacation Thursday and Friday but remained very ill with fever, chills, coughing, but with no congestion I have had some issues catching my breath during coughing fits to the point where my husband was ready to call 911 in the middle of the night. About a week ago I noticed tenderness in the upper quadrant of my right arm. I thought that maybe I had strained a muscle. It got to the point where it hurt to press down to write something. A couple of days ago my husband noticed a bruise in the area where the tenderness is and it was then I realized that it was right below the area where the flu shot was given. It appears that what I am dealing with is indeed muscle pain and deep tissue bruising. Today I still have a terrible cough and have all but lost my voice. While I am susceptible to upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia none of the symptoms I've experienced in the last month are similar to those that I have experienced with any of the conditions I've had with those illness. In addition the fatigue is unbearable at times. I just haven't felt well since before getting the flu shot. I hope I provided what you might need so that the lot can be reported.

Friday morning, the patient woke up at 7:30AM and had lost about 50% of his hearing in his RIGHT ear (vaccine in left arm). He said he felt like he was talking into a barrel, and he couldn't really hear high-pitched noises - low-pitched noises were more audible, but still muffled. He said he did not feel congested or stuffy at all, and it was only his right ear that was bothering him. He regularly cleans his ears, but did not clean them Thursday or Friday. He does not think he has wax build-up in the ear. Patient also stated that a close friend of his also reported hearing loss after receiving the shot, and that patient was currently seeking medical care for the hearing loss (that event did not occur here, but patient states the incident was reported by his physician). After discussion with the patient, we agreed that it could be the body's response to the vaccine and he might have some congestion/stuffiness/fluid that may be affecting the ear.

Symptoms persisted for several years despite multiple courses of oral and intranasal steroids, antihistamines, and leukotriene modifiers. She had no history of pneumonia or recurrent infections.

The patient had received the pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) at another pharmacy. When the patient had the reaction she did not break out into hives but had itching down to her elbow, toward the collar bone and into her chest and she had a really big knot that felt like an egg but was quite a bit bigger and it was bruised but slightly sore but not overly painful. This was the patient's first year getting pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein) and she was concerned about getting the pneumovax next year because of the reaction to the pneumococcal 13-val conj vac (dipht crm197 protein). The itching, swelling and knot size had gone down and some of the bruising was gone and it was still a little sore but not as sore. The outcome of itching was recovered, the other event was recovering.

It does appear symptoms started after receiving this injection although the exact timeline is not completely clear.  She does report some tingling around her lips and does have a slightly question of a prominent lip lower.  Differential includes an allergic reaction given these findings versus a cellulitis that subsequently developed after her injection versus a DVT of the upper extremity though likely is more of an allergic type reaction. � She was bolused with Solu-Medrol, Benadryl as well as ranitidine in the emergency department.  I did elect to cover her with antibiotic therapy for the potential for a cellulitis as she does have an elevation in her CRP today. Pt has no history of MRSA.  White blood cell count was normal however.  No fever documented today. � I did obtain an ultrasound of the patient's left upper extremity to rule out acute DVT formation although the patient is likely at low risk for this.  Us today is negative.  No notation of abscess formation or deeper infection. � Patient will be continued on Benadryl over-the-counter, prednisone and ranitidine.  I did elect to also place the patient on ongoing antibiotic therapy given the unclear nature of her symptoms today.  I do expect this patient's symptoms should improve over the next 24 hours.  Should patient develop a fever or additional symptoms including oral swelling, patient will seek prompt follow-up.  I did ask patient to seek follow-up nonetheless with her primary in approximate 24 to 48 hours.  She voices her understanding of this plan of care and ultimately is discharged home in the care of her husband.  �  From doctors visit on 11/12/19: HENT: No sore throat, rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, earaches.

Received for consultation on WS19-6665 are 3 slides and 1 block. Additional slides prepared from the block were also reviewed. Immunostains were prepared in the lab here with adequate tissue controls. Sections show acanthosis, spongiosis with small intraepidermal vesicle formation, papillary dermal edema and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils. There is focal vacuolar interface change. No viral inclusions are identified. Review of the PAS stained section fails to reveal any fungal elements.The lymphoid cells show immunoreactivity for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD4, CD7, and CD8 (less than CD4) with no significant decrease in pan-T antigens.  CD20 marks a few cells.  CD30 marks rare cells. The findings are not regarded as etiologically specific. Given the clinical history this could represent post- vaccination reactive changes / hypersensitivity reaction or possibly a drug eruption. The differential includes a chronic eczematous process. Considerations include contact dermatitis, nummular dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis.  Further clinical correlation is advised. This case was reviewed in consultation with Hematopathology and with Infectious Disease Pathology. This case was reviewed in consultation with a staff dermatologist-dermatopathologist at Medical Center.  M.D. Dermatopathology Microscopic Description Histologic sections of skin demonstrate slight acanthosis with spongiosis. The overlying cornified layer maintains a basket-weave configuration. Lymphohistiocytic inflammation is found predominantly surrounding superficial dermal vessels. Scattered eosinophils are also present.  A PAS stained slide does not reveal any definitive evidence of fungal elements. A rare subcorneal pustule is identified on the PAS stained slide.

Rash consists of multiple rounded (irregular) lesions on entire body from the neck down.  Concern for generalized  vaccinia was ruled out via negative PCR swabs and blood/serum testing by Lab.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the multiple sclerosis, influenza-like symptoms, chills, pain, headache, sensitive skin, skin pain, rash, walking difficulty, numbness in feet, urination difficulty, defecation difficult and anal numbness to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: The case was reported by patient's wife. The patient received Shingrix on left arm. The patient experienced flu like symptoms, described as achy all over and chills and headache.  The patient's skin became sensitive to touch, primarily on the left side above the waist but below the underarm. The skin was painful to the touch. The patient also experienced difficulty walking. The patient then began to feel numbness in his groin and rectal area. and had difficulty urinating and defecating due to not being able to have feeling. On 29th October 2019,the patient went to the emergency department. The patient did not remain overnight and was advised to see a neurologist the next morning.  On 31st October 2019, the patient was dianosed with multiple sclerosis. The neurologist said that the patient might have multiple sclerosis. The neurologist performed an MRI of the spine and brain, which were unremarkable.   The patient was also tested for Lyme disease but results are not known at the time of reporting.

Abstract: Influenza virus vaccineeinduced cryoglobulinemia has been reported in only 1 patient,1 whereas pneumococcal-induced cryoglobulinemia has never been described. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a systemic inflammatory syndrome that is caused by the development of immunoglobulins that deposit at low temperatures affecting small and medium blood vessels and may manifest as either an inflammatory or noninflammatory vasculopathy.2 Multiple organs including the skin are most commonly affected.2 Mixed cryoglobulinemia has been regularly associated with Hepatitis C viral infection2 and may persist even when the infection has been eradicated. Vasculitides have been associated with vaccination. We report on a patient without prior immunologic disease whose disease occurred shortly after vaccination with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, and persisted.  This case involves a 76 years old male patient who experienced type ii mixed cryoglobulinemia (cryoglobulinaemia) while he received vaccines PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE (PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE) and INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT).  The patient's past medical history included Vascular graft and Gastrooesophageal reflux disease. The patient's past medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided. At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing Coronary artery disease and Hypercholesterolaemia.   On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE not produced by Sanofi Pasteur lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, The patient developed a serious type ii mixed cryoglobulinemia (cryoglobulinaemia), flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness) and cyanosis of the toes and fingers (cyanosis) 5 days following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. These events were assessed as medically significant.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious leukocytoclastic vasculitis (hypersensitivity vasculitis), purpuric lesions on his toes and fingers/worsening purpura (purpura), acral pain (pain), digital ischemia/increasing acral ischemic symptoms (ischaemia), livedo reticularis of both plantar surfaces (livedo reticularis) Unknown latency following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. These events were assessed as medically significant.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious anorexia (decreased appetite), night sweats (night sweats), myalgias (myalgia), fatigue (fatigue), arthralgias (arthralgia)  4 weeks following the administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. These events were assessed as medically significant.  Relevant laboratory test results included: Blood immunoglobulin G - On an unknown date: 19 [19] Blood immunoglobulin M - On an unknown date: 64 [64]; on an unknown date: elevated [elevated] C-reactive protein - On an unknown date: 5.24 mg/dL [5.24] Complement factor C3 - On an unknown date: 75.50 mg/dL [75.50] Complement factor C4 - On an unknown date: <1.67 mg/dL [<1.67]; on an unknown date: low level mg/dL [low level] Red blood cell sedimentation rate - On an unknown date: 48 mm/h [48] Rheumatoid factor - On an unknown date: 24 iU/mL [24]; on an unknown date: 54 iU/mL [54] Total complement activity test (60 - 185) - On an unknown date: 28 [28]. A bone marrow biopsy finding was normal.  Final diagnosis was flu-like symptoms, leukocytoclastic vasculitis and type ii mixed cryoglobulinemia.   Corrective treamtnet: was initially treated with oral prednisone, 20 mg daily, which was increased 2 weeks later to 40 mg daily. Intravenous rituximab, 375 mg/mm2, was administered weekly for a total of 4 infusions (additional 2 infusions of rituximab were given monthly.). His acral lesions healed roughly 3 months after his last rituximab infusion. Prednisone, 40 mg daily, was continued throughout the first 3 months of his course and then slowly tapered and stopped 4 months after his last infusion of rituximab. Twenty months after his initial presentation, he began therapy with oral cyclophosphamide, 100 mg daily, and oral prednisone, 10 mg daily. 3 years after his presentation, his doses have been decreased to cyclophosphamide, 50 mg every other day, and prednisone, 5 mg daily.  The patient recovered from nonpalpable, purpuric lesions on his toes and fingers/worsening purpura and outcome is reported as Recovering / Resolving from all other events.  Reporter's causality: based on the timing of the vaccination, constellation of symptoms, and positive laboratory results, influenza virus induced cryoglobulinemia is the most probable cause of our patient's symptoms.  There will be no information available on the batch number for this case.; Sender's Comments: A 76 years old male patient experienced cryoglobulinaemia along with associated  and non-associated events after vaccination with INFLUENZA VACCINE (TRIVALENT) and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. Time to onset is compatible with the role of the vaccines. Past medical history included Vascular graft and Gastrooesophageal reflux disease. At the time of the event, the patient had ongoing Coronary artery disease and Hypercholesterolaemia. However, further information including concomitant medications, previous vaccination and tolerance would be needed to fully assess this case.

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia, leukocytoclastic vasculitis and flu-like symptoms in a 76-year- old male patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified trivalent influenza vaccine and unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (manufacturer unknown for both) for prophylaxis. The patient's medical history included coronary artery disease, bypass surgery, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient had no prior immunologic disease. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.

The age of vaccination was not provided but it could be 75 or 76 years. On an unspecified date, at the age of 76 years, 5 days after the vaccinations, the patient presented with flu-like symptoms and cyanosis of the toes and fingers. The patient had nonpalpable, purpuric lesions on his toes and fingers (necrosis of the distal finger) along with acral pain. The patient progressively had worsening purpura and digital ischemia along with livedo reticularis of both plantar surfaces. Within 4 weeks, the patient had anorexia, night sweats, myalgias, fatigue, and arthralgias. A biopsy was offered and discussed with the patient, but the patient refused initially.  Laboratory evaluation found a normal complete blood count, normal urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panel, negative antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, immunofixation electrophoresis, hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody. The following test results were abnormal: rheumatoid factor: 24 (normal range: less than 20 IU/mL); total hemolytic complement level [CH50]: 28 (normal range: 60-185); complement component 3 (C3) level: 75.50 (normal range: more than 78 mg/dL); C4 level: less than 1.67 (normal range: more than 16 mg/dL); Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 48 (normal range: less than 20 mm/h), high sensitive C-reactive protein: 5.24 (normal range: less than 4.0 mg/dL); antiphosphatidylserine Immunoglobulin G (IgG): 19 (normal range, less than 11) and antiphosphatidylserine(IgM: 64 (normal range: less than 25). A chest radiograph and Doppler studies of blood flow of the extremities were also normal. Initial testing for cryoglobulins was negative. Two weeks later, the patient's rheumatoid factor was 54 IU/mL. The patient was initially treated with oral prednisone, 20 mg daily, which was increased 2 weeks later to 40 mg daily. However, the patient continued to develop new acral purpuric lesions and had increasing acral pain. Therefore, 6 weeks into this course, intravenous rituximab, 375 mg/mm2, was administered weekly for a total of 4 infusions. Because of limited clinical change, an additional 2 infusions of rituximab were given monthly. Cryoglobulins were detected for the first time at the end of his fourth infusion of rituximab. The patient's acral lesions healed (healing of toes and fingers) roughly 3 months after the patient's last rituximab infusion. Prednisone, 40 mg daily, was continued throughout the first 3 months of his course and then slowly tapered and stopped 4 months after his last infusion of rituximab. The patient's cryoglobulin level continued to be detectable, and 18 months after his initial presentation, he had increasing acral ischemic symptoms, and an elevated IgM level and low C4 level led to plans for another 4 rituximab infusions. However, before the second set of infusions, palpable purpura developed on his legs. Biopsy at that time found leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and direct immunofluorescence microscopy found IgG in the vessel walls. At that time, the patient was treated by service with oral prednisone, 40 mg daily, which was tapered and stopped over 3 weeks and the patient's hematologist administered another 4 weekly infusions of intravenous rituximab. The patient was seen at clinic (hematology), and a type II cryoglobulin was identified and characterized as IgM kappa (k) monoclonal cryoglobulinemia with polyclonal IgG cryoglobulinemia. A bone marrow biopsy finding was normal. Twenty months after the patient's initial presentation, he began therapy with oral cyclophosphamide, 100 mg daily, and oral prednisone, 10 mg daily. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings had been controlled with this regimen, and 3 years after his presentation, his doses had been decreased to cyclophosphamide, 50 mg every other day, and prednisone, 5 mg daily. Although the patient's symptoms and physical findings had remained controlled, his low level of C4 had persisted. The authors commented, ""The mechanisms of vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia induced by the influenza or pneumococcal vaccination remain unknown. It was not possible to ascertain which vaccine responsible for this patient's disease, but it we propose that it was more likely caused by the viral vaccination. Mixed cryoglobulinemia was commonly associated with viral infections including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, or Epstein-Barr virus. The mechanism of viral-induced cryoglobulinemia is not completely understood but was postulated to be caused by cryoglobulin formation induced by cytokine or chemokine-mediated immune response to the HCV infection. It was not clear why cryoglobulins were produced as a response to a viral antigen was triggered in response to a vaccination. Studies have shown that mixed cryoglobulinemia can persist or recur after successful treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) without detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) in the serum yet detectable in the cryoprecipitate. Although a causal link with the influenza vaccination cannot be proved by our observation, we can speculate that based on the timing of the vaccination, constellation of symptoms, and positive laboratory results, influenza viruses induced cryoglobulinemia was the most probable cause of our patient's symptoms. Induction of cryoglobulin after viral stimulation may result in a prolonged disease. Early recognition and treatment can improve patients' long-term outcome. Further research was necessary to explore the possible immunopathogenic link due to the sequential nature of the disease following vaccinations.""

Literature citation-  The following is the abstract from the article-  Acute seronegative autoimmune hepatitis is a rare entity but has been reported in the literature. Few cases have been reported where hepatitis occured after yellow fever vaccine. We present a case of acute seronegative autoimmune hepatitis (SAIH) that has probable association with yellow fever vaccine as indicated by the patient's strong history.  This case involves a 35 years old female patient who experienced seronegative autoimmune hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis), while she received vaccine YELLOW FEVER VACCINE.  The patient's past vaccination(s) included yellow fever vaccine. The patient's past medical history, medical treatment(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect YELLOW FEVER VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain (abdominal pain upper), seronegative autoimmune hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis), (Unknown latency) following the administration of YELLOW FEVER VACCINE. This event was assessed as medically significant. The patient was hospitalized for this event.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious jaundice and intermittent low grade fever (pyrexia) (Unknown latency) following the administration of YELLOW FEVER VACCINE. The patient was hospitalized for this event.  On an unknown date, the patient was discharge from the hospital.  Relevant laboratory test results included: Alanine aminotransferase - On an unknown date: 2189 [2189]; on an unknown date: 1146 [1146]; on an unknown date: 603 [603]; on an unknown date: 78 [78] Aspartate aminotransferase - On an unknown date: 2135 [2135]; on an unknown date: 1087 [1087]; on an unknown date: 374 [374]; on an unknown date: 67 [67] Bilirubin conjugated abnormal - On an unknown date: 1.8 [1.8]; on an unknown date: 12.5 [12.5]; on an unknown date: 10.2 Blood albumin - On an unknown date: 3.6 [3.6]; on an unknown date: 2.7 [2.7] Blood alkaline phosphatase - On an unknown date: 213 [213]; on an unknown date: 132 [132]; on an unknown date: 83 [83] Blood bilirubin - On an unknown date: 2.5 [2.5]; on an unknown date: 20.7 [20.7]; on an unknown date: 19.1; on an unknown date: 3.6 [3.6] International normalised ratio - On an unknown date: 1.3 [1.3] Platelet count - On an unknown date: 13.2 [13.2] Protein total - On an unknown date: 7.9 [7.9]; on an unknown date: 7 [7]  (Other relevant tests included CT abdomen was unremarkable for biliary system abnormalities Her viral panel (HSV, EBV, HIV, Hepatitis A-D serology) and autoimmune work-up (ANA, anti DNA, anti smooth muscle, anti mitochondrial, SSA, SSB antibodies turned) were negative. PCR for Yellow fever virus was negative as well. Liver biopsy showed severe chronic active hepatitis (grade III) without fibrosis (grade 0) but with extensive periportal necroinflammatory changes, hence, a working diagnosis of SAIH was made.)  Final diagnosis was Mild seronegative autoimmune hepatitis  The patient was treated with 1 gm METHYLPREDNISOLONE SODIUM SUCCINATE (SOLUMEDROL) and PREDNISONE (PREDNISONE) 40 mg daily. They were able to taper her steroids in the next 4 months with maintenance treatment of 5mg Prednisone.  The outcome of the event was Unknown for all the events.  Conclusion: It is concluded that given the history of this patient, the possibility of association of yellow fever vaccine inducing acute flare of autoimmune hepatitis cannot be ruled out. Further studies to unearth this rare association in detail are warranted.  Information on the batch number was requested.; Sender's Comments: This literature article concerns 35 years old female patient who experienced autoimmune hepatitis, abdominal pain upper, jaundice and pyrexia after vaccination with YELLOW FEVER VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer. The time to onset is unknown. Lab data provided. Additional information regarding patient's past medical history, condition at the time of vaccination, other predisposing etiologies would be needed for complete assessment of the case.

The patient's historical conditions included bypass surgery. The patient's current conditions included hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient was administered unspecified Flu Vaccine [Influenza virus vaccine trivalent; anatomical location, route of administration, dose, batch number and expiration date: not reported] for an unknown indication.   On an unspecified date, the patient was administered co-suspect unspecified pneumococcal vaccine [pneumococcal vaccine; anatomical location, route of administration, dose, batch number and expiration date: not reported] for an unknown indication.  On an unspecified date, reported as 5 days after vaccination, the patient experienced flu-like symptoms and cyanosis. The patient developed non-palpable, purpuric lesions on his toes and fingers along with acral pain. He progressively had worsening purpura and digital ischemia along with livedo reticularis of both plantar surfaces.  On an unspecified date, within 4 weeks, the patient developed anorexia, night sweats, myalgias, fatigue and arthralgias. The patient refused biopsy. Laboratory evaluation found a normal complete blood count, normal urinalysis, normal comprehensive metabolic panel, negative antinuclear antibodies, negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, negative anticardiolipin antibodies, negative immunofixation electrophoresis, negative hepatitis A antibody, negative hepatitis B surface antigen, and negative hepatitis C antibody. The following test results were abnormal: rheumatoid factor was 24 IU/mL (reference range less than 20); total hemolytic complement level [CH50] was 28, units unspecified (reference range 60-185); C3 level was 75.50 mg/dL (reference range more than 78); C4 level was less than 1.67 mg/dL (reference range more than 16); Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 48 mm/h (reference range less than 20), high sensitive C-reactive protein was 5.24 mg/dL (reference range less than 4); anti-phosphatidylserine IgG was 19, units unspecified (reference range less than 11); and anti-phosphatidylserine IgM was 64, units unspecified (reference range less than 25). A chest radiograph and Doppler studies of blood flow of the extremities were also normal. Initial testing for cryoglobulins was negative. The patient was treated with oral prednisone at the dose of 20 mg, daily.  On an unspecified date, two weeks later, the patient's rheumatoid factor was 54 IU/mL. The dose for the prednisone was increased at the dose of 40 mg, administered once per day. The patient continued to develop new acral purpuric lesions and had increasing acral pain.   On an unspecified date, 6 weeks into his course, the patient was administered treatment medication rituximab intravenously, at a dose of 375 mg/mm2, weekly for a total of 4 infusions. Because of the limited clinical change, an additional 2 infusions of rituximab were given monthly.  On an unspecified date, at the end of fourth infusion of rituximab, cryoglobulins were detected for the first time.  On an unspecified date, roughly 3 months after last rituximab infusion, the patient's acral lesions healed. Prednisone at the dose of 40 mg, daily was continued throughout the first 3 months of the course and then slowly tapered and stopped 4 months after his last infusion of rituximab. His cryoglobulin level continued to be detectable.  On an unspecified date, 18 months after initial presentation, the patient had increasing acral ischemic symptoms. Elevated IgM level and low C4 level led to plans for another 4 rituximab infusions. However, before the second set of infusions, palpable purpura developed on his legs. Biopsy at this time found leukocytoclastic vasculitis, while direct immunofluorescence microscopy found IgG in the vessel walls. The patient was treated with oral prednisone at the dose of 40 mg daily, which was tapered and stopped over 3 weeks and his hematologist administered another 4 weekly infusions of intravenous rituximab. The patient was seen at Clinic (hematology), and a type II cryoglobulin was identified and characterized as IgM k monoclonal cryoglobulinemia with polyclonal IgG cryoglobulinemia. A bone marrow biopsy finding was normal.   On an unspecified date, twenty months after initial presentation, the patient began therapy with oral cyclophosphamide at the dose of 100 mg daily, and oral prednisone at the dose of 10 mg daily. His symptoms and clinical findings have been controlled with this regimen.  On an unspecified date, 3 years after the presentation, doses for the treatment medications were decreased to cyclophosphamide at the dose of 50 mg every other day, and prednisone at the dose of 5 mg daily. Although his symptoms and physical findings have remained controlled, his low level of C4 has persisted, and the patient was recovering from the events.  The case was assessed as serious.   The reporter assessed the event of type 2 mixed cryoglobulinemia as related to unspecified Flu vaccine while the causality assessment for the event of leukocytoclastic vasculitis was not reported. It was reported that it was not possible to ascertain which vaccine was responsible for the patient's disease, but it was more likely caused by viral vaccination. Although a causal link with the influenza vaccination cannot be proved by reporter's observation, they could speculate that based on the timing of the vaccination, constellation of symptoms, and positive laboratory results, influenza virus-induced cryoglobulinemia was the most probable cause of patient's symptoms.

On 12-NOV-2019, the subject was seen for his 6-month well child check. ^^During the clinic visit, his mother reported that a few weeks ago, the child started having episodes where he would be crying and then he would tighten his arms and his legs. This would only last for a few seconds and then he was fine. She reported that last week, the maternal grandmother noted that he did this, and eyes rolled to the back of his head and he seemed like he was not breathing. She blew in his face and then he started crying again. He was immediately fine after this and not lethargic or drowsy. At the WCC, the child was assessed as 6-month-old male with normal growth and development. The episodes of tightening his arms and legs were considered to be more like temper tantrums but it was discussed with the parent that if that was seizure, he would be needed to be evaluated further.^^ Moreover, the physician asked the mother to record a video of the seizures and they would be referred to a specialist for workup and possible treatment.  On 13-NOV-2019 at 13:15, the subject was in the grandmother's arms when he started crying and screaming for several seconds, his eyes rolled back, and he became limp and stopped breathing. The subject experienced seizure (severe). ^^There were no relevant signs / symptoms, apart from crying already noted, prior or concurrent to previous episodes of possible seizures^^. His grandmother took him to freestanding emergency room (ER) (outside the site facility). At the outside facility, the subject was found to be in asystole and apneic; became bradycardic down to 50's then coded. ^^On that day, his glucose was 246 mg/dl.^^ Cardio pulmonary resurrection (CPR) started with return of spontaneous circulation. He was transferred by ambulance to the site ER but lost the pulse again in route; 6 doses of epinephrine were administered prior to arrival. During transfer pulse less electrical activity noted and asystole on emergency medical services (EMS) monitors, CPR was performed while bagged, EMS attempted to intubate without success in route. An oral airway was placed and bilateral intraosseous lines in lower extremities. They arrived at the site ER with the subject in cardiac arrest and apneic. On arrival to the site, the subject was intubated, epinephrine, atropine, bicarbonate and naloxone (NARCAN) were administered ^^for cardiac arrest^^. An ultrasound for pulse check showed no cardiac activity. ^^It was reported that the subject was hospitalized^^. Core temperature was 94.6 Fahrenheit rectally, CRP continued with no success an at 14:19 (after 1 hour) the subject died due to ^^seizure^^ as per hospital records. ^^An autopsy was performed. No imaging testing to evaluate the seizures was carried out; no medications were given for previous episodes of possible seizures. The subject died in the ER before he could be admitted to the hospital; therefore, admission date, discharge date and discharge diagnosis were not applicable. There was no confirmed diagnosis of seizures prior to the day of death and no further information available regarding onset dates of 'episodes' reported by the mother^^. The action taken with the study therapies was reported as ^^dose not changed^^.  The investigator considered the seizure (severe) to be related to V114 or pneumococcal 13valent conjugate vaccine (CRM197) (PREVNAR 13), Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent (ROTATEQ), Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) (RECOMBIVAX HB), to diphtheria toxoid (+) Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (unspecified carrier) (+) pertussis acellular vaccine (unspecified) (+) poliovirus vaccine inactivated (unspecified) (+) tetanus toxoid (DTAP-IPV HIB) (PENTACEL) vaccine and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) (HIBERIX), but not related to the study procedure. ^^The investigator assessed the event related to administration of all vaccines due to temporal relationship and no other definitive cause of death^^. The investigator considered the seizure (severe) to be a life-threatening event.  Updated information received on 15-NOV-2019 from the investigator has been captured in between double caret (^^).  The record for this subject was unblinded on 18-NOV-2019. Company Causality Assessment: Although there is a family history of seizures and co-suspect use RECOMBIVAX HB (known to be associated with non-fatal seizure), based on the clinically relevant information currently available for this individual case, there is a possibility  that the reported serious adverse event of Seizure with a fatal outcome is related to the use of the investigational vaccines (blinded investigational vaccine [V114 or PREVNAR 13] and open-label study vaccine [PENTACEL and HIBERIX). The plausible temporal relationship, the known safety profiles of the blinded comparator (known to be associated with non-fatal seizure and apnea) and open label study vaccines (PENTACEL [known to be associated with non-fatal apnea] and HIBERIX [known to be associated with non-fatal convulsions]) support the possible relationship. Additional information regarding laboratory data due to increased glucose prior to CPR, autopsy report and the history of shoulder dystocia with unknown complications are needed for further assessment. Important missing information includes any record of fever accompanying the event. Febrile seizures have previously been reported in children who have received pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PREVNAR 13).  An Analysis of Similar Events regarding this follow up report of the adverse reaction of Seizure with the serious criteria of hospitalization, life threatening and death was performed. This case refers to a 6-month-old male subject who experienced Seizure after the third dose of the investigational vaccines (blinded investigational vaccine [V114 or pneumococcal 13 valent conjugate vaccine (CRM197) PREVNAR 13] and open label study vaccines [PENTACEL and HIBERIX]). This is the first reported case of Seizure in association with the investigational vaccines (blinded investigational vaccine [V114 or pneumococcal 13 valent conjugate vaccine (CRM197) PREVNAR 13] and open label study vaccines [PENTACEL and HIBERIX]) submitted to the FDA.     The Suspected Adverse Reactions of Seizure does not alter the existing benefit-risk profile of the product. Merck and Co., Inc., known as MSD outside of certain countries, will continue to monitor this event and other serious adverse events reported in association with V-114 and will communicate any relevant changes to the protocol, Investigator's Brochure and/or Core Safety Information.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Seizure",Y,11/13/2019,Y,,Y,,,,N,01/11/2019,11/13/2019,306,Test Date: 20191113; Test Name: glucose; Test Result:  246 mg/dl,UNK,,,Prophylaxis; Shoulder dystocia,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Seizures; Shoulder dystocia,,US0095075131911USA005567,2,11/21/2019,,,,

On 24th July 2019, 1 days after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced fever (serious criteria other: serious per reporter) and knee pain (serious criteria other: serious per reporter). In August 2019, the patient experienced shoulder pain (serious criteria other: serious per reporter). The patient was treated with naproxen (Aleve) and meloxicam.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the fever, knee pain and shoulder pain to be related to Shingrix.  Additional case details were reported as follows: The age at vaccination was not reported. The patient had a serious reaction to the first injection and asked to advise him or her. The patient enquired about getting the second injection or the timing of that second injection. A day later both knees hurt like crazy when going upstairs. The patient also had a fever of 101. These symptoms were faded over a couple of days, but several weeks later (mid-August) all large joints were quite painful including knees, hips and shoulders. Treating with Aleve was only partially effective in relieving the pain, so patient visited to Internist. The Internist prescribed Meloxicam 25 mg for 2 weeks and patient then refilled that for an additional 10 days. That round of medication was just completed and patient's joints were much improved, but not back to normal. The Internist had suggested pushing out the second injection as late as possible, and had also referred patient to a rheumatologist. Rheumatologists were apparently in hot demand as the first available appointment would not until February. The patient would like to see the rheumatologist prior to getting the second injection, but wondered how long between doses was acceptable, and whether had any additional advice. The patient never had any reaction to a vaccine other than at the site. Unless the rheumatologist felt it was not recommended based on the reaction to the first one. This had been quite scary as patient felt like it added about 15 years of age. The patient was sure hope it continued to improve and that did not regret getting the Shingrix for the rest of life.

The patient was identified from the medical history receiving hemodialysis and human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus coinfections. On unspecified date in 2012, the patient had an initiated of hemodialysis. At hemodialysis initiation at hospital A's outpatient clinic in 2012, his HBV serologic test results suggested a possible past resolved HBV infection with positive total anti-HBc (First known positive total anti-HBc on June 2012), positive anti-HBs ((before HBsAg seroconversion) October 2013), and negative HBsAg  (that First known negative HBsAg (June 2012); Last known negative HBsAg (July 2015). In December 2013, the patient lost HBV immunity and became anti-HBs negative while remaining HBsAg negative.  No information on patient's family history or concomitant condition was provided. On unspecified date in between July 2013 and August 2015, the patient was on hemodialysis (HD), the patient was on likely infectious and not on HBV isolation. On unspecified date in between December 2013 and June 2015, the patient potential exposure period was travel history. On unspecified date in August 2015, the patient had received unspecified Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date in August 2015, unknown period after vaccination, the patient �s HBV Isolation was initiated. During hospitalization for hemodialysis (2015), the patient had an HBV serology, which showed First known positive HBsAg (August 2015); First known negative anti- HBs (December 2015); Last known negative anti- HBs (August 2015). On an unspecified August 2015, the patient's HBV serology showed that the 3,945,000 copies/m. On an unspecified March 2013, the patient's Highest known ALT/AST: 241/148. Repeat HBV testing for inpatient dialysis during an August 2015 hospitalization showed a weakly-reactive HBsAg testing by platform such as abbott in January 2016: positive; Siemens Advia Centaur XP: HBs assay: weakly-positive (August 2015); HBsII assay: positive (December 2015) and HBs assay: negative (June 2015 and September 2015), However, subsequent HBsAg testing on VITROS (August 2015 and January 2016) platform was negative, while HBV DNA levels were 3,945,459 IU/mL. From this point onward, HBV isolation precautions were initiated for this patient. HBsAg mutation was suspected as a possible explanation for the negative HBsAg result with concurrent high HBV DNA levels. The patient did not performed other HBV testing's: such as HBV genotype (H) and HBV molecular sequencing. Testing at CDC revealed positive HBsAg with Abbott ARCHITECT platform and negative HBsAg with VITROS platform, suggesting that it was a presumed HBsAg mutant strain, although attempts to sequence HBV DNA were unsuccessful due to low HBV DNA levels (500 copies/mL) at that time. The investigation launched in September 2015 revealed that the case patient received dialysis at 2 out-of-state hemodialysis clinics A and B in June 2015. At out-of state hemodialysis clinic A, he was dialyzed in an HBV isolation room because of serologic test results demonstrating potential HBV infectivity (hepatitis B e antigen positive and HBsAg negative). However, he was not dialyzed in an HBV isolation room at out-of-state hemodialysis clinic B because he tested negative for HBsAg (on Siemens Advia Centaur XP platform, using Siemens HBs assay, not the newer HBsII assay). Screening of potentially exposed hemodialysis patients did not reveal new HBV infections. The case patient was treated for HBV infection and his last HBV DNA levels were very low. He continues to receive hemodialysis with HBV isolation precautions in place. This case considered as suspected vaccination failure due to onset time was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure. The author commented, ""To our knowledge, there has been no documented hemodialysis-related transmission of a mutant strain of HBV. Our patient had serologic evidence of previous HBV infection (total anti-HBc positive) before initiation of hemodialysis; therefore, their HBsAg seroconversions could have been the result of reactivation ofthan new infection."" The author concluded ""Mutant HBV infections should be suspected in patients who test HBsAg negative and concurrently test positive for HBV DNA at high levels. Dialysis providers should consider using HBsAg assays that can also detect mutant HBV strains for routine HBV testing."" This is 1 of the 2 valid cases reported in this literature article.
