(Co-suspect products included DTPa (Reduced antigen) (Tdap Vaccine) for prophylaxis.   Previously administered products included unspecified influenza vaccine (in the previous season).  On an unknown date, the patient received Flu vaccine at an unknown dose and Tdap Vaccine at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, less than 6 months after receiving Flu vaccine and Tdap Vaccine, the patient experienced spontaneous abortion (serious criteria GSK medically significant) and vaccine exposure during pregnancy. On an unknown date, the outcome of the spontaneous abortion and vaccine exposure during pregnancy were unknown. The pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion at less than 22 weeks gestation with no apparent congenital anomaly present.   The reporter considered the spontaneous abortion to be related to Flu vaccine and Tdap Vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This retrospective pregnancy case was reported in a literature article and described the �spontaneous abortion (SAB)' in a female patient aged between 18 and 44 years who was vaccinated with unspecified seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and unspecified tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (manufacturer unknown for both) during pregnancy (trimester unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to table 1 in this literature article. The patient was a part of case-control study that estimated the association between IIV administered in three recent influenza seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15) and SAB among women who were and were not vaccinated in the previous influenza season in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). [In this study, for the purposes of this report, it was referred to the VSD study of women pregnant in the 2005-06 or 2006-07 influenza seasons as IIV-SAB-1, the VSD study of women pregnant in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 influenza seasons as IIV-SAB-2, and the current VSD study of women pregnant in the 2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-15 influenza seasons as IIV-SAB-3. In IIV-SAB-3, the women who were pregnant during the 2012-13, 2013-14, or 2014-15 influenza seasons were included. In this study, 21 patients had history of type 1 or 2 diabetes, 83 patients had history of asthma, 31 had history of pre-existing hypertension, 5 patients had hashimoto's thyroiditis, 2 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, and 2 patients had multiple sclerosis. No patient had history of antiphospholipid syndrome and celiac disease. Out of 627 cases vaccinated in previous season: 346 were, 41 were, 4 were, 8 were native, 124 were and 36 were of other race. The ethnicity of 627 cases were: 428 were and 199 were. The occupation of 627 cases were: 122 were healthcare, 53 were education, 290 were of unspecified other occupation and occupation of 162 patients were unknown. 445 patients had history of 1 or more births (parity) and 513 patients had history of gravidity. 217 patients had history of 1 or more than 1 previous SAB and 74 patients had history of 2 or more than 2 previous SAB. 49 patients had history of alcohol during pregnancy and 21 patients had history of smoking during pregnancy]. The patient's pregnancy was confirmed using information abstracted from the medical record: obstetric ultrasound, clinic or hospital-based assay (e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin level), patient-reported test, and/or physician diagnosis. The patient's last menstrual period was on an unknown date and estimated date of delivery was on an unspecified. No information on patient's family history or concurrent condition was provided.  On an unspecified date between 1 August and 30 June during unspecified influenza season (2012-13 or 2013-14 or 2014-15), the patient received unspecified IIV and concomitantly received unspecified Tdap vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosages unknown; batch number not provided for both) during pregnancy (trimester unknown). It was reported that the patient had also received unspecified influenza vaccine in the previous season. [In this study, women were considered exposed only if the vaccine was administered before the reference date; it was classified women receiving influenza vaccines on or after the reference date as unexposed in all analyses. Less than 3% of IIV administered to the study population was quadrivalent; therefore, it did not differentiate trivalent and quadrivalent IIV exposures in the analysis]. The age at vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified dated between 1 September and 28 April during unspecified influenza season (2012-13 or 2013-14 or 2014-15), between 6 and less than 20 weeks of gestation and an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient had spontaneous abortion (SAB). [In this study, the SAB was confirmed by ultrasound or by clinical diagnosis in the absence of ultrasound results. The SAB date was based on the earliest clinical diagnosis for women without ultrasound results. The SAB date was defined as the LMP date plus the estimated gestational age at the time of the SAB]. The authors commented, ""In the context of safety, the results of this study lend support to the Practices recommendation for IIV at any time during pregnancy. It found no clear evidence of an association between IIV and SAB; reasons for the apparent discrepancy between IIV-SAB-2 and IIV-SAB-3 are unknown. There was no association found between SAB and influenza vaccination in the other risk windows, or when vaccine receipt was analyzed relative to date of conception."" The authors concluded, ""During these seasons it was found no association between IIV and SAB, including among women vaccinated in the previous season. These findings lend support to current recommendations for influenza vaccination at any time during pregnancy, including the first trimester."" This is 1 of the 2 valid cases reported in the same literature article.      Lab Comments: Lab test done on an unknown date.

On an unknown date, less than 6 months after receiving Flu vaccine and Tdap Vaccine, the patient experienced spontaneous abortion (serious criteria GSK medically significant) and vaccine exposure during pregnancy. On an unknown date, the outcome of the spontaneous abortion and vaccine exposure during pregnancy were unknown. The pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion at less than 22 weeks gestation with no apparent congenital anomaly present.   The reporter considered the spontaneous abortion to be related to Flu vaccine and Tdap Vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This retrospective pregnancy case was reported in a literature article and described the �spontaneous abortion (SAB)' in a female patient aged between 18 and 44 years who was vaccinated with unspecified seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and unspecified tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (manufacturer unknown for both) during pregnancy (trimester unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to table 1 in this literature article. The patient was a part of case-control study that estimated the association between IIV administered in three recent influenza seasons (2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15) and SAB among women who were and were not vaccinated in the previous influenza season in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). [In this study, for the purposes of this report, it was referred to the VSD study of women pregnant in the 2005-06 or 2006-07 influenza seasons as IIV-SAB-1, the VSD study of women pregnant in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 influenza seasons as IIV-SAB-2, and the current VSD study of women pregnant in the 2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-15 influenza seasons as IIV-SAB-3. In IIV-SAB-3, the women who were pregnant during the 2012-13, 2013-14, or 2014-15 influenza seasons were included. In this study, 21 patients had history of type 1 or 2 diabetes, 83 patients had history of asthma, 31 had history of pre-existing hypertension, 5 patients had hashimoto's thyroiditis, 2 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, and 2 patients had multiple sclerosis. No patient had history of antiphospholipid syndrome and celiac disease. Out of 627 cases vaccinated in previous season: 346 were white, 41 were black, 4 were native American or Aleutian, 8 were native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 124 were Asian and 36 were of other race. The ethnicity of 627 cases were: 428 were non-Hispanic and 199 were Hispanic. The occupation of 627 cases were: 122 were healthcare, 53 were education, 290 were of unspecified other occupation and occupation of 162 patients were unknown. 445 patients had history of 1 or more births (parity) and 513 patients had history of gravidity. 217 patients had history of 1 or more than 1 previous SAB and 74 patients had history of 2 or more than 2 previous SAB. 49 patients had history of alcohol during pregnancy and 21 patients had history of smoking during pregnancy]. The patient's pregnancy was confirmed using information abstracted from the medical record: obstetric ultrasound, clinic or hospital-based assay (e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin level), patient-reported test, and/or physician diagnosis. The patient's last menstrual period was on an unknown date and estimated date of delivery was on an unknown date. No information on patient's family history or concurrent condition was provided.  On an unspecified date between 1 August and 30 June during unspecified influenza season (2012-13 or 2013-14 or 2014-15), the patient received unspecified IIV and concomitantly received unspecified Tdap vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosages unknown; batch number not provided for both) during pregnancy (trimester unknown). It was reported that the patient had not received unspecified influenza vaccine in the previous seasons. [In this study, women were considered exposed only if the vaccine was administered before the reference date; it was classified women receiving influenza vaccines on or after the reference date as unexposed in all analyses. Less than 3% of IIV administered to the study population was quadrivalent; therefore, it did not differentiate trivalent and quadrivalent IIV exposures in the analysis]. The age at vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified dated between 1 September and 28 April during unspecified influenza season (2012-13 or 2013-14 or 2014-15), between 6 and less than 20 weeks of gestation and an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient had spontaneous abortion (SAB). [In this study, the SAB was confirmed by ultrasound or by clinical diagnosis in the absence of ultrasound results. The SAB date was based on the earliest clinical diagnosis for women without ultrasound results. The SAB date was defined as the LMP date plus the estimated gestational age at the time of the SAB]. The authors commented, ""In the context of safety, the results of this study lend support to the Practices recommendation for IIV at any time during pregnancy. It found no clear evidence of an association between IIV and SAB; reasons for the apparent discrepancy between IIV-SAB-2 and IIV-SAB-3 are unknown. There was no association found between SAB and influenza vaccination in the other risk windows, or when vaccine receipt was analyzed relative to date of conception."" The authors concluded, ""During these seasons it was found no association between IIV and SAB, including among women vaccinated in the previous season. These findings lend support to current recommendations for influenza vaccination at any time during pregnancy, including the first trimester.""

Early in the afternoon I began experiencing severe chills and by 5:00 pm I was on the couch.  My arm was sore and had a large red lump.  I checked my temperature at approximately 9:30 pm and had a fever of 102.4.  I treated the fever with ibuprofen and it persisted throughout the night.  My temperature came down to around 99 by 8:00 am on 9-7.  I phoned the clinic and advised medical staff of the problem.  I was told to use ice on the injection site and continue with ibuprofen if needed.  The redness and swelling in my arm continued to increase and remained hot to the touch. By the morning of 9-8 redness began developing in a secondary area of my left arm approximately 4"" below the injection site.  The initial spot was approximately the size of a quarter and continued to spread throughout the day.  Both areas remained red, sore and hot to the touch.  I continued applying ice to the arm as instructed.  On the morning of 9-9, I awoke to find the secondary area had grown in size to be approximately 4"" wide and 2 1/2"" to 3"" tall.  The areas were still very red, sore and hot to the touch.  I phoned the clinic once again to advise the medical providers of the change in the condition and was told I should be seen.  I visited the clinic that morning and was seen by two providers.  I was told that this was merely an injection site reaction and that it was ""normal"".  I was told to take antihistamines and continue icing.  An appointment was made for 9-13 if needed.  The pain in these areas did not subside and remained hot to the touch throughout 9-11.  The initial injection site was less red on 9-12 and I cancelled the appointment with the clinic.  The secondary site has been slow to recover with the lump and redness persisting through 9-23.  The skin then became flaky and discolored and there is an indentation approximately 1"" high and 4"" wide across my bicep with a lump directly below.  It appears there has been some type of tissue damage in this area and I do have continued pain and discomfort at this secondary site on my left arm.  I do not believe proper protocol was utilized in the administration of this vaccine.  The person administering the vaccine brought an uncovered syringe into the room, set it on the counter to look for a band aid, and stuck the opened band aid on her finger.  She was not wearing gloves and did not swab the injection site.  My deltoid was pinched tightly and the vaccine administered.  It was painful from the outset.  This was a stark contrast to the easy painless experience I had with the first vaccine two months prior.  I do not believe that large red hot areas encompassing most of the upper arm can be deemed a normal injection site reaction.  I was repeatedly told that the reaction was ""better than having the shingles"".  I disagree - I have had the shingles twice in the last four years and the fever and lingering pain in my arm has been worse.",,,,,,,,,,09/05/2019,09/06/2019,1,,PVT,,Levothyroxine 88mcg,Seasonal allergies,"Hypothyroidism, migraines",,,2,10/07/2019,,Y,,"Sulfa drugs, artificial sweeteners, MSG, walnuts, bell peppers"

The latter symptoms lasted one day, but the skin reaction continued and then abated by Day 6 (Sept. 24).    However on day 11 (Sept 29), I developed pain (my typical shingle pain of muscle ache/bruising sensation) R  posterior pain at C6 (between scapula and spine).  On Day 12, Sept 30, the pain started to radiate from C6 right spinal area down the arm to top of R upper forearm.   At this sign I started Valtrex Sept 30, which worked 2 times prior when initiated to mitigate pain and later lesion development.  However, after 7 days on Valtex the pain got worse and persisted.  There were only 2 skin papules - one near elbow at top of R forearm started around 10/1   and one at top of R wrist started around 10/6.

Co-suspect products included HBV (Engerix B adult) (batch number 9T25S, expiry date 3rd April 2020) for prophylaxis.   The patient's past medical history included feeling unwell, tiredness and pruritus. Previously administered products included Zyrtec (received dose of 10 to 20mg) and Allegra (received dose of 180 to 240mg). Concurrent medical conditions included chronic idiopathic urticaria.   On 10th June 2019, the patient received the 1st dose of Twinrix. On 19th July 2019, the patient received the 2nd dose of Engerix B adult. On 10th June 2019, less than an hour after receiving Twinrix and not applicable after receiving Engerix B adult, the patient experienced feeling bad. In July 2019, the patient experienced confusion. On 19th July 2019, the patient experienced wrong vaccine administered and inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered. On an unknown date, the patient experienced nausea, influenza like illness, pain and fatigue. In June 2019, the outcome of the feeling bad was recovered/resolved. On an unknown date, the outcome of the nausea, influenza like illness, pain, fatigue, confusion, wrong vaccine administered and inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the feeling bad, nausea, influenza like illness, pain and fatigue to be related to Twinrix. It was unknown if the reporter considered the confusion to be related to Engerix B adult.  Additional case details were reported as follows: The patient was not feeling well, complaining of tired and itching, which she had a history of.  The patient advised to come back in a few days, which she did and only received Engerix as her second dose of Twinrix series, which led to wrong vaccine administered and inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered. The patient was planning a trip to and also had to get a yellow fever vaccine, so she saw in a other location, which was where the group was located that she was traveling with. The physician informed patient that she now needed to receive an adolescent dose of Havrix because she needs that vaccine due to the fact that she didn't get it for the second dose of Twinrix, as only Engerix B was given. With the first dose of Twinrix, within in 1 hour of the shot, patient felt bad for 36 hours.  Less than a 2 months after vaccination, the patient had nausea, felt like she had the flu, achiness, and fatigue. The Twinrx (Hepatitis A/Hepatitis B combo shot), patient received the combo Hepatitis A/Hepatitis B first dose in June at her local neighborhood Pharmacy.  The pharmacist administering the shot told her to return in 1 month for 2nd dose and then 6 months for 3rd. When she returned, different pharmacist (the lead pharmacist at this location) told her that she didn't really need the Hepatitis B at all (that it was optional) and that she just needed 2nd Twinrx at 6 months. She said they never give the 2nd shot as Twinrx at one month in a 3 shot sequence - just Hepatitis B.  She then recommended the Hepatitis B shot which she returned to same pharmacy a few days later to get. On the day of reporting, patient was told by a doctor who specializes in that she would not have lifetime immunity on this schedule but this could be remedied if she receive an adolescent dose of hepatitis A. Less than a month, after vaccination the patient was so confused and do not know what should to do. The reporter informed patient she should now receive an adolescent dose of Havrix because she only got Engerix for the 2nd dose.

Pediatrician actually noted at July physical how healthy he and his brother are, only seeing them yearly.

Breathing irregularity subsides w/in 20 min.  Headache continues for 3 days, called ped office, was told this is normal. Can give Motrin- did not. Headahce continues on and off for the last 2 weeks-rec'd Motrin at school.  Stomach pains still continues today, over 3 weeks later.  He cried when I had to pick him up sick 9/19 and he missed 9/20. He missed his first assembly at the very school he's longed to attend since he was 2. The very school that is forced to enforce the ridiculous mandates.   He has had no less than 30 visits to the school nurse for stomach pains, all documented- temperature check, water, ice for headache, comfort, encouragement to use the restroom. His teacher is scrambling to help him at school, ease his discomfort. Tracking complaints, suggestions and supports provided and outcomes. Mints, comfort, snacks, walk.  He has had no changes in his diet, his routine, his water in take has been increased. NOTHING has changed,  in preparation for introducing more chemicals into his body than it's ever been faced with in his entire 5 yrs combined.  He takes daily vitamin C, D3, probiotic and has since the beginning of school, in preparation for this. None of those were new, simply given more consistently.  On 10/2 I pick him up from school early, he sobs missing more school. We visit the pediatrician who suggests bloodwork and xray to rule out constipation despite the fact he's been stooling regularly and had just gone at the office.  He sobs again, trying to say that he was just kidding his stomach doesn't hurt. He doesn't need a blood draw, he's fine.  He sobs through the blood draw. Then we go for xrays. XRays show ""quite a bit of stool in his colon"" but there is no comparison or baseline for that.  The fact that we eat a clean, heathy diet, where he has regular stools and eats an extensive amount of food for his age and weight bares no impact on diagnosis. We are directed to get magnesium citrate and give 2.5-4oz to produce stooling.  Give him upwards of 4oz and nothing as he's sobbing again there is no more I just want! At school 10/3 complains consistently of stomach stating it's worse. Upon arrival home from school, give him remaining 6 oz of mag citrate and a saline suppository. He is sobbing, screaming. He stools, but nothing indicating any blockage.  10/4 Dr suggested mag citrate again to ensure no constipation. 6oz more.

Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at one minute was 8 and at five minutes was 9. The neonate had no MCMs identified at birth.  At the time of initial reporting, the outcome of the event of low birth weight was not reported.  The case was assessed as serious and the reporter did not provide causality assessment.  This case is linked to the case 201905078 (the corresponding maternal pregnancy report).; Sender's Comments: Reportedly, the female neonate subject was delivered as low birth weight baby after foetal exposure during pregnancy with the suspect product Flucelvax QIVc. Chronology is plausible. Mother's medical history of trichomonas and tobacco use may provide alternative aetiology for the event. Causality was also confounded by use of concomitant drug, Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride). Foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related per company conventions. Causal relationship between the suspect product and the event low birth weight baby is assessed as unlikely related.",,,,,,,,,Y,10/09/2018,01/30/2019,113,,PVT,,PRENATAL VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;BETACAROTENE;CALCIUM SULFATE;COLECALCIFEROL;CYANOCOBALAMIN;FERROUS ; ZOLOFT,,Comments: None.,,USSEQIRUS201905077,2,10/10/2019,,,,

A 35-year-old female, full-time health care worker at a 244-bed hospital, weighing 135 pounds, with no significant past medical or surgical history, presented to the hospital employee health service (EHS) approximately 1 hour after receiving unspecified Flu Vaccine [Influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, anatomical location: left upper arm, route of administration, dose, batch number and expiration date: not reported] to promote large scale immunization in the hospital workforce.   Immediately after the vaccine administration, the health care worker felt pressure and intense pain in the left shoulder, localized to its anterior aspect. In a numerical pain rating scale, with 0 representing ""no pain at all"" and 10 representing ""the worst pain ever possible,"" in this case, pain was self-rated as 10 out of 10. By 1 hour, this evolved to stiffness and difficulty moving the left arm at the shoulder. At self-referral to the EHS, pain was described as ""achy."" The health care worker had received an annual influenza vaccination over 10 years of employment without previously experiencing similar symptoms. The health care worker recalled that the vaccination had been administered by a nurse using a 20-gauge, 1.5-inch needle and was concerned that the vaccination placement was ""too high in my shoulder''. Any coincident recent shoulder trauma, excessive pulling, lifting overhead, or leisure activities (e.g., racquet sports, swimming) were denied by the worker.  Upon inspection by an occupational medicine physician, there was no visible bruising, erythema, or swelling noted on the left shoulder. Pain was exacerbated by shoulder manipulation, most notably with abduction and flexion. Active range of motion was limited to 45 degrees with forward flexion and extension. Reflexes, strength, and sensation were intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast was performed within 1 week of injury and demonstrated a moderate glenohumeral joint effusion and synovitis, with fluid accumulating in the subscapularis recess, in addition to changes consistent with a moderate biceps' tenosynovitis. The health care worker was treated conservatively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (Ibuprofen) and 5% lidocaine patch, placed on modified work duty, prescribed physical therapy, and referred for orthopedic specialist consultation, and to our knowledge, she has been adherent to this plan.  Over the next several weeks, the health care worker came in for regular weekly follow-up visits at the EHS, where she was seen by an occupational medicine trainee, with input from an occupational health nurse practitioner and a second occupational medicine physician. The patient reported ongoing (4 out of 10) dull pain at rest, sleep disturbance due to pain, and difficulty lifting, carrying, and especially driving. On physical examination 4 weeks after the injury, left deltoid pain was still appreciable with restricted abduction (45 degrees) as well as pain upon passive abduction and flexion. Findings by the physical therapist were also consistent with the observed limited range of motion. The health care worker continued to be on modified duty and use nonsteroidal pain medication. Six weeks after the injury, the health care worker had completed six sessions of physical therapy with substantially improved range of motion, although not yet to baseline, and a pain level was rated as 3 out of 10. At that time, a second MRI demonstrated near-complete resolution of the glenohumeral joint effusion but changes consistent with tenosynovitis of the extraarticular portion of the biceps' tendon remained. A third MRI was performed 8 months after initial date of injury, showing persistent mild tenosynovitis of the long head of the biceps tendon, interval accumulation of a large glenohumeral joint effusion, and infraspinatus tendinitis with subjacent reactive bone marrow edema. The health care worker remained on modified duty (no overhead reaching on the left, no lifting or pushing with the left arm) and continued to receive physical therapy for at least 8 months since the initial injury with ongoing limitation to the left shoulder range of motion and persistent shoulder pain (3 out of 10). The health care utilization associated with managing this worker's injury included multiple physical therapy sessions, consultations with specialty providers, pharmacologic therapies, and several imaging studies. The affected employee experiences ongoing work restrictions but, to date, has had no complete lost workdays due to the injury.  Discussion: This case of SIRVA illustrates its associated morbidity in an occupational setting. Although there were no lost workdays and we do not have access to the health care related charges or costs in this case, there was considerable utilization of resources and an ongoing work restriction. Tenosynovitis and joint effusions occur in approximately 70% to 80% of SIRVA cases and bone marrow edema in 30% to 50% of cases, which is consistent with the findings of our case. Shoulder symptoms related to SIRVA can persist from 6 months to years. The case continued under the care of an orthopedic specialist and physical therapist exceeding 6 months of ongoing treatment.  Contributing Factors: This preventable injury and its subsequent sequalae can result from any one or multiple of the following factors: (a) inadequate training of the vaccine administering clinical staff; (b) use of an inappropriately sized needle (gauge and length); (c) deficits in knowledge of anatomical structures, leading to poor selection of the injection site; and (d) failure by health care providers to recognize the symptoms of vaccine misadministration. Lack of immediate referral for medical follow-up may contribute to resultant morbidity. The CDC has developed specific guidelines focused on training and educating health care staff administering vaccines and recommends that a 1-inch, 22- to 25-gauge needle be used for both men and women weighing 130-152 pounds when administering influenza vaccine (CDC, 2019). In this specific case, the level of training provided to the health care staff who administered the influenza vaccine was unclear and a larger than recommended 20-gauge, 1.5-inch needle was used. A diagnosis of SIRVA is suspected when the person who has been vaccinated experiences shoulder pain and decreased range of motion within 48 hours of receiving a ""very high"" deltoid injection. Most often, the shoulder pain does not respond to a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and may require corticosteroid injections into the shoulder. Of note, plain radiographs are often unrevealing. Ultrasound examination or, as in this case, MRI may reveal effusion and changes consistent with tendonitis. The most common vaccines associated with SIRVA are the seasonal influenza and tetanus immunization. This is likely because these vaccines are most commonly administered to adults. Regarding health care workers, the annual influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality, work absence, and infection transmission to patients.; Sender's Comments: The patient developed tenosynovitis and shoulder injury related to vaccine administration after vaccination with the suspect product, INN Flu Vaccine. Chronology seems plausible. Reportedly, the health care worker recalled that the vaccination had been administered by a nurse using a 20-gauge, 1.5-inch needle and was concerned that the vaccination placement was ""too high in my shoulder"", suggesting wrong technique in product usage process and that the product was administered at inappropriate site. There is a lack of information provided regarding patient's medical history. Causal relationship between the suspect product and the events of wrong technique in product usage process and product administered at inappropriate site is assessed as not related based on company's conventions, while for other two events is assessed as possibly related.",,,,,,,,,N,,,,"Test Name: Magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: Moderate glenohumeral joint effusion and synovitis, with fluid accumulating in the subscapularis recess, consistent with a moderate biceps tenosynovitis; Test Name: Magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: Near-complete resolution of the glenohumeral joint effusion changes consistent with tenosynovitis of the extraarticular portion of the biceps tendon remained; Test Name: Magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: Showing persistant mild tenosynovitis of the long head of the biceps tendon, interval accumulation of a large glenohumeral joint effusion, and infraspinatus tendinitis with subjacent reactive bone marrow edema",UNK,,,,,,USSEQIRUS201904849,2,10/10/2019,,,,

Her death makes no sense and we have not been provided with any answers from medical professionals.  In a nutshell, my sister started having minor pain in her head (ear area) in early June 2019, exactly two weeks after receiving the TDAP booster shot. The nerve pain that she had been experiencing had progressed to an unbearable state within a few short months. Before all this happened, she was a healthy, active woman.  She was never officially diagnosed with an illness/disease because her neurologist was not able to find an underlying cause after subjecting her to every logical test available. She was prescribed with pain medication, but the pain became too intense for her to bear. The doctor suggested that she might be suffering with Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN) condition, but it was just a suggestion.  In just a few short months the symptoms progressed to the point where she felt burning pain throughout her entire body.  The pain was transient and intense. She was desperate for relief and answers. Approximately four weeks before her death her symptoms progressed to affect her autoimmune system and she began to have trouble swallowing, producing tears, breathing, heart palpitations, and digestive issues. She believed that she would not survive this pain and accompanying symptoms (she feared the autoimmune symptoms). After her own online research and was convinced that all these symptoms were as a result of a reaction, she had from the TDAP booster.  Everything she believed that was going to happen to her, did. I wonder if she was also right about the TDAP booster shot being the catalyst for her ultimate death.  Her body is with the coroner now and we are awaiting the autopsy report to understand the cause of death but I am wondering if there are any tests that can be performed that could determine if the TDAP  played any role in the symptoms she was experiencing as described above and her ultimate, untimely, early death.  Please call me so I can provide additional information. She visited the neurologist only twice and was told that her blood tests were perfect...all of the blood tests that were given to her came out clean.

She then later realized some slight swelling in the throat, but nothing too severe to go to the emergency room and felt better in a couple of days.

On an unknown date, the patient received FluLaval Quadrivalent at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, less than a month after receiving FluLaval Quadrivalent, the patient experienced cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (serious criteria GSK medically significant), dyspnea (serious criteria hospitalization), cough (serious criteria hospitalization), acute respiratory failure (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and general physical health deterioration. The patient was treated with antibiotics nos (Antibiotics (Brand Names Not Known)), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solumedrol) and prednisone. On an unknown date, the outcome of the cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, dyspnea, cough, acute respiratory failure, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and general physical health deterioration were recovered/resolved.   The reporter considered the cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, dyspnea, cough, acute respiratory failure, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and general physical health deterioration to be related to FluLaval Quadrivalent.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) in a male patient aged 65-year-old who was vaccinated with Flulaval quadrivalent vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis. The patient was a male. No information on patient's medical or family history or concomitant medication or concurrent condition was provided.  On an unspecified date in 2016, the patient received Flulaval quadrivalent vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided but it could be 64 or 65 year. The patient had no immediate adverse effects. On an unspecified date, within a month after vaccination, the patient developed the symptoms of COP. A month after vaccination, the patient was hospitalized with dyspnea and cough leading to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patient was started on non-invasive ventilation and antibiotics. Patient's clinical condition deteriorated with worsening of bilateral infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed acute inflammatory cells with cultures being negative. Right upper lobe wedge biopsy showed COP. Patient was started on intravenous (IV) Solumedrol and transitioned to high dose oral prednisone. 1 week later, the patient was clinically better. Prednisone was continued 3 months more and then discontinued. Repeat computed tomography (CT) chest with contrast showed resolution of the infiltrates. In 2017, (a year later after the initial presentation), the patient received Fluzone vaccine (inactivated quadrivalent vaccine) and had no immediate complications. Within a month after vaccination, the patient again developed symptoms of COP. One month after vaccination, the patient presented with weakness, dyspnea, fever, hemoptysis and cough. Imaging showed patchy bilateral multifocal infiltrates Infectious etiology was ruled out. Based on the similarities to patient's presentation a year ago, COP secondary to the inactivated quadrivalent vaccine was felt likely and patient was started on steroids. Chest x-ray showed improved aeration bilaterally with eventual clearing of infiltrates. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The author commented ""The patient had biopsy proven COP in the first instance. A year later, the temporal relationship to the influenza vaccination, the similar clinical picture, absence of infection and the response to steroids made this presumptively COP. Both instances were within 1 month of receiving an inactivated quadrivalent flu vaccine. Despite this possible complication, Influenza vaccine is necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality in susceptible individuals"".  The authors concluded ""We present this rare complication of influenza vaccination to increase clinician awareness of this condition. COP due to influenza vaccination can be serious; however, early intervention and diagnosis can be key to preventing further complications. Despite this possible complication, Influenza vaccine is necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality in susceptible individuals.""

When exposed to flu strains at any time after the injection I would get a muscle spasm in the neck, randomly one side or the other, never both sides. The spasm is a painful stiffness and muscle spasm of the type that can be caused by sleeping with the wrong pillow. But these spasms are not helped or treated by use of heat, cold, massage or muscle relaxers. They started out lasting 8 hours to 24 hours but now they are one to ten days. They stop with immediate activation of flu symptoms such as sensitive skin, feverish feeling, diarrhea or elevated body temperature. I used to get one neck spasm per year most of my life with sleeping position but it started becoming a predictable symptom that I was exposed to the flu. In layman's terms the flu 'hibernates' in my neck muscles for a varied length of time and generally the longer I had the stiff neck the less severe the flu symptoms would be when the spasm suddenly stopped and attenuated flu symptoms appeared. I believe the vaccinations are helping me to avoid severe flu symptoms as I never lost time from work or became bed ridden by seasonal flue since starting annual vaccine doses. My last two episodes this year was severe neck spasm 8 months ago that left me totally incapacitated for a day. Moving my body at all caused horrible neck pain like neck muscles were tearing apart. I was having treatments for a dental abscess at the same time and neck spasms in the dentist chair hindered treatment but two days later mild flu symptoms suddenly appeared as neck pain vanished.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the rotaviral gastroenteritis, vomiting and vaccine virus shedding were unknown.   The reporter considered the rotaviral gastroenteritis, vomiting and vaccine virus shedding to be related to Rotarix liquid formulation.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of rotavirus associated acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and prolonged vaccine virus shedding in a patient aged between 2 months and 6-month-old of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a part of longitudinal, prospective cohort study of children undergoing allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) at 4 hospitals to better understand the epidemiology and etiologies of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in pediatric HCT patients in the early post-HCT period from March 2015 through May 2016. [In this study, 31 patients were enrolled out of which:18 were male; 15 had matched, 8 had mismatched and 8 had haploidetical; 8 had cord blood as cell source, 9 had apheresed stem cell, 14 had bone marrow and 16 had receipt of intravenous immune globulin; 14 had re-admission in first 100 days, 50 had days post-hematopoetic cell transplant, 2 had re-admission for AGE, 16 had total body irradiation received]. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.  On unspecified date at the age of 2 months, the patient received 1 dose of Rotarix (batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, after vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).  On an unknown date from March 2015 through May 2016, an unknown period after vaccination, before HCT or on the day of HCT, the patient's stool sample was collected. The sample was found positive for rotavirus by RT-PCR. No AGE symptoms were reported at that time. Almost at the age of 6 months, the patient was admitted to the hospital underwent allogenic HCT. 1 and 2-week post-HCT, the patient had diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's stool sample was collected 2-week post-HCT and tested by RT-PCR. The patient was found positive for rotavirus. The patient was diagnosed with rotavirus associated-AGE. [In this study, AGE was defined as unexplained diarrhea more than equal to 3 episodes in a 24-hour period and/or unexplained (i.e. not related to medication, mucositis, or other identifiable cause) vomiting more than equal to 1 episode in a 24-hour period. In patients with chronic vomiting and diarrhea, an unexplained doubling of the number of episodes of vomiting or diarrhea was considered consistent with AGE. The end of an AGE episode was defined as the return to stooling or emesis pattern prior to episode]. Rotavirus vaccine virus strain was confirmed in the sample by genotyping. The patient reported no AGE symptoms 3-week post-HCT. 4 and 5-week post-HCT, the patient reported diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's stool sample was collected 5-week post-HCT and tested by RT-PCR. The sample was positive for Rotarix vaccine virus strain. The patient reported no AGE symptoms 6-week post-HCT. 7 and 8-week post-HCT, the patient reported diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's stool sample was not collected at that time. The patient reported no AGE symptoms 9-week post-HCT. 10, 11 and 12-week post-HCT, the patient reported no AGE symptoms. The patient's stool sample was collected after each week respectively. The samples were found positive for Rotarix vaccine virus strain. 13 and 14-week post-HCT, the patient reported no AGE symptoms and no stool sample was collected at that time. The patient received broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including a parenterally administered beta-lactam agent with anti-Pseudomonal coverage during the study. [In this study, 16 patients received intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) during the study. 5 patients who received IVIG had a pathogen detected compared with 8 patients who did not receive IVIG. 7 patients with pathogen detections developed gut GVHD compared with 9 patients without pathogen detection. 11 patients with pathogen detection developed any GVHD compared with 12 of those without pathogen detection].  The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of rotavirus associated acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and Rotarix. The authors concluded ""In summary, our prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort of transplant recipients highlights the importance of testing for a wide range of enteric pathogens and corroborates previous data that show that prolonged shedding of viral pathogens can occur in immunocompromised hosts. Our data also emphasize that subsequent detections of the same pathogen may represent new infection, as noted in the patient with 2 adenovirus types. In this HCT cohort, infection was self-limited and not associated with high morbidity. Our findings reinforce the recognized challenges in interpreting C. difficile test-positive results in high-risk hosts with, and without, associated symptomatology. Despite the small nature of this pilot study, these data will inform further design and direction of AGE studies that can more precisely assess the etiology of AGE in this vulnerable population.""

The subject's obstetrical history included four previous pregnancies with one full term live birth, two spontaneous abortions and one elective abortion. No birth defects were reported. Also, the subject had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations. The subject did not have a prior history of use of alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The subject was a smoker (10 cigarettes per day). The subject's medical history included pulmonary venous thrombosis, asthma, hypothyroidism, advanced maternal age and high body mass index (28.8). Concomitant medications included prenatal vitamin (minerals NOS, vitamins NOS) for pregnancy, ProAir HFA (salbutamol sufate) and Pulmicort (budesonide) both for asthma, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, enoxaparin for pulmonary venous thrombosis and vitamin D2 as a supplement.

Previously administered products included immunization (immunizations were up to date).   On an unknown date, the patient received Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine (potential Menveo) at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine (potential Menveo), the patient experienced fever, headache, rash, joint pain and irritability. The patient was treated with amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (Amoxicillin + Clavulanate). On an unknown date, the outcome of the fever, headache, rash, joint pain and irritability were unknown.   The reporter considered the fever, headache, rash, joint pain and irritability to be related to Meningococcal ACWY Vaccine (potential Menveo).  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of fever and headache in a 12-year-old male patient who was vaccinated with unspecified quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was previously healthy and his immunizations were up to date. The patient and his family resided in a single-family. No information on patient's concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received 1st dose of unspecified quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient presented with a 5-day history of fever to 103 deg. F and rash. The patient had also reported headache. On the first day of illness, the patient was evaluated by his pediatrician who recommended a 10-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate. Five days into therapy, the patient continued to have fever, worsening of rash (spreading from his hands and arms to his trunk and legs), and new onset joint pain and irritability. The patient's pediatrician recommended inpatient evaluation. The outcome of the event was not reported. The authors did not comment on relation between the events and unspecified quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. However, the authors stated, ""Fever and headache in a fully vaccinated adolescent"". This article is not available for regulatory submission due to copyright restriction.   Follow up information received from the physician on 15th October 2019: The family had a dog and a cat, both of which spent time outside where they were exposed to raccoons and opossums. The patient reported occasional ingestion of pasteurized imported cheeses. Three weeks before the onset of symptoms, he had gone camping where he was exposed to numerous insects. On an unspecified date, 3 weeks after the onset of the symptoms, the patient had an examination, he was febrile (101.5 degree F), photophobic, and agitated. The patient was in distress, crying, and asking for the examination lights to be turned off. He had pain with flexion of his neck and negative Kernig's/Brudzinski's signs. The patient was tachycardic with no murmurs and tachypneic with no adventitious sounds in the lung fields. His left ankle was swollen with decreased range of motion secondary to pain. A fine, nonblanching, petechial rash was noted on his trunk, notably on the hands and elbow (extremities)and throughout the patient's body. The patient had defervesced within 2 days of initiation of antimicrobials. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a complete blood count with 12 600 white blood cells/mm3 (63 percent segmented neutrophils, 25 percent bands, 3 percent lymphocytes, 9 percent monocytes), hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, and platelets 167 000 platelets/�L. Blood chemistries revealed hyponatremia (serum sodium 126 mEq/L), and liver function tests showed mild transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase of 41 and 61 U/L, respectively). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 239 white blood cells/mm3 with (74 percent neutrophils) 2 red blood cells/mm3, protein 47 mg/dL, and glucose 55 mg/dL. His clinical presentation and laboratory evaluation were consistent with meningitis. Blood and CSF cultures were obtained and additional tests for influenza (nasal wash), human metapneumovirus (nasal wash), adenovirus (nasal wash), enterovirus (CSF polymerase chain reaction), Epstein-Barr virus (serology), arboviridae (serology), and tick/flea-borne (serology) etiologie were performed. The patient was admitted to the inpatient pediatric service where he was initially treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone pending Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bacterial cultures. Doxycycline was initiated given the concern for Rickettsia typhi infection given his recent travel to an area of high endemicity. The patient had defervesced 36 hours after admission and he continued ceftriaxone and doxycycline for 5 and 10 days, respectively (i.e at day 1, the temperature was about 101.7 deg. F, at day 2, it was around 101.1 deg. F deg. F, at day 3, around 101.5 deg. F, at day 4, it was around, 99.9 deg. F, day 5, it was around 99.2 deg. F and day 6, it was around 98.8 deg. F). Bacterial cultures and viral studies from admission were negative; vancomycin was discontinued after CSF cultures showed no growth at 48 hours. Because he was pretreated with amoxicillin/clavulanate before his evaluation, he received ceftriaxone for 5-days for empiric meningococcal meningitis treatment, although this diagnosis was thought to be unlikely given the patient's duration of illness at the time of admission. Despite negative R typhi and Rickettsia rickettsia serologies, his rapid improvement on doxycycline was clinically consistent with rickettsial infection, so he was discharged home to complete a 10-day course of therapy.  This case has been considered serious due to hospitalization. The patient returned to clinic 1 month after his initial presentation; at that time, he had returned to school and was well with no recrudescence of fever or other symptomatology. Repeat R typhi serology was negative, as was testing for Coxiella burnetti. The authors commented, ""Other than R rickettsii, Rickettsia species as a cause of meningitis in children is rare; however, it has been reported in children with consistent clinical exposure history."" The author concluded, ""When a rickettsial illness is suspected, it is important to collect both acute and convalescent serum, because seroconversion can be missed if testing is performed too early in the time course of infection. Furthermore, when a patient's exposure and clinical history are consistent with a rickettsial infection, empiric treatment is warranted before laboratory confirmation. Our patient had negative R typhi serologies on both acute and convalescent serum, suggesting perhaps an alternative diagnosis. His arthritis and rash could support a diagnosis of N meningitides meningitis; however, the arthritis associated with meningococcus is typically immune-mediated and presents days after and not with meningeal signs. His clinical presentation and rapid improvement on doxycycline are consistent with a rickettsial illness; however, infection due to other flea/tick-borne pathogens would have responded to this agent as well. The recent increase in R typhi infections guided our initial microbiologic evaluation; however, this focused approach did not include testing for Ehrlicia chaffeensis, which, although rare, is also consistent with his clinical presentation. Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia felis are a consideration as well, and although there is a high-level of cross reactivity with serologic tests for R typhi, these etiologies may have been missed without specific testing.""      Lab Comments: Lab test done on an unknown date. The patient clinical presentation and laboratory evaluation were consistent with meningitis.  Blood and CSF cultures were obtained and additional tests for influenza (nasal wash), human metapneumovirus (nasal wash), adenovirus (nasal wash), enterovirus (CSF polymerase chain reaction), Epstein-Barr virus (serology), arboviridae (serology), and tick/flea-borne (serology) etiologie were performed. Despite negative R typhi and Rickettsia rickettsia serologies, his rapid improvement on doxycycline was clinically consistent with rickettsial infection.

Co-suspect products included Flu unspecified (Influenza vaccine) for prophylaxis, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine for prophylaxis and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE for prophylaxis.   The patient's past medical history included swelling (of a digit from his left hand, at the age of 4 weeks), skin lesion (multiple recurrent), blister, ulcer, inflammation (dermal perivascular and interstitial), anemia (hemoglobin count: 6.8-10.4 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 36-130 x10e3/�L), fever (high), ischemia (of his digits and toes), sepsis (ischemic changes of his digits and had multiple admissions to the hospital for suspected sepsis), failure to thrive, respiratory symptom (at the age of 7 months), pneumonia (at the age of 7 months and admitted twice to the hospital), ill-defined disorder (diffuse parenchymal and interstitial abnormalities , at the age of 7 month), inflammation (at the age of 7 month), focal seizures and gliosis (MRI revealed multiple areas in the superior vermis, occipital lobe and right thalamus). Previously administered products included corticosteroids, sildenafil (0.5 mg/kg daily (3.7 mg per day) with partial response), ruxolitinib (1 mg twice daily) and JANUS kinase (JAK) inhibitor (1 mg twice daily). Concurrent medical conditions included peripheral ischemia, vascular disorder (stimulator of interferon genes associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy, at the age of 8 months) and immunocompromised.   On an unknown date, the patient received Pediarix at an unknown dose, Influenza vaccine at an unknown dose, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine at an unknown dose and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, less than 9 months after receiving Pediarix, Influenza vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the patient experienced fever (serious criteria hospitalization), oral intake reduced (serious criteria hospitalization), injection site blisters (serious criteria hospitalization), injection site ulcer (serious criteria hospitalization), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (serious criteria hospitalization), nephrotic syndrome (serious criteria GSK medically significant), glomerular vascular disorder (serious criteria GSK medically significant), pulmonary fibrosis (serious criteria GSK medically significant), peripheral ischemia (serious criteria hospitalization), condition aggravated (serious criteria hospitalization), generalized edema, proteinuria, blood pressure high, hyperplasia, hypertrophy, atrophy, inflammation, scar and swelling. The patient was treated with enalapril, methylprednisolone and ruxolitinib. On an unknown date, the outcome of the fever, oral intake reduced, injection site blisters, injection site ulcer, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, glomerular vascular disorder, pulmonary fibrosis, peripheral ischemia, condition aggravated, generalized edema, proteinuria, blood pressure high, hyperplasia, hypertrophy, atrophy, inflammation, scar and swelling were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the fever, oral intake reduced, injection site blisters, injection site ulcer, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, glomerular vascular disorder, pulmonary fibrosis, peripheral ischemia, condition aggravated, generalized edema, proteinuria, blood pressure high, hyperplasia, hypertrophy, atrophy, inflammation, scar and swelling to be related to Pediarix, Influenza vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of fever and poor oral intake in a 14-month-old male, who was vaccinated with Pediarix vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline), unspecified pneumococcal vaccine (manufacturer unknown), unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown), and unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  The patient was boy and one of fraternal twins. At the age of 4 weeks, the patient was presented with swelling of a digit from his left hand. The patient subsequently developed multiple recurrent skin lesions, characterized by blisters that progressed to ulcers. Skin biopsy was performed which showed dermal perivascular and interstitial inflammation with vasculopathy. The patient also developed recurrent ischemic changes of his digits and toes. Initial laboratory evaluation showed persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers and unexplained anemia (hemoglobin, 6.8-10.4 g/dL). The patient was subsequently developed thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 36-130 x10e3/�L), elevated ferritin level (630-21,804 ng/mL), prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and low fibrinogen level (1.06-1.80 g/L) that was concerning for macrophage activation syndrome. The patient was initially treated with high-dose corticosteroids followed by a slow tapering dose and 0.5 mg/kg daily of sildenafil (3.7 mg per day), with partial response. The patient continued to develop skin lesions associated with high fevers and ischemic changes of his digits and had multiple admissions to the hospital for suspected sepsis in an immunocompromised patient. The patient also had failure to thrive. At 7 months of age, the patient developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted twice to the hospital for pneumonia. Computed tomography of the chest showed diffuse parenchymal and interstitial abnormalities and findings suggestive of both acute and chronic inflammation. At the age of 8 months, the diagnosis of stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) was made by targeted genetic testing of transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), which showed a heterozygous variant predicted to lead to a valine to leucine substitution at amino acid 147 (V147L). Genetic testing for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), periodic fever syndromes, and deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 was negative. Based on these findings, the patient was started on treatment with ruxolitinib, a JANUS kinase (JAK) inhibitor, 1 mg twice daily. The development of new skin lesions became less frequent, as well as the frequency of hospitalizations. The ruxolitinib dose was increased to 2.5 mg and the patient did well for a few months before an acute episode of focal seizures. At that time, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple areas suggestive of gliosis in the superior vermis, occipital lobe, and right thalamus from a prior event such as ischemia. However, magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography results were normal. An electroencephalogram was also unremarkable. Before immunizations, the patient's ruxolitinib treatment had been on hold for 11 days. No information on patient's family history was provided.  On an unspecified date, the patient received Pediarix vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline), unspecified pneumococcal vaccine, unspecified influenza vaccine, and unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided for all). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date, at the age of 14 months, an unknown period after routine immunization, the patient was admitted to the hospital for fevers and poor oral intake. During this hospitalization, the patient developed blisters and ulceration at the site of the immunizations, which later worsened and became more diffuse. The patient also had worsening digital ischemia leading to autoamputation. Workup for infection included blood culture; urine culture; a respiratory polymerase chain reaction panel that included influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; and serologic testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus. This workup failed to show an infectious cause. During this flare, the patient developed generalized edema, proteinuria, and serum albumin level of 0.8 to 1.9 g/dL, consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis showed protein (3+), and protein-creatinine ratio was 34 mg/mg. Before this hospitalization, he had had multiple urinalyses performed that had never shown proteinuria. The patient also developed high blood pressure, and treatment with 0.25 mg/kg daily of enalapril was started. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg daily, and treatment with ruxolitinib (2.5 mg twice daily) was restarted. He continued to have nephrotic range proteinuria and a kidney biopsy was performed. One core of renal cortex was available for light microscopy; this contained 23 glomeruli, 2 of which were globally sclerotic. Nonsclerotic glomeruli frequently showed collapse of the glomerular tuft associated with prominent epithelial cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Reactive epithelial cells showed numerous cytoplasmic protein droplets. Additionally, focal glomeruli showed areas of segmental glomerulosclerosis. Otherwise, glomeruli showed no evidence of mesangial or endocapillary hypercellularity. Moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were present, involving 30% of the cortical surface. Mild mixed tubulointerstitial inflammation was noted predominantly within areas of scarring. Atrophic tubules showed a thyroidization pattern of atrophy, with focal microcystic tubular dilatation. Nonatrophic tubules showed marked swelling of the tubular epithelium with large numbers of cytoplasmic protein resorption droplets. Arteries and arterioles were unremarkable. Six glomeruli were available for immunofluorescence, none of which were globally sclerotic. All staining, including for immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, fibrinogen, and kappa and lambda light chains, was negative within glomeruli. For IgG and kappa and lambda light chain, the proximal tubule protein resorption droplets stained strongly positive. Ultrastructural examination of a glomerulus using electron microscopy showed uniform glomerular basement membranes of normal thickness. No immune electron-dense deposits were present. Epithelial foot processes were moderately effaced, involving 30% of available capillary loops. Few endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were noted. Tubular basement membranes were unremarkable. Two glomeruli were examined using electron microscopy and both showed a similar degree of epithelial foot-process effacement. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the patient's peripheral blood was genotyped for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles using TaqMan primer/probe custom design assays. One of the G1 risk variants (rs73885319, encoding a serine to glycine substitution at amino acid 342) and the G2 risk variant (the insertion/deletion encoded by rs71785313) showed compound heterozygosity.  This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The outcome of the event was not reported.  The author did not comment relationship between the events and pediarix vaccine, unspecified influenza vaccine, and unspecified Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine.  The authors stated, ""This case of a patient heterozygous for the G1 and G2 risk alleles of APOL1 who has a high interferon (IFN) state due to his underlying condition of SAVI provides further support for IFN as an inducer of collapsing glomerulopathy in individuals with the APOL1 high-risk genotype. As such, patients with type 1 interferonopathies who are affected by the upregulation of type I IFN signaling have persistent systemic inflammation. There is a growing body of evidence implicating IFN pathways in the pathogenesis of APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy. Collapsing glomerulopathy is the most fulminant histopathologic form of APOL1-associated nephropathy. It was reported a case of APOL1-associated nephropathy in the setting of the genetic disease SAVI, a type I interferonopathy syndrome, which raises the possibility of increased risk for kidney disease in patients with this disease. In addition, this case further establishes the pathogenic role of IFN in patients with 2 APOL1 risk alleles. Similar to patients with exogenous IFN therapy, this patient with a condition that leads to increased endogenous IFN levels developed the most fulminant form of APOL1-associated nephropathy, collapsing glomerulopathy.""

As mentioned above, vaccine was reconstituted using normal saline.  I called the Health Dept to see what information I could get before calling the Pt to notify her. Staff with the Health Dept stated that Pt was to be notified and if vaccine was given that day then she was to be revaccinated with the correct components. I did contact GlaxoSmithKline to ask about any additional information that I could pass on to the Pt before calling her. I spoke with RN. RN states that the powder portion of the shingrix is to be reconstituted with the provided activant due to this activating the vaccine and allowing it to ""illicit full immune response,"" states that vaccine mixed with any other diluent ""Cannot guarantee full immunity."" I did ask RN if mixing sterile diluent with shingrix would cause Pt any side effects or reactions and she stated that there has been no reports or research on this other than Pt not having full immunity. RN notes that per the Coalition, recommendation is to have Pt revaccinated. The GlaxoSmithKline number I called is for medical personnel only but I did ask if there was a number that Pt can call if she has any questions or concerns. I did call to advise Pt of vaccine error and try to explain to her with the information stated above but I did not provide Pt with above number  due to speaking with GSK after I spoke with her.

I thought this was unusual of her so I went to check on her early in the morning.  I changed her diaper and noticed she was extremely lethargic and seemed out of it.  She wasn?t interested in nursing or taking a bottle so I called her pediatrician Dr.  I noticed pts legs were stiffening and locking up.  On the way to the doctor?s office she kept her head to the right side in her car seat.  While at the pediatrician?s she stiffened up more into a tonic state.  Dr. told me to rush her to the nearest emergency room because your daughter has either already had a seizure or is having another one.  When Dr. pinched her toes and she had no response to pain.  By the time I got to the emergency room at hospital her eyes where twitching to her right side and seem to be steadily increasing.  Her entire body was stiff as if her joints, tendons, ligaments and muscles were locked up and cramped.  While in the emergency room, the medical staff gave her a shot that brought her out of the seizure but she couldn?t breathe on her own so they had intubate her.  We spent a few days in the icu while the medical staff ran numerous tests on her while closely monitoring her vitals.  After transferring to the neurology department the antibiotic that was given in an IV was switched to oral, we were prescribed oxcarbenzepine to prevent any further seizures and discharged Nov. 3rd 2017.  She couldn?t keep her antibiotic down so we went back to the hospital, readmitted and discharged again Nov 4th 2017. Patient's eyes told me she wasn?t ok, she had a status epileptic seizure that night or early morning and never came out of it completely until treated at the emergency room.  Patient has never had another seizure.  She couldn?t latch to my breast to nurse after the seizure so I had to switch to bottle feeding.  She didn?t have the balance or coordination to sit up and didn?t sit up till around the age of one.  Patient?s eyes drifted bad from the age of 1-2 and was diagnosed with exotropia.  She lacks protective instincts like putting her hands down when falling.  She pulled to stand but very stiff like and falls hard to the floor regardless of the surface.  Patient gets motion sickness or vertigo easily.  Patient?s WILL to achieve milestones is there but her dystonia and ataxia prevent her from walking unassisted, balancing to stand unassisted, feeding herself with utensils ect.  We go to a lot of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy but she is progressing behind the curve with global delay.

IV contrast: None. FINDINGS: The corpus callosum is completely formed. The cerebellar tonsils are normally positioned. The sella is normal in size. T1 shortening of the neurohypophysis is normal in position. There is an age appropriate white matter myelination pattern. There is no restricted diffusion. The cerebral sulci and basal cisterns are well preserved. There is no cerebral edema, mass effect, midline shift or intracranial hemorrhage. Bilateral hippocampi appear small in size with slightly increased T2 signal and mild dilation of the temporal horns. This appears more prominent when compared to the prior exam. No visualized cortical dysplasia, gray matter heterotopia or other migrational anomalies. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. There is no abnormal extra-axial fluid collection. Normal signal voids are maintained within the major intracranial vasculatures, consistent with patency. The mastoid air cells are clear. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The visualized orbits appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis compatible with history of seizures.

They sent it to the radiologist to read it and it was confirmed.   They performed a bronchoscopy in Aug2016 (as reported) and she does not have any specific results. Before this, several times, her heart rate when up past 125.  By then, she had been on so many antibiotics and when she got the bronchoscopy, she was healed. They wanted to do a sputum test.

The bite was deemed high risk and the animal was not found. Given rabies is uniformly fatal, completion of the post exposure protocol was indicated, however additional evaluation was warranted for safety. The reaction is less suggestive of IgE induced urticaria due to the later onset and continued duration, however, due to the extremely pruritic nature of the symptoms indicating allergic response and the symptom onset at the tail of typically accepted window for anaphylaxis response after vaccine, out of an abundance of precaution  the  decision was to defer vaccination and evaluate for allergy via prick testing and to change to Imovax brand.Prick skin testing was  performed to full-strength vaccine. Appropriate positive and negative controls were identified at the appropriate time interval. Results of the skin test were interpreted approximately 15 minutes after placement. After prick skin testing was determined to be negative, the patient underwent further evaluation with a 1:100 dilution of the Imovax brand rabies vaccine intradermal with appropriate controls.

The patient also started having fever with associated chills, dizziness and generalized weakness. She also had complained of some nausea. She had been unable to move her left shoulder and noted some area of redness on the left upper arm. The patient called the EMS and was brought to ER and was found to be hypotensive and febrile. T-max is at 102.9. Admission white cell count was elevated at 16 and is now down to 11.4. The patient has multiple antibiotic allergies and was started on Rocephin and Zithromax and on some ibuprofen and states that she is now feeling about 50% improved. The patient was wanting to be transferred to another hospital, however, there is no bed available. Nares screen for MRSA has come back negative. Creatinine is at 0.58. Procalcitonin is at 0.22. Troponins were negative. CT angiogram of the chest did not reveal any underlying pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection. An MRI of the left arm and shoulder has been ordered and remains pending. The patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. She denies any vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The patient could have another severe drug reaction similar to what happened to her in 2008 when she was admitted to Hospital for infected left TKA. She hadanaphylactic shock and generalized pustular rash due to daptomycin. 10/01/2019 Patient received a Pneumovax 23 vaccine on September 23. As the day progressed, she developed severe pain and swelling in her left arm at the injection site extending up to her left shoulder. She also had fever and chills, dizziness and weakness with a MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE of 102.9. She was brought to the emergency room when she was found to be hypotensive as well as febrile. She was treated for cellulitis with azithromycin, Rocephin, and clindamycin given her multiple antibiotic allergies. MRI of the shoulder revealed diffuse myofascial edema and mild Intramuscular edema within the deltoid consistent with nonspecific myositis and fasciitis. Her clinical presentation was therefore felt to be more consistent with an adverse reaction to the vaccine. She was given Solu-Medrol and started on a prednisone taper. She is currently on 40 mg of prednisone daily for 3 days, and will decrease by 10 mg every 3 days, finishing with 5 mg daily for 4 days. She also was given prescriptions for Cefdinir 300 mg b.i.d. for an additional 7 days and clindamycin 300 mg every 6 hours for an additional 7 days. Erythema has essentially resolved. She does note that her tongue is sore now.

The patient was the part of the phase IV double-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial from June 2017 through June 2018 at the community research clinic maintained by the International Centre, that aimed to compare vaccine take (primary outcome) among healthy infants randomized to receive either the standard dose or double the standard dose of oral Rotarix vaccine at 6 and 10 weeks of life. Also aimed to evaluate the effect of increased Rotarix inoculum on vaccine take among infants. They hypothesized that an increased vaccine inoculum would lead to improved vaccine take in this population. The study was registered at web site. [In this study, Healthy infants were enrolled within the first week of life. All the enrolled infants does not have any congenital malformations, birth (weight) or enrollment weight was more than the 2000 gm, does not had any immunocompromising condition infants. Infants were randomized using random permuted blocks. Randomization by unique study identification number (SID) was pre-determined 1:1 to the high-dose or standard-dose arm using random permuted blocks (block sizes 4 and 8). The 220 infants were enrolled and randomized (110 per group). By the 220, whom 189 completed the study per-protocol: 97 standard-dose and 92 high-dose infants completed the study per-protocol. The first infant was enrolled on 12th June 2017. Upon achieving targeting enrollment, the final infant was enrolled 25th February 2018 and completed the study on 7th June 2018]. The patient belongs to the high dose arm. No information on patient's medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant condition was provided. On unspecified date between 12th June 2017 to 7th June 2018, at the age of 6 week, the patient received 1st dose of oral rotarix vaccine and at the age of 10 week, the patient received 2nd oral rotarix vaccine (dosage unknown; batch number not provided) and 1 week following the rotarix vaccination and at the age of 11 week, the patient had received oral unspecified polio vaccine (OPV) as per the Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI) schedule. [In this study, Rotarix (RV) was a monovalent oral vaccine consisting of an live-attenuated, G1P strain of human rotavirus. It was pre-qualified by WHO in 2009 and was currently the most widely used RV vaccine in national immunization program. Rotarix was administered on a 2 doses schedule at 6 and 10 weeks of life on the WHO-recommended Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI) schedule. Infants in the high-dose arm received 2 doses of Rotarix, each consisting of 1.5 mL of clear liquid, at 6 and 10 weeks of life. Infants in the standard-dose arm received 1st dose of Rotarix (1.5 mL) and one equivalent volume of a sterile, pharmacy grade water at 6 and 10 weeks of life. The lot numbers of vaccines used in this study were AROLB475AI, AROLB580AB, AROLB834BF, AROLB855AA, AROLB832BH, AROLB910AE, AROLB884AF, and AROLB955BJ. To separate oral polio vaccine (OPV) from Rotarix administration, all children in the study received standard EPI vaccines (including OPV) one week following each Rotarix dose at the nearest EPI clinic. EPI vaccine history was recorded by the study team from each infant's immunization card. Infants were included in the per-protocol population if both vaccine doses were administered within the pre-specified window period for vaccination (week 6 + 7 days for dose 1 and 28-35 days later for dose 2), at least 1 mL of blood was successfully collected at both week 6 and week 14, the first two stool specimens following each vaccine dose were collected within the pre-specified window periods (3-4 days and 6-7 days post-vaccination), and the first dose of OPV was received no earlier than the day of surveillance stool collection at 6-7 days post-1st-dose]. On unspecified date between 12th June 2017 to 7th June 2018, 4 weeks after the 2nd dose of Rotarix, 3 weeks after OPV, the patient had an symptoms of diarrheal episodes. The patient's stool sample and plasma specimen has been taken for the RV-IgA measurement by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The stool specimens were tested for RV by qRT-PCRa and positive specimens subsequently underwent conventional RT-PCR to amplify the RV VP8 gene segment followed by Sanger sequencing using VP4F and/or VP4R primers and BLAST analysis to confirm Rotarix vaccine-strain virus. The patient was found the positive for the wild-type strains and has been diagnosed with the two separate wild type asymptomatic infections (P [4] and P [6]), that was detected in three sequential stool specimens. [In this study, Vaccine take was defined as detection of post-vaccination fecal vaccine shedding by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with sequence confirmation or plasma rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A (RV-IgA) seroconversion 4 weeks following the 2nd dose. The vaccine take occurred in 62 high-dose infants versus 69 standard-dose infants. The plasma was collected from all infants pre-vaccination at 6 weeks and again 4 weeks post-dose 2 at 14 weeks for RV-IgA measurement by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Seropositive was defined as RV-IgA equal or more than 20 U/mL. Seroconversion was defined as seronegative at week 6 pre-vaccination, converting to seropositive post-vaccination at week 14. Infants who were seropositive at week 6 were therefore considered negative for seroconversion analyses but included in analyses for post-vaccination seropositivity. RV-IgA EIA was performed in the research laboratory of the principal investigator. The stool specimens were collected by home visit within 3 days prior to each vaccine dose and 3-4 days, 6-7 days, and 13-14 days after 1st dose and 3-4 days, 6-7 days, and 13-16 days after 2nd dose 2. All stool specimens underwent total nucleic acid extraction with spiking of MS2 phage as RNA extraction. All extracts were tested for RV by qRT-PCR targeting the RV NSP3 gene segment. Amplification was performed on the CFX96 platform by using Ultraplex 1-step ToughMix. ST3-strain NSP3 was cloned into pFastBac1 and serial dilutions of known copy number. Positive specimens subsequently underwent conventional RT-PCR to amplify the RV VP8 gene segment followed by Sanger sequencing using VP4F and/or VP4R primers and BLAST analysis to confirm Rotarix vaccine-strain virus. Fecal vaccine shedding was defined as detection of vaccine strain virus in any scheduled post-vaccination stool specimen by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) followed by vaccine strain sequence confirmation. PCR-positive surveillance stool specimens were also tested for RV antigen using the ProSpecT RV microplate EIA. Stool extraction, qRT-PCR, and stool EIA was performed. Positive specimens were transferred for RT-PCR in the laboratory of the principal investigator followed by Sanger sequencing by the core facility. Active diarrheal surveillance was initiated upon enrollment until study completion at 14 weeks of life. A diarrheal episode was defined as three or more abnormally loose stools (as determined by caregivers) within a 24-hour period. Specimens for each diarrheal episode were collected by home visit and tested for RV using both antigen and PCR detection. 41 infants in the standard-dose arm seroconverted following vaccination, compared to 42 infants in the high-dose Arm. Similar results were observed when the frequency of infants who were seropositive post-vaccination at week 14 (irrespective of baseline RV-IgA) was compared between groups: 42 infants in the standard-dose arm were seropositive post-vaccination compared to 46 infants in the high-dose arm. The overall frequency of fecal vaccine shedding by PCR detection was (N = 118). The kinetics of RV shedding, relative to each dose of Rotarix, by Using PCR detection, 63 infants in the standard-dose arm demonstrated fecal shedding of Rotarix vaccine in any stool specimen at any time point following vaccination, compared to 55 infants in the high-dose arm. After conducting the post-hoc analysis among participants with confirmed vaccine replication, following the first dose, 36 infants in the standard-dose arm had confirmed vaccine replication, compared to 29 infants in the high-dose arm. Following the second dose, 14 infants in the standard-dose arm had confirmed vaccine replication, compared to 17 infants. All PCR-positive specimens underwent stool RV antigen test by EIA. The limit of detection of typical stool RV antigen EIA was approximately 106 particles/mL, whereas the standard dose of Rotarix contains a 106.5 cell culture infective dose (CCID50) of virus, which corresponds to 106 fluorescent focus units (FFU). Detection by EIA only occurs following replication, which achieves stool viral concentrations equivalent to or in excess of the initial inoculum. The 33 patients had Rotarix sequence-confirmed specimens that were also EIA-positive: 19 in the standard-dose arm, compared to 14 in the high-dose arm. Among all PCR-positive stool specimens, 22 were positive for wild-type strains: 2 untypeable, 3 P [4], 3 P[6], and 14 P [8]. Nineteen infants (9 standard-dose, 10 high-dose) had wild-type asymptomatic infections, 10 of whom also shed Rotarix at other time points. One infant had two separate asymptomatic infections (P [4] and P [6]), and another had a single episode of asymptomatic P [4] infection that was detected in three sequential stool specimens. Among the nine who did not shed Rotarix, seven seroconverted, (three standard-dose, four high-dose), meaning seroconversion waslikelydueto natural infection and not vaccination.]. This case was considered of vaccination failure. This case has been considered as serious due to vaccination failure. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not provided. [In this study, the pre-specified primary outcome was vaccine take, defined as either RV-IgA seroconversion or detection of sequence-confirmed fecal vaccine shedding in any post-vaccination surveillance stool specimen, as described. The pre-specified secondary outcomes were RV-IgA seroconversion alone and fecal vaccine shedding alone. Additional post-hoc assessments were performed to assess RV-IgA seropositivity and three- and four-fold rise in antibody concentration following vaccination, frequency of fecal shedding specimens positive by stool RV antigen EIA, vaccine take using EIA-positive fecal shedding specimens, and to identify infants with confirmed replication of vaccine-strain virus. For vaccine replication analysis, they identified all infants with sequence-confirmed Rotarix shedding, but who demonstrated increasing stool viral burden (as evidenced by lower Cq values) in sequential stool specimens following either vaccine dose (i.e. lower Cq at day 6-7 or 2 weeks compared to Cq at day 3-4 or day 6-7]. The author commented, ""Thus, it was unclear if an increased inoculum of vaccine could improve vaccine response, as assessed by vaccine ��take"" (a composite measure of either post-vaccination antibody seroconversion or fecal vaccine shedding) in children in low-income countries. We did detect modestly elevated RV-IgA GMC in the high-dose group (116.3 U/mL vs 89.0 U/mL among seropositive infants). Overall, our results are consistent with the finding that oral vaccine immunogenicity, both in terms of frequency of RV-IgA seroconversion and of achievable antibody concentrations, are substantially lower in low-income countries. In contrast, we did observe in post-hoc analysis that children with vaccine replication or EIA-positive shedding had significantly higher RV-IgA responses, with RV-IgA GMC of 56.3 U/mL among children with confirmed vaccine replication vs 13.4 U/mL in those without, and GMC of 63.0 U/mL in those with EIA-detectable fecal shedding vs 21.7 U/mL in those without. The association between increased immunogenicity with vaccine replication. We defined vaccine replication via detection of increasing stool virus burden over time, which could only be achieved by viral replication. Using PCR detection allowed us to identify children with low-level replication that may have been below the limit of detection of stool EIA. Our results further confirm that the poor response to oral vaccines in low-income settings is strongly influenced by inability to successfully establish replicating gut infection, possibly due to impaired gut health and function. Since the current study used Rotarix, our results may not be generalizable to other vaccines. And finally, since RV-IgA is a suboptimal correlate of risk and vaccine efficacy in low-income countries, it is conceivable that increased inoculum could have had an effect on clinical protection that could not be captured within the scope of this study. However, we confirmed the role of vaccine-strain virus replication in enhanced immunogenicity, underscoring the importance of underlying gut health in responses to vaccine."" The author concluded, ""Administration of double the standard dose of an oral, live-attenuated rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) did not improve vaccine take among infants in specific urban area. However, improved immunogenicity in children with vaccine replication irrespective of initial inoculum provides further evidence for the need to promote in-host replication and improved gut health to improve oral vaccine response in low-income settings"".

The nurse stood next to me to prepare me for the shot, then administered the shot while still standing.  The nurse chose a location on my left arm near my shoulder, high up on the arm in the area of the deltoid muscle.  Not in the tricep muscle.  The area of the shot was swollen and hurt (pain level 4-5) for approximately 2 days, accompanied by general malaise-like symptoms.  The malaise symptoms dissipated in  approximately 4-5 days.  However, even though the shoulder pain reduced, the pain persists to this day at a level of 3-4, sometimes more when trying to raise the left arm above the shoulder level. (Next) The left shoulder pain occurs now any time I try to raise my left arm above the shoulder level by extending the arm out and away from the body.  If I bend my left arm at the elbow first, then push the left arm up above my shoulder height, there is no pain.  If the left arm hangs down next to my body there is no pain.  However, significant pain occurs when I have to pull a shirt over my head to dress and undress, when applying deodorant to the left arm, if I lean on my left elbow, of if I push with my left arm as when standing up from a chair or doing a push-up exercise.  I normally exercise in a gymnasium every other day using weights, weight resistance machines, and aerobic machines.  Now I have to use reduced weight levels due to the pain when doing some exercises.  For instance, before the shot I would use 30 pound weights for curls to exercise the biceps.  If I use 30 pounds now for curls, there is a sharp burning pain in my left bicep.  I have to go down to 20 pounds to do curls for the left arm.  Similarly, I had to reduce the weight levels significantly for bench-press type exercises and limit the movement of the weights to just a few inches from fully extended arms.  If I bend my arms completely during a bench-press type exercise, I have significant pain trying to re-extend the left arm.",,,,,,,,,N,09/16/2019,09/16/2019,0,,PVT,,"Glucosamine, Vitamin D3",None,NOne,,,2,10/25/2019,,Y,,None

The following is verbatim from the a abstract:  The pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis entails complex interactions between triggering factors, autoantigens, genetic predisposition, and immunoregulatory networks. Implicated triggering factors are numerous and include toxins, medications, and infectious agents. In this article, we present a unique case of a 31-year-old woman with severe autoimmune hepatitis apparently abruptly triggered by vaccination. All evidence suggests this was an idiosyncratic response to either hepatitis A or yellow fever vaccination.   This case involves a 31 years old female patient who experienced autoimmune hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis) and idiosyncratic response (idiosyncratic drug reaction), while she received vaccines HEPATITIS A VACCINE and YELLOW FEVER VACCINE.  The patient's past medical history, medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect HEPATITIS A VACCINE and YELLOW FEVER VACCINE produced produced by unknown manufacturer (lot number and Expiry date unknown) via unknown route in unknown administration site.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a serious autoimmune hepatitis (Unknown latency) following the administration of YELLOW FEVER VACCINE and HEPATITIS A VACCINE. This event was assessed as medically significant.  On an unknown date, the patient developed a idiosyncratic response (idiosyncratic drug reaction) (Unknown latency) following the administration of YELLOW FEVER VACCINE and of HEPATITIS A VACCINE.  (Other relevant tests included no lab data.)  Final diagnosis was idiosyncratic response and autoimmune hepatitis.   It was not reported if the patient received a corrective treatment.  The event outcome is reported as Unknown for autoimmune hepatitis and idiosyncratic response.  Information on the batch number was requested.; Sender's Comments: This case involves a 31 years old female patient who experienced autoimmune hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis) and idiosyncratic response (idiosyncratic drug reaction), while she received vaccines HEPATITIS A VACCINE and YELLOW FEVER VACCINE. Time to onset is unknown with the role of vaccine. However, further information including concomitant medications and lab tests excluding other etiology would be needed to fully assess this case.

In the six months since my injection, the pain in my upper arm has not gone away. I am now limited in my movement with my left arm.  If I move my arm in certain ways or hold too much weight, I have extreme pain (even if I move slowly and don't continue when I begin to feel the pain starting,  it is like the muscle continues to ""twist"" in my upper arm and then slowly returns to no pain).
