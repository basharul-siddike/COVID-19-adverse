Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a 80-year-old male patient who was vaccinated with unspecified Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to case 1 of table 1 reported in this literature article. The patient had medical history significant for end-stage renal disease ESRD; diabetes mellitus; lymphoma (status post chemotherapy in 2009); coronary artery disease. On unspecified date in 2008, the patient had an initiated of hemodialysis. At the time of initiation, the patient was considered HBV- susceptible (anti-HBs and HBsAg negative) but failed to respond to a full HBV vaccination series. In 2009, HBV testing confirmed he was HBV susceptible. No information on patient's family history or concomitant condition was provided. On unspecified date in 2010, the patient had received unspecified Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On unspecified date, unknown period after vaccination and in between during this period July 2011 and January 2014, the patient was on hemodialysis (HD), the patient was on likely infectious and not on HBV isolation.  On unspecified date in between 2011 and 2014, the patient potential exposure period was elsewhere (i.e travel history). The patient had an HBV serology, which showed that First known negative HBsAg (July 2010); Last known negative HBsAg (July 2012); First known positive HBsAg (January 2014); First known negative anti- HBs (December 2010); Last known negative anti- HBs (July 2011); First known positive anti- HBs (before HBsAg seroconversion) January 2012 (negative in January 2014); First known positive total anti-HBc ( February 2014 (tested negative June 2010). In January 2012, the case patient was anti-HBs positive and HBsAg negative and considered HBV immune.  On unspecified date in 2013, the patient had hospitalization due to multiple invasive procedures including HD, surgery. On an unspecified date in January 2014, the patient had an HBV Isolation precautions were implemented. Further HBV testing revealed that he had chronic HBV infection (negative immunoglobulin M [IgM], anti-HBc, positive total anti-HBc (February 2014 (tested negative June 2010), positive hepatitis B e antigen, First known positive HBsAg (January 2014). On an unspecified February 2014, the patient's HBV serology showed that the patient had a high HBV DNA levels of 593,045,000 copies/mL [UltraQuant] on and on unspecified date in 2014, the patient had an 101,898,000 IU/mL [AmpliPrep/cobas-Roche]. On an unspecified May 2013, the patient's highest known ALT/AST: 19/54. The patient had also done HBsAg testing by platform such in January 2014: positive; Siemens Advia Centaur XP: not tested; VITROS in March 2014: positive. Given the unusual serologic picture of HBsAg seroconversion several months after the initial laboratory evidence of exposure to HBV infection (newly anti-HBs positive in January 2012) paired with high HBV DNA levels, infection with an HBV mutant strain was suspected. Sequencing of HBV DNA revealed a genotype H infection with a sP127L mutation in the ""a"" determinant region. The patient also had other HBV testing's which showed that the sequencing of HBV DNA revealed a genotype H infection with a sp127l mutation in the ""a"" determinant region. The screening of potentially exposed hemodialysis patient in 2014 did not reveal new HBV infections. The source of HBV infection was not discovered.  The case patient died in 2014 from complications of ESRD and non-alcoholic related cirrhosis. It was unknown whether his death was related to HBV infection.  This case considered as suspected vaccination failure due to onset of time was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure. The author commented, ""It was unknown whether his death was related to HBV infection. To our knowledge, there has been no documented hemodialysis-related transmission of a mutant strain of HBV."" The author concluded ""Mutant HBV infections should be suspected in patients who test HBsAg negative and concurrently test positive for HBV DNA at high levels. Dialysis providers should consider using HBsAg assays that can also detect mutant HBV strains for routine HBV testing."" This is 1 of the 2 valid cases reported in this literature article.

The subject's father was 30-year-old.  The subject's mother had three previous pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions. The subject's mother had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCMs). The subject's mother had no history of offspring with MCM. The subject's mother did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The mother's current condition include obesity with BMI 30+ and hypertension. The mother's historical vaccine included TDap (diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular and tetanus vaccine toxoid) as vaccine. The mother's concomitant medications included Baby Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and labetalol, both used for hypertension and prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) for obstetrical (OB) care.   The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was on an unspecified date in 2019. Estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) were reported as 25-Nov-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 22-May-2019, the subject's mother underwent first trimester screen and it was noted that the foetus was positive for Down Syndrome. However, later the mother underwent MaterniT 21 and it was within normal limits. No MCMs noted.  On 29-May-2019, the subject's mother underwent MaterniT 21 and no MCMs were noted.  On 09-Oct-2019, at approximately 33 weeks of gestation, the subject's mother was administered Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD (Flucelvax QIVc) [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent; batch number: 261207, dose: 0.5 mL, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as �Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation.   On an unspecified date, pregnancy status of subject's mother was collected and non-reassuring fetal heart tones (FHT), failure to progress (FTP) and fetus intrauterine growth restrictions (IUGR) were reported as pregnancy complications.   On 06-Nov-2019, at approximately 37.3 weeks of gestation, the mother delivered a live male neonate via caesarean method. The neonate's birth weight was 2013 grams, body length and head circumference were not reported. The reported appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at one minute was 8, at five minutes was 9 and no data was provided at 10 minutes. MCM identified at birth was hypospadias. As reported, contributing factor to neonate's hypospadias was hypertension in mother. Etiology was unknown, however, it was reported that it was possibly genetic as possible anti-androgenic exposures. It was reported that gestational age for origin of the defect was 7 to 12 weeks and that the origin of the defect was prior the mother's vaccination. Other factors contributing to the MCM were unknown.  At the time of initial reporting, the outcome of the events of low birth weight baby, hypospadias, non-reassuring fetal heart tones and fetus intrauterine growth restrictions and failure to progress was not reported.  The events of 'low birth weight baby', 'hypospadias', 'non-reassuring fetal heart tones' and 'fetus intrauterine growth restrictions and failure to progress' were assessed as serious (medically significant).   The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Flucelvax QIVc.  This case is linked to case number 201906264 (corresponding mother case).  Company Comment: The male neonatal subject was delivered as low birth weight baby with nonreassuring foetal heart rate pattern, foetal growth restriction and hypospadias after foetal exposure during pregnancy (at approximately 33 weeks of gestation) with the suspect product, Flucelvax QIV. Chronology is plausible for all events except for hypospadias. Gestational age for origin of hypospadias was 7 to 12 weeks, making temporal relationship incompatible. Mother's medical history of three spontaneous abortions, hypertension and obesity (body mass index 31.9) may provide alternative aetiology for the events. Causality was also confounded with concomitant medications, Baby Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and labetalol. Foetal exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not related per company's conventions. For the events low birth weight baby nonreassuring foetal heart rate pattern and foetal growth restriction, causal role of the suspect product cannot be totally excluded and is assessed as unlikely related.

The initial side effects were the ones documented as common; muscle and joint pain, fever, headache, tired, loss of appetite, swollen glands in neck (flue like symptoms).  These started early afternoon on the 30th.  The fever subsided around 2 am on Dec 1st.   I then started to experience a side effect I did not see identified for this vaccine.  I noticed on Dec 1st that my urine was darker in color than normal.  It was more yellow / brown in color.  At first, I did not pay much attention as I figured that because the vaccine caused me to lose my appetite I had not been eating or drinking as much.  I figured my urine was just more concentrated due to drinking less water although it did have a slightly brown tinge rather than just a darker yellow that is more characteristic for me when I start to get dehydrated.   The next morning, December 2nd my urine was a very dark (slightly reddish) brown color.  (It may have been this color during the night but I did not check when emptied my bladder at night as only have a night light in the bathroom at night so don?t turn on a room light.)  I did not feel like I was dehydrated or thirsty.  I was still drinking some water because that is what I normally do but not as much as I was not thirsty.  I did not feel the urge to urinate as frequently that day.  When I urinated late afternoon, my urine was still a very dark (slightly reddish) brown color.  After urinating the water in the bowel looked like the color after having diarrhea (but of course no solid matter in this case).  At that point I started drinking much more water regardless of thirst.   I am continuing to monitor the situation and if it has not cleared up by the end of the day on December 3rd, I will go to see a doctor on December 4th.  It is my assumption that I have blood in my urine (but it is not fresh red) or perhaps bilirubin.  Unfortunately, I did not think to get a urine sample for testing (I don?t have a sterile container to collect it in).  I have not experienced pain or discomfort when urinating.  I have no health problems and am not on any medications.  So far on December 3rd my urine color has not been the very dark brown.  It has lightened to more of a dark yellow brown.

This case corresponds to figure 2 reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of a descriptive study that was conducted to characterized public posts about the HPV vaccine and quantify the impact of sentiment and context on engagement via likes. By using analytic method at the beginning 30th April, 2018, through 20th August, 2018, publicly available posts (n = 29,763 posts) were collected although the final sample included posts that were created as far back as November 2, 2011, because API did not have a retrospective time limit on data collection. For the study inclusion criteria included, unique (not duplicates post, languages post, working link URL, text mentions HPV, specific to the HPV vaccine. Out of total 29,763, of 3, 378 posts were eligible. Our final analytic sample include 360 posts (as coded non-purposive post]. No information on patient's medical history or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided.

The patient's parent notified to the doctor office they ran out and started examination of the patient. The examination revealed the patient's heart rate dropped to 52 beats per minute and the patient was in distress. The patient was taken to hospital by ambulance and was hooked into an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood work (result not provided for both). It was reported that the pedestrian said that it was a vaccine reaction, however hospital was saying that the patient had vagal reaction and discrediting vaccine reaction. This case was posted by friend of patient's parent on social media. This case has been considered as serious due to Hospitalization. Treatment was unknown.  The outcome of the event was not reported. The author commented, ""The final analytic sample comprised 360 unique posts from 292 users. Of the 1,200 randomly sampled posts, 979 (81.6%) had active links, and one in three (n = 360 out of 979; 36.8% posts with working links) was relevant to the HPV vaccine. The author concluded, ""On social media, discussions about HPV vaccination are often characterized by emotionally charged expressions of personal beliefs, personal narratives, information, and misinformation. Pro-vaccine posts are more prevalent on social media and anti-vaccine posts have higher engagement. We found that personal narratives about HPV vaccination were more likely to promote anti-vaccine sentiment and were produced more often by individual users who were not health-related or health professionals. At the same time, we observed that posts from health-related sources were predominantly in favor of the HPV vaccine, but posted pro-vaccine personal narratives far less often than information or resources. Provaccine narratives tended to show individuals who had recently received the vaccine, but rarely provided long-term details about their experience with vaccination, such as recognition or appreciation of an individual's personal role in life-long cancer prevention, highlighting stark contrasts with the depth and scope of details included in anti-vaccine personal narrative posts. Within the context of HPV vaccination, our research contributes meaningfully to gaps in the study of misinformation on social media by offering an estimate for the prevalence of misinformation on social media, as quantified by the proportion of anti-vaccine posts, and we also identified important characteristics of misinformation-containing anti-vaccine posts. More broadly, by equipping Provaccine advocates with concrete recommendations to improve the engagement, via likes, of their social media content, our findings may apply to combatting vaccine hesitancy in general, an emerging and global health threat identified recently by the World Health Organization.  With sufficient resources, organizations such as patient advocacy groups, health departments, and government agencies could create a portfolio of positive pro-vaccine narratives with accompanying visuals (e.g., photo) to disseminate, filling an essentially unoccupied field of content"".

Buckling seat belt motion is painful. I'm concerned something isn't right. The injection felt ""bubbly"" toward the end.""  The shot didn't feel right. The Pharmacist did not pinch the muscle and the shot felt high in the arm. At the end of the injection before he removed the needle I felt a ""burst, or bubbling"" sensation in my shoulder joint immediately followed by the pain that I still have today. I've had several flu shots in the past and I'm familiar with the soreness that comes on after the shot and lingers for about a day. I had that pain as well, but it came and went like it usually does.  I always bleed after an injection and there was no blood this time.  Wife commented about how high the bandaid was on my shoulder. Do not remember seeing a bruise.  Today, December 6th, 2019, I am still experiencing pain. Pain lifting or lowering the weight of a milk jug or more past horizontal. Pushing down to lift my weight. Cross body motions like coats or robes. Sometimes feels like the arm is weaker, like I cannot lift my coat to swing it on.   The pain feels sharp, comes on quick and goes away quick.

Here is the sequences of incidents:   Wednesday 10-23-2019 : We went to Clinic for vaccinations and regular check-ups. Dr. is primary pediatrician for my son. After the checkup, she told us that baby is good in growth. Vaccination done on 10-23-2019 at 11.30 AM EST. Attached vaccination card in this email. Please check.  On the same day around 3 pm, kid was sleeping and suddenly we heard some grunting sounds.  We checked baby and observed that baby eyes were rolling and unconscious and unable to breathe.  We tried to wake him up but he didn't wake up. Immediately, we understand the seriousness and called 911. Ambulance came in less than five minutes and they pump the air for breathing problem and they took the baby to hospital. They helped him breathing, given IV fluids, removed urine using catheter, and some first-aid process. Also taken chest x-ray and CT SCAN.  They said that X-ray and CT-scan were good. Baby opened eyes, crying a lot and my wife feed him ( breast feeding). On the same day around 7 PM, Pediatrician sent the baby to  hospital for observation.  Baby reached Hospital around 8 PM.   Sr.physician Told me that it may be Hypoxia/seizures due to low level Oxygen in blood and baby is in life & death situation.   At this time, the baby is almost normal, opening eyes and recognizing us and crying for pain ( May be pain in hand - intravenous  drip) They Started Brain ECG  and started giving treatment for seizures. Baby was not sleeping and crying the complete night.  (They started giving medicine for stopping seizures, antibiotics, sodium carbonate, liquids and IV fluids.)  Thursday 10-24-2019: My son was crying throughout night. He got a fever 102c and in mid night around 2.30 AM and 5.30 AM, he just moved his legs, hands, and head. Doctors said that this may be seizures as they are rhythmic movement. They took him to MRI scan and spinal tap( extract liquid from spinal) test. They said that MRI and spinal tap test looks good. Evening, Baby got the flu and fever went up to 104. Baby eyes were swollen and can't open.  Baby was crying through out night.

Next he added Dorzolamide HCL 2%eye drops. After today's I wanted to stay in bed.  I told him I couldn't take them. I still have all pills left for proof of number taken. I had my laser treatment (108 zaps in left eye) on August 29th/19 Tol to tay on Combigan but I noticed in less than a week I began it itch all over. Seemed to progress and in three nights I reported this and they suggested I not take them or 4 days. It seemed to halt further progression, but still became more and more prolific.  I called the doctor and He said He never heard of this and I had a skin decease.   I have gon to the Dermatologist who prescribed Fluocinolone 0.01% (11/4/19) in Cera ve cream.

The pharmacist helpfully instructed me to gently move arm to avoid stiffening. Also I took some Advil before the shot, and that helped, too. The movement and the Advil  helped, and everyone taking this vaccine should be instructed to do so.  The more alarming symptoms were a kind of labored breathing. It's true I have some emphysema and continue to smoke! but this was different. I did feel increased weakness. I have had dizziness sporadically for a year, maybe two  years, and I'm not sure if this vaccine increased or exacerbated that. I felt some general chest  pressure as well as some panic, both of which I sometimes do anyway, and again, I feel the vaccine may have worsened these. I felt a little bit of sweating & chills. My heart beat is usually pretty slow (49, 62 - it varies) but these first several hours after the vaccine it was up to about 72 bpm and not worrisome to me. After about 6 hours or so these symptoms lessened, and I calmed down more as well. I want to mention them because some of my symptoms were on the ""Call 911 if this happens"" list and I didn't quite know what to do.

0851633,12/09/2019,CA,48.0,48,,F,,"My arm hurt immediately after getting the flu shot. But I didn't think anything right away as this is typical. The next day it was still bad and didn't go away. It hurt near the shoulder, a sharp pain when I would move  my arm in most directions. Simple things like releasing the parking brake in the car by my knee, pulling a blanket over me in bed. Lifting light things. Opening a door. Everything. I rested it a few days to little but not much improvement. Then things around it started hurting because I wasn't using it and had it glued to my side. My back started freezing up. I was able to treat my back and the things around it with 2 visits to massage therapist specializing in fixing problems. But the shoulder never improved. Still sharp pain from most day to day arm activities with no improvemnt and increasing worry. I finally started in physical therapy after 5 weeks (10/25/19)and I started improving immediately from the strengthening and movement exercises he gave me. These were exercises for shoulder impingement. Bursitis may also describe what I have. I have made consistent progress but it has been a long process. It has been 6 weeks of twice daily physical therapy exercises and icing at home (with 3 PT visits to monitor and increase exercises 10/25, 11/7, 11/22) and now I am able to use my arm more. I still get twinges from most movements and pain (much less than before) from various movements and still have only limited weight-bearing capacity but I continue to do the exercises and go to PT.  Both the doctor and physical therapist asked extensively about other possible causes when I indicated it was due to a flu shot. I said there was no hurt or trauma event and then I've had zero history of shoulder issues and it happens immediately following the flu shot It seems to fit SIRVA shoulder injury related to vaccine administration.

Clinically I appreciated the changes when he came in for a flu vaccine in October 2019.   Initially I did not believe the changes were related to vaccines.  In November, when I saw patient for his 12-month Well Check, I began considering the possibility of atrophy of the subcutaneous fatty tissue.  I referred him to pediatric dermatology for further evaluation.   Diagnosis from Dr. (pediatric dermatologist) is not certain, possibilities include lipoatrophy secondary to immunization.  Presumably since mother reports noticing these changes by 10 months old, the most recent injection on the affected thigh would be the Pediarix dose given on May 8, 2019.  Dr. states she has seen this adverse reaction from steroid injections, but never seen it secondary to immunizations.

The mother's current conditions included body mass index 40 and higher (reported as severely obese), stress and smoking.  The mother's concomitant medication was not provided.  The subject's mother obstetrical history noted that the she had two previous pregnancies, both with full-term live birth. The subject's mother did not have a history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The mother's family history of major congenital malformation was collected, and the father of baby's maternal nephew had cystic fibrosis. The subject's mother did not use alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The mother was a user of tobacco. Subject's paternal age was 32.  The subject's mother last menstrual period (LMP) date was 15-Mar-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The mother's estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 20-Dec-2019 and corrected EDD was reported as 19-Nov-2019. It was reported that the subject's mother had late entry in prenatal care.   On 02-Jul-2019, the mother underwent anatomy scan and there was no MCM noted.  On 28-Aug-2019 the subject's mother received Tdap [diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular, tetanus vaccine toxoid, dose 0.5 mL, route of administration intramuscular] for unknown indication.  On 12-Sep-2019, at gestation age of 25 weeks, the subject's mother was administered Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD [influenza vaccine, batch number: 2612000, dose: 0.5 mL, route of administration, anatomical location, and expiry date: not reported] (explicitly coded as �Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for unknown indication.   at gestational age of 40 weeks, the subject's mother vaginally delivered live birth, male neonate with birth weight: 3714 grams. The gestational age at outcome was 40 weeks, body length, head circumference and the appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) were not reported. There was MCM identified at birth as transposition of great vessels.  Other factors contributing to the MCM were unknown. Gestational age range for origin of the defect was three to eight weeks. Ethology of defect was reported as abnormal or absent migration of cardiac neural crest. There had been associations with maternal obesity, smoking and stress. Genetic associations also had been described. As reported, a temporal assessment was that exposure was after the origin of the defect. There was no data about scientific advisory committee (SAC) temporal assessment.  The subject was sent to another medical facility for heart defect. The subject was admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to respiratory distress.   At the time of initial report, the outcome of respiratory distress and transposition of great vessels was not reported.  The event of transposition of great vessels was considered as serious due to criterion of congenital anomaly and medical significance and respiratory distress was considered as serious due to medical significance.  The investigator assessed the transposition of great vessels as not related to Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD, while causality of respiratory distress was not reported.

On 14-OCT-2014, the patient was vaccinated with zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) (strength, dose, route, lot# and expiration date unknown) for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). After receiving defendants' zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) vaccine, on 18-OCT-2014, the patient was diagnosed with shingles after experiencing extreme pain, a rash and an outbreak of blisters on her back, spine, breast and ribcage resulting in medical treatment. This outbreak lasted for months and resulted in post-herpetic neuralgia. Zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) caused these injuries and the need for medical treatment. As a direct and proximate result of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient's symptoms had resulted in physical limitations not presented prior to using the vaccine. The patient also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of her condition and had suffered economic losses due to her inability to work.

The patient's pertinent medical history included a bypass surgery. His concurrent conditions included coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.   On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent)(manufacturer unknown) and with influenza virus vaccine (unspecified) both for prophylaxis (strength, dose, dose number, route of administration, lot number and expiration date were not reported).   On an unspecified date, five days after vaccination, the patient presented with flu-like symptoms and cyanosis of the toes and fingers. He also had nonpalpable, purpuric lesions on his toes and fingers along with acral pain. It was also reported that he progressively had worsening purpura and digital ischemia along with livedo reticularis of both plantar surfaces. Within four weeks, the patient presented anorexia, night sweats, myalgias, fatigue and arthralgias. A biopsy was offered but the patient refused to do it.   On an unspecified date, the patient had laboratory evaluation with normal findings of complete blood count, urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panel, he also had antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, immunofixation eletrophoresis, hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody tests and all of them with negative results. The patient had additional tests that included rheumatoid factor at 24 IU/mL, total hemolytic complement level (CH50) at 28 (units not provided), C3 level at 75.50 mg/dL, C4 level at 1.67 mg/dL, Westergren erythrocycte sedimentation rate at 48 mm/h, high sensitive C-reactive protein at 5.24 mg/dL, antiphosphatidylserine IgG at 19 (units not provided) and antiphosphatidylserine IgM at 64 (units not provided). The patient had also a chest radiograph and doppler studies of blood flow of the extremities that were also normal. Additionally, the patient had an initial cryoglobulins test that was negative. Two weeks later, the patient had his rheumatoid factor measured and it was 54 IU/mL.  The patient then started treatment with oral prednisone 20mg daily; two weeks later, the dose was increased to 40mg daily. However, the patient continued developing acral purpuric lesions and had increasing acral pain, therefore, the patient was started on therapy with rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/mm2 weekly, four infusions total. By the fourth infusion, the patient's cryoglobulins were detected for the first time. As the patient's did not change, an additional two infusions regimen was added given monthly. Three months after the patient's last infusion with rituximab, his acral lesions healed roughly and the therapy with prednisone was slowly tapered and stopped.   Eighteen months after the patient's initial presentation, the patient had increasing acral ischemic symptoms and elevated IgM and low C4, which led to plan other four rituximab infusions. Nevertheless, after the second set of infusions, the patient developed palpable purpura on his legs. The patient then had a biopsy and leukocytoclastic vasculitis was found and direct immunofluoresencse microscopy found IgG in the vessel walls. Therefore, the patient was again treated with prednisone 40mg daily which was tapered and stopped over three weeks and the hematologist administered another another four weekly infusions of intravenous rituximab. Subsequently the patient was referred to a different facility and type II cryoglobulin was identified and characterized as IgM k monoclonal cryoglobulinemia with polyclonal IgG cryoglobulinemia. The patient also had a bone marrow biopsy and the results was normal.   Twenty months after the initial presentation, the patient started therapy with oral cyclophosphamide 100mg daily and oral prednisone 10mg daily. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings were controlled with this regimen and three years after his initial presentation, the patient's doses had been decreasing: cyclophosphamide 50mg every other day and prednisone 5mg daily, however, the patients low level of C4 persisted.

No illness or sickness/cold within the past 4-5 months. Diagnosis from medical office: transverse myelitis (TM) after being hospitalized for five days at Hospital.     Symptoms Timeline:  November 26 to 28: Worst headache of my life (I never get headaches). I had throbbing neck and spinal pain. Front and back parts of the head in severe pain. Lasted over the course of 3 days. Although the headache subsided with around-the-clock Tylenol (500mg every 6-8 hours), I still had major throbbing neck/spinal pain from Nov 26 onward. I started feeling some urinary discomfort as well. The urinary discomfort was not as severe as a UTI-type feeling, but some discomfort before urinating that persisted on.   November 28th and on: Tingly-ness and numbness in upper arms, lower arms, and hands (both right and left arms). Hyper-sensitivity to arms/arm hairs. It was painful to touch anything cold (for example: when washing my hands, the cold water was horribly painful. Even the room temperature soap on my hands hurt). Numbness and ?loss of circulation-type feeling? in hands that would come and go. It felt like my hands were getting numb or going to sleep.   November 30th on: Major body aches across whole-of-body and weakness in legs in particular. I started noticing that I could not run?basically, I tried working out in the morning (my typical morning routine) and could not accelerate past a walking pace (3.5 to 4 MPH). My legs would get locked up and I would lose my balance when I tried to accelerate beyond a walking pace (My normal running pace is 7.5 MPH). I could feel intense weakness in the legs and overall body aches/pains (not muscle related, but a different type of pain). General exhaustion also was felt (sleeping much earlier than usual, etc.).   December 2: Continuation of all symptoms described above, so I decided to go to urgent Care  on the evening on December 2nd to check blood work, vitals, flu. All results came back normal, however the PAC wrote in her report that I ?must follow up with a neurologist: and to ?go to the ER immediately if any new or worsening symptoms develop. Red flags to go to ER.? Verbally she told me to get an MRI and gave me neurologist referral information.   December 3 morning: Was slated to workout in the morning, but could not physically imagine doing so due to the body aches/pain I felt while in bed. I canceled my workout class from bed. An hour later, I tried to get up to use the restroom. I could not keep my balance or walk on my feet properly. I was walking on the sides of my feet because my feet would not let me step flat. After a couple of steps, I started feeling dizzy, losing my vision, and had trouble breathing. I was aware that I was in the process of passing out, so I got on the ground and sat on the floor?gasping for air. I had my phone on me and immediately called my mother who stayed on the line (I was about to call 911 but stayed on the line with my mom). After a few seconds, I crawled to my kitchen and ate some caramelized popcorn and drank some water. I was conscious. My neighbor then came to my unit immediately and took me to the ER. I arrived at the ER around 9am.   December 3 ER: Vitals looked good. Initial testing looked normal. No flu. Their initial tests that looked at inflammation markers came back with normal results. We insisted on some neuro-related check-ups, as recommended from the urgent care PAC. ER sent me to MRI around 3PM. Results came back with many abnormalities/legions in the spinal cord in the particular. Major inflammation of the upper spinal cord and neck. Neurologist consult came in immediately and wanted to start 1000 mg steroid via IV in the ER immediately. Lumber puncture was done in the ER immediately. I was admitted to the hospital that night. From what I can see my patient chart portal, 30+ tests were done from both blood work and lumbar puncture. According to my doctors? analyses, all results have since come back normal or negative. Looks like this was not something triggered by chronic or bacterial cause.    December 3 ? 7: received 1000 mg steroid via IV per day. After day 3, most clinical symptoms such as body aches and arm tinglyness/numbness started subsiding. The treatment seemed to be working quite well. I was discharged on Saturday, December 7th. Upon discharge, I was prescribed to take a tapering steroid treatment orally (60mg for 3 days, 50 mg for 3 days, 40mg for 3 days, 30 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10 mg for 3 days).

On awakening the morning of Sept. 6, 2019, I had sharp pain in my lower legs: a burning sensation (hot and prickly).   Thereafter I have developed weakness in my legs such that I cannot walk without pain.  I must use a cane or crutches.  Thereafter I made an appointment with a Neurologist; tests showed severe peripheral neuropathy.   Shortly thereafter I consulted with my acupuncturist who is very familiar with my health history over the past 25 years.  In her opinion, the condition is most likely a vaccine reaction.  This diagnosis was confirmed by my primary care physician.  At present my treatment plan includes: (1) weekly acupuncture treatments; (2) weekly physical therapy; (3) weekly massage therapy; and (4) 3 times weekly chiropractic laser treatment.    I am advised that the nerve damage is permanent and potential for a cure is slim: I can barely walk.  Summary:  Based on the facts and the opinions of my several health care providers, I am convinced that I have been injured by improper administration of Shingrix vaccine.  Prior to the injury and since the time of my youth I have been very physically active (intercollegiate competitive athlete).  At the time of the injury I was active in a family owned business in which I can no longer function.  My husband and I are being forced to close the business.   My ability to maintain my home is severely impaired and the costs of my treatment and assistance with home maintenance are a significant burden.  At present I am in the process of re-activating my professional licensing: I am a qualified Mental Health Counselor.  I am scheduled to take the licensing examination in January.  My opportunities are limited by the crippling condition.",,,,,,,,Y,U,09/05/2019,09/06/2019,1,My neurologist is Dr who performed a nerve response test on my legs and has the report.,PHM,,"Losartan, Diazapam, Armour, Ubiquinol",None.,"Hypertension (Stage 1), Low Thyroid",,,2,12/15/2019,,Y,,None.

The authors commented, ""This was the first large-scale, post-licensure vaccine safety review of atypical shoulder pain and dysfunction following influenza vaccination. Our results suggest that reports of atypical shoulder pain and dysfunction following IIV were uncommon, given the amount of influenza vaccine distributed."" we cannot conclude that these reports represent true incident shoulder injuries caused by vaccination. However, we also cannot rule out that some of these cases might be new shoulder injuries or aggravation of existing shoulder injuries resulting from improperly administered vaccines too close to the underlying structures and tissues of the shoulder joint. Reasons for the increase in shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) claims filed with the Compensation Program (CP) were likely due to factors other than a true increase in causally-associated vaccine-related shoulder injuries. The CP covers all vaccines routinely recommended for use in children regardless of the age of the vaccine recipient. While we cannot establish cause and effect based on VAERS reports, these findings suggest that improper placement of an intramuscular vaccine injection too high on the arm and too close to the underlying structures of the shoulder joint might be a possible contributing factor for atypical shoulder pain and dysfunction. It is possible that some individuals in our analysis had minor shoulder problems unrelated to vaccination that would subsequently resolve; however, in most reports, we were unable to determine how long the shoulder pain and dysfunction persisted because reports were made to VAERS while patients were still experiencing signs and symptoms. Reported contributing factors, such as IIV given ��too high"" on the arm are primarily subjective, self-reported, and not verifiable. In most reports, documentation of past medical history was limited so pre-existing shoulder problems or other risk factors that could explain signs and symptoms might not have been identified. However, based on VAERS reports alone, we cannot draw any conclusions about a potential association with respect to place of vaccination. The author concluded, ""Reports to VAERS of atypical shoulder pain and dysfunction following IIV were relatively uncommon and stable during the seven influenza seasons in our review, with no indication of a recent increase in reporting. In total, we identified 1220 reports during a time period in which almost 1 billion doses of IIV had been distributed. Some of these case reports might represent true shoulder injuries that were caused or aggravated by an improperly administered vaccine. If some of these reports are the result of poor injection technique then they are preventable. Healthcare provider awareness, education and training, and adherence to best practices for vaccine administration are important focus areas for prevention. CDC has resources available on safe vaccine administration practices.

However, we also cannot rule out that some of these cases might be new shoulder injuries or aggravation of existing shoulder injuries resulting from improperly administered vaccines too close to the underlying structures and tissues of the shoulder joint.

While we cannot establish cause and effect based on VAERS reports, these findings suggest that improper placement of an intramuscular vaccine injection too high on the arm and too close to the underlying structures of the shoulder joint might be a possible contributing factor for atypical shoulder pain and dysfunction. It is possible that some individuals in our analysis had minor shoulder problems unrelated to vaccination that would subsequently resolve; however, in most reports, we were unable to determine how long the shoulder pain and dysfunction persisted because reports were made to VAERS while patients were still experiencing signs and symptoms.

In total, we identified 1220 reports during a time period in which almost 1 billion doses of IIV had been distributed. Some of these case reports might represent true shoulder injuries that were caused or aggravated by an improperly administered vaccine. If some of these reports are the result of poor injection technique then they are preventable. Healthcare provider awareness, education and training, and adherence to best practices for vaccine administration are important focus areas for prevention. CDC has resources available on safe vaccine administration practices. Efforts to address healthcare practice issues around potential shoulder injuries related to vaccination could include the development of a standardized case definition similar to what has been done with local injection site reactions, evaluation of pathophysiology and risk factors, and determining best injection practices and effective prevention and treatment options.""

Shortly after receiving zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the pt suffered blurry vision in the right eye (OD) and was diagnosed with central corneal opacity of the right eye and herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis. As a direct and proximate result of the Company's defective zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient's symptoms have resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using the Company's product. As a result of the manufacture, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and/or sale of zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX), the patient sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, as a tragic consequence of the Company's wrongful conduct, the pt suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result of the Company's conduct, the patient has suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The causality was related.   Upon internal review, the events of central corneal opacity of the right eye and herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis were determined to be medically significant.

When she injected the vaccine I looked over at my shoulder because it was more painful than usual and I was also surprised at how high up on my arm it was.  Within 30 minutes of receiving the injection I was experiencing abnormal sensations in my 4th and fifth fingers on my L hand and the sensation that my wrist watch was cutting off my circulation although I could (in actuality) slip a finger between the band and my skin. My shoulder had a deep ache within it and I had deep pain at the injection site. I reported this to my supervisor and was seen by, PA, the Associate Medical Director. She agreed the symptoms were concerning and asked me to update her. That night the abnormal sensations resolved but the joint pain worsened and by the morning I could barely move it above my head. I texted PA and she recommended I see my PCP. I made an appointment with my PCP for next available (Monday  10/20) but I cancelled it because it felt like I had the pain under control and didn't want to miss work. Over the next few days I took Motrin in high amounts, used hot packs and ice packs. This continued through the next week. This same week I began having a spastic cough, severe pain in my ribs and abdominals as well as difficulty catching my breath or taking a deep breath. I ended up in urgent care due to this issue on  10/25.   I stopped taking Motrin and the pain  in my shoulder came back, but even worse during the evening on 10/27. The pain woke me from my sleep . I made an appointment with my PCP and went to see Dr. for both my shoulder pain and the respiratory issue on 10/29.  Dr. put me on a burst of oral steroids from  10/30 - 11/3 for the shortness of breath/coughing. During this time, I also experienced complete respite from the shoulder pain and enjoyed my full range of motion and strength for the first time since the vaccine was given. She also sent a referral for me to see an orthopedist.   I saw Dr., (an orthopedist) on  11/15. At the time of our appointment I was not in pain because I was actually back on steroids (11/12-11/16) for continued respiratory symptoms.  He opted to not give me a cortisone injection because of the oral steroids I was receiving. He prescribed physical therapy to me and told me to come back when I was off the oral steroids if PT did not resolve the issue.  My PCP diagnosed me with SIRVA. (Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration).  I have been in PT since 11/18. I am still symptomatic except for when I am on oral steroids.  I have an MRI scheduled for 12/29 and a corticosteroid injection  scheduled for 1/2/20.",,,,,,,,,N,10/16/2019,10/16/2019,0,Shoulder XRay: 11/15 Shoulder MRI upcoming: 11/29,PUB,,,,,,,2,12/19/2019,,Y,,

0853677,12/20/2019,MI,,,,U,,"Suspected vaccination failure; Influenza A; This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of vaccination failure in a child patient who received Flu Seasonal TIV Dresden (Flu trivalent vaccine) for prophylaxis.   On an unknown date, the patient received the 1st dose of Flu trivalent vaccine. On an unknown date, more than a week after receiving Flu trivalent vaccine, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant) and influenza a virus infection (serious criteria hospitalization). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure and influenza a virus infection were unknown.  The reporter considered the vaccination failure and influenza a virus infection to be related to Flu trivalent vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a patient aged between 2 and 8 years of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with unspecified trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  This was a test-negative design study that examined data retrospectively over 3 influenza seasons. It was estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 8 years at hospitals in the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 influenza seasons, using the test-negative design. For each season, it was estimated VE for fully and partially vaccinated children, using complete vaccine receipt histories from birth. [Individuals were excluded if they received their vaccine less than 14 days before hospitalization, received the live attenuated influenza vaccine or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV) in the current influenza season, were hospitalized outside the influenza season, or were tested for influenza more than 10 days after hospital admission. It was considered the beginning of the season to be the week when the first influenza positive sample was reported, and the end of the season to be the week when sentinel surveillance ended, based on MoH surveillance. Comorbid conditions were defined for the 2 years before hospitalization. It was included 326 influenza-positive case patients and 2821 influenza-negative controls (140 case patients and 971 controls from 2015-2016, 36 case patients and 1069 controls from 2016-2017, and 150 case patients and 781 controls from 2017-2018)]. The patient did not receive the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV) in the current influenza season. The patient were not hospitalized outside the influenza season. The patient had at least one comorbidity (unspecified) for the 2 years before hospitalization. No information on patient's medical history, family history, or concurrent condition was provided. On an unspecified date from 1 September of the 2016-2017 influenza season, the patient received partial vaccination of unspecified trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. [Vaccination is the most effective strategy for prevention of influenza-related illness and is recommended annually by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for individuals aged more than or equal to 6 months. Both recommendations specify that children aged 6 months through 8 years receive 2 doses of influenza vaccine if they have not received more than 1 influenza vaccine previously. Vaccinated individuals were those who had received TIV from 1 September of the influenza season of interest and more than or equal to 14 days before hospital admission. Fully vaccinated individuals were those who had received a current season vaccine (TIV only) and had received more than or equal to 2 influenza vaccines previously, or had received 2 current season vaccines more than or equal to 14 days apart. Partially vaccinated individuals were those who had received a current season vaccine and did not meet the criteria for full vaccination. During 2016-2017, children in second grade received influenza vaccine in school, but records of these vaccinations were not routinely entered into the electronic medical record. To evaluate the impact of these potentially incomplete vaccination records, it was conducted 2 additional analyses; it was removed 2016-2017 data from the overall VE estimate, and estimated influenza VE in the 2016-2017 excluding individuals more than 5 years old as of 1 September 2016]. The patient had received a current season vaccine (TIV only) and had not received more than or equal to 2 influenza vaccines previously, or had not received 2 current season vaccines more than or equal to 14 days apart. The patient received the vaccine more than or equal to 14 days before hospitalization. On an unspecified date between 8 October 2016 and 16 April 2017 in 2016-2017 influenza season, less than 10 days after hospital admission, the patient was tested for influenza. [Influenza case patients were individuals who tested positive for influenza by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during a hospital admission. The majority of these hospitalizations were in children who were male (55.2%), aged 6 months to less than 2 years old (60.7%), and had more than or equal to 1 comorbid condition (54.3%). The 2016-2017 season had few positive specimens (n = 36), all influenza A. The 2015-16 season occurred between 11 October 2015 and 16 April 2016, the 2016-17 season between 8 October 2016 and 16 April 2017. For the 2017-18 season, it was included hospitalizations from 21 October 2017 through 18 March 2018, the latest date that data were available at the time of analysis, and three weeks before the end of the influenza season]. The patient had tested positive for influenza A by RT-PCR during hospital admission. This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of influenza A infection and unspecified trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The author stated, ""This study, the first to evaluate influenza VE against hospitalization, found that influenza vaccine was effective in preventing hospitalization associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in fully vaccinated children aged 6 months to 8 years across 3 influenza seasons. Among fully vaccinated children, the vaccine was effective against influenza A in 2 of 3 seasons and against influenza B in 2017-2018. Estimated VE for partial vaccination was consistently lower than VE for full vaccination. Young children are at high risk for severe influenza-related outcomes, including hospitalization and death. Delayed hospital presentation could increase the likelihood of false-negative RT-PCR results if the infection has cleared before testing. VE. To reduce inclusion of false-negative results, it was excluded individuals who were tested more than 10 days after hospital admission. It was included individuals tested up to 10 days before admission because previous study findings suggest that children may shed influenza for a long time, with a substantial decrease in shedding after 10 days."" The author concluded, ""It was found influenza vaccine to be effective against hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed influenza in fully vaccinated children aged 6 months to 8 years from 2015 to 2018. The VE for partial vaccination was consistently lower than for full vaccination. There was also high VE against influenza A in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 and against influenza B in 2017-2018. It was found evidence for cross-lineage protection from vaccination when TIV included B/Victoria but not when TIV included B/Yamagata, though these estimates rely on small sample sizes and have wide CIs. The findings suggesting that influenza VE reduces the risk for severe disease in children further strengthen current recommendations for annual influenza vaccine in children. The higher VE for children who were fully vaccinated is consistent with current guidelines that recommend 2 vaccines for vaccine-naive children through age 8.""

On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure and influenza a virus infection were unknown.   The reporter considered the vaccination failure and influenza a virus infection to be related to Flu trivalent vaccine and Flu trivalent vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a patient aged less than 2 years of unspecified gender, who was vaccinated with unspecified trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.  This was a test-negative design study that examined data retrospectively over 3 influenza seasons. It was estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza hospitalization among children aged 6 months to 8 years at hospitals in the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 influenza seasons, using the test-negative design. For each season, it was estimated VE for fully and partially vaccinated children, using complete vaccine receipt histories from birth. [Individuals were excluded if they received their vaccine less than 14 days before hospitalization, received the live attenuated influenza vaccine or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV) in the current influenza season, were hospitalized outside the influenza season, or were tested for influenza more than 10 days after hospital admission. It was considered the beginning of the season to be the week when the first influenza positive sample was reported, and the end of the season to be the week when sentinel surveillance ended, based on MoH surveillance. Comorbid conditions were defined for the 2 years before hospitalization. It was included 326 influenza-positive case patients and 2821 influenza-negative controls (140 case patients and 971 controls from 2015-2016, 36 case patients and 1069 controls from 2016-2017, and 150 case patients and 781 controls from 2017-2018)]. The patient did not receive the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV) in the current influenza season. The patient were not hospitalized outside the influenza season. The patient had at least one comorbidity (unspecified) for the 2 years before hospitalization. No information on patient's medical history, family history, or concurrent condition was provided. On an unspecified date from 1 September of the 2016-2017 influenza season, the patient received full vaccination of unspecified trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. [Vaccination is the most effective strategy for prevention of influenza-related illness and is recommended annually by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for individuals aged more than or equal to 6 months. Both recommendations specify that children aged 6 months through 8 years receive 2 doses of influenza vaccine if they have not received more than 1 influenza vaccine previously. Vaccinated individuals were those who had received TIV from 1 September of the influenza season of interest and more than or equal to 14 days before hospital admission. Fully vaccinated individuals were those who had received a current season vaccine (TIV only) and had received more than or equal to 2 influenza vaccines previously, or had received 2 current season vaccines more than or equal to 14 days apart. Partially vaccinated individuals were those who had received a current season vaccine and did not meet the criteria for full vaccination. During 2016-2017, children in second grade received influenza vaccine in school, but records of these vaccinations were not routinely entered into the electronic medical record. To evaluate the impact of these potentially incomplete vaccination records, it was conducted 2 additional analyses; it was removed 2016-2017 data from the overall VE estimate, and estimated influenza VE in the 2016-2017 excluding individuals more than 5 years old as of 1 September 2016]. The patient received a current season vaccine (TIV only) and had received more than or equal to 2 influenza vaccines previously, or had received 2 current season vaccines more than or equal to 14 days apart. The patient received the vaccine more than or equal to 14 days before hospitalization. On an unspecified date between 8 October 2016 and 16 April 2017 in 2016-2017 influenza season, less than 10 days after hospital admission, the patient was tested for influenza. [Influenza case patients were individuals who tested positive for influenza by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during a hospital admission. The majority of these hospitalizations were in children who were male (55.2%), aged 6 months to less than 2 years old (60.7%), and had more than or equal to 1 comorbid condition (54.3%). The 2016-2017 season had few positive specimens (n = 36), all influenza A. The 2015-16 season occurred between 11 October 2015 and 16 April 2016, the 2016-17 season between 8 October 2016 and 16 April 2017. For the 2017-18 season, it was included hospitalizations from 21 October 2017 through 18 March 2018, the latest date that data were available at the time of analysis, and three weeks before the end of the influenza season]. The patient had tested positive for influenza A by RT-PCR during hospital admission. This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. This case has been considered as serious due to suspected vaccination failure and hospitalization. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of influenza A infection and unspecified trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The author stated, ""This study, the first to evaluate influenza VE against hospitalization, found that influenza vaccine was effective in preventing hospitalization associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in fully vaccinated children aged 6 months to 8 years across 3 influenza seasons. Among fully vaccinated children, the vaccine was effective against influenza A in 2 of 3 seasons and against influenza B in 2017-2018. Estimated VE for partial vaccination was consistently lower than VE for full vaccination. Young children are at high risk for severe influenza-related outcomes, including hospitalization and death. Delayed hospital presentation could increase the likelihood of false-negative RT-PCR results if the infection has cleared before testing. VE. To reduce inclusion of false-negative results, it was excluded individuals who were tested more than 10 days after hospital admission. It was included individuals tested up to 10 days before admission because previous study findings suggest that children may shed influenza for a long time, with a substantial decrease in shedding after 10 days."" The author concluded, ""It was found influenza vaccine to be effective against hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed influenza in fully vaccinated children aged 6 months to 8 years from 2015 to 2018. The VE for partial vaccination was consistently lower than for full vaccination. There was also high VE against influenza A in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 and against influenza B in 2017-2018. It was found evidence for cross-lineage protection from vaccination when TIV included B/Victoria but not when TIV included B/Yamagata, though these estimates rely on small sample sizes and have wide CIs. The findings suggesting that influenza VE reduces the risk for severe disease in children further strengthen current recommendations for annual influenza vaccine in children. The higher VE for children who were fully vaccinated is consistent with current guidelines that recommend 2 vaccines for vaccine-naive children through age 8.""

The mother's historical medical condition included bacterial vaginosis. The mother's current medical conditions included nausea, depression, epilepsy, anxiety and gestational hypertension. The mother was RhD negative.   The mother's concomitant medications included folic acid as supplement, Diclegis (doxylamine succinate, pyridoxine hydrochloride) for nausea, Rhogam (anti-D immunoglobulin) as Rh negative vaccine, Lamictal (lamotrigine) for epilepsy, Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride) for depression, Flagyl (metronidazole benzoate) for bacterial vaginosis and hydroxyzine for anxiety.  The mother's obstetrical history included one previous pregnancy that ended as spontaneous abortion. The mother had no maternal/paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCM).    The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 10-Mar-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The mother's estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated delivery date (CEDD) were both 15-Dec-2019. The mother did not consume tobacco, alcohol and illicit-drugs during pregnancy.  On 03-Jun-2019, the subject's mother performed nuchal translucency and first trimester screen and no MCM was noted.  On 01-Jul-2019, the subject's mother performed second trimester screen and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP/serum markers) and no MCM was noted.

The subject's historical condition included bacterial vaginosis.   The subject's current conditions included nausea, depression, epilepsy and anxiety. The subject was RhD negative.   The subject's concomitant medications included folic acid as supplement, Diclegis (doxylamine succinate, pyridoxine hydrochloride) for nausea, Rhogam (anti-D immunoglobulin) as Rh-negative vaccine, Lamictal (lamotrigine) for epilepsy, Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride) for depression, Flagyl (metronidazole benzoate) for bacterial vaginosis and hydroxyzine for anxiety.  The subject had one previous pregnancy which ended as spontaneous abortion. The subject had no maternal/paternal history with major congenital malformations (MCM).    The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 10-Mar-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The subject's estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated delivery date (CEDD) were both 15-Dec-2019. The subject did not consume tobacco, alcohol and illicit-drugs during pregnancy.  On 03-Jun-2019, the subject performed nuchal translucency and first trimester screen and no MCM was noted.  On 01-Jul-2019, the subject performed second trimester screen and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP/serum markers) and no MCM was noted.  On 22-Jul-2019, the subject performed anatomy ultrasound and no MCM was noted.  On 17-Sep-2019, at gestational age of 27 weeks, the subject was administered Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD (influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, batch number: 261200, dose: 0.5 mL, route of administration, anatomical location and expiry date: not reported) (explicitly coded as �Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation.

On an unspecified date in 2019, after vaccination, the subject developed gestational hypertension.   On 22-Nov-2019, at gestational age of 36.7 weeks, the subject vaginally delivered live male neonate. The birth weight of the neonate was 3232 g, no data reported for head circumference and length. Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) score at one minute was 8, at five minutes was 9 and no data was reported for APGAR score at ten minutes. No MCM was identified at birth.  The event of preterm delivery was considered serious due to the criterion of medically significance.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment to Flucelvax QIVc.

Causality was confounded by patient's obstetrical history of previous spontaneous abortion, non-company co-suspect vaccine TDAP administered on the same day and concomitant drugs used during pregnancy.
